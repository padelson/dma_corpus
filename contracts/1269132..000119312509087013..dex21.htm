well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Newco, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS and INTERPRETATIONS

1.1 _Certain Definitions_. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the
following capitalized terms shall have the following respective meanings:

(a) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " shall mean an agreement that
is either (i) in effect as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
(ii) executed, delivered and effective after the execution, delivery and
effectiveness of this Agreement, in either case containing provisions that
require any counter-party(ies) thereto (and any of its(their) representatives
named therein) that receive    material non-public information of or with respect to the Company to keep
such information confidential, provided, in each case, that such
confidentiality and other provisions (including "standstill" or similar
provisions) are no less restrictive in the aggregate to such counter-
party(ies) (and any of its(their) representatives named therein) than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that if the terms
of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement are less restrictive in the
aggregate to such counter-party(ies) (and any of its (their) representatives
named therein) than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, then
notwithstanding the foregoing, such agreement will be deemed an "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement" if the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality
Agreement so as to make the Confidentiality Agreement as restrictive in the
aggregate as the confidentiality agreement signed by such counterparty(ies).

(b) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any offer or proposal (other than
an offer or proposal by Newco or Merger Sub) to engage in an Acquisition
Transaction.

(c) " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean any transaction or series of
related transactions, alone or in combination, (other than the Merger)
involving:

from the Company and/or any other Person(s), of shares of Company Common Stock
representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the Company Common Stock
outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other
acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any

(20%) of the Company Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such tender or exchange offer;

(ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any Person or
"group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of more

the date of such sale, transfer, acquisition or disposition); or

(iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving the
Company pursuant to which any Person or "group" (as defined in or under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) would hold shares of Company Common Stock
representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the Company Common Stock
outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction.

(d) " _Affiliate_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other Person
which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common
control with such Person. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence,
the term "control" (including, with correlative meanings, the terms

amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all

case that are applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Based Awards and at the Effective Time each Company Stock-Based Award
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the

interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share
Price less (B) the exercise price per share attributable to such Company
Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ "). The payment of the Option Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required taxes. The Company agrees to take all
action necessary to effect this cancellation of Company Options upon the
Effective Time and to give effect to this _Section 2.7(e)_ (including,

each holder of a Company Option the Option Consideration (if any), less any
applicable withholding taxes, required to be paid to any such holder of a
Company Option pursuant to this _Section 2.7(e)_. The cancellation of a

rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such Company Option.

(f) (A) all Company Stock-Based Awards and all Company Stock Plans shall
terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Employee

participating in the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Final Offering_ ") shall not be
permitted (x) to increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll
contributions thereunder from the rate in effect when the Final Offering
commenced, or (y) to make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or
following the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual who is not

that the Offering Period will be shortened by setting a new exercise date and
that the exercise date shall be 10 business days following the date of the
delivery of such notice.

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Effective Time, Newco shall deposit (or cause to
be deposited, including by utilizing the Companys cash) with the Payment
Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_ , an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock and holders
of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options become entitled under this
_Article II_. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed
by Newco or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States
of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America (such cash being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). To
the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of
the Exchange Fund, the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by this _Article II_ , or all or any portion of the Exchange Fund
is unavailable Newco to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this
_Article II_ for any reason, Newco shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for
distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such payments contemplated by this _Article II_. Any income from investment of
the Exchange Fund shall be payable to Newco.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Newco and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
uncertificated  



 

-16-  shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ ") (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and/or (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Newco, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and
the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of
an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares, by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment
Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this _Section 2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has
paid to Newco (or any agent designated by Newco) any transfer Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established
to the satisfaction of Newco (or any agent designated by Newco) that such
transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Newco and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company
Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under U.S. federal or state, local or non-U.S. Tax laws. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



 

-17- (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Newco_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Newco upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
solely to Newco (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), as
general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Per Share Price to
which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time or at such
earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto. 

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of Uncertificated Shares or a Certificate theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price
payable therefor in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.7_, or in
the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section
2.7(c)_. The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_.

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share
Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section 2.7_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Newco may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Newco, the
Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the
Company and Merger Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

organized, validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law, and has

and assets, except where the failure to be in good standing would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (to the extent the "good standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The

The Company is not in violation of the Charter or its bylaws.

the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation of
the Merger have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company and no additional corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder or, subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Newco and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (a) may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally, and (b) is
subject to general principles of equity.



 

-19- 3.3 _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover laws_.

applicable provisions of the DGCL (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

view, to the holders of Company Common Stock.

(c) Assuming that the representations of Newco and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.7_ are true and correct, the Company Board has taken all necessary
actions such that the restrictions on business combinations set forth
in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable "anti-takeover"
law will not be applicable to the Merger.

or series of Company Capital Stock that is necessary under applicable law,
the Charter and the Companys bylaws to consummate the Merger.

3.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger do not and will not (i) violate
or conflict with any provision of the Charter or bylaws of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or

acceleration under, any Material Contract, (iii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in _Section 3.6_ and, in the case of the consummation of

bound, or (iv) result in the creation of any lien upon any of the properties
or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of
each of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, for such violations, conflicts,

or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the ability of the
Company to fully perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement.

3.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing being referred to herein as a " _Consent_ "), any Governmental

the conditions set forth therein, to invest the cash amounts set forth therein
in Newco to fully finance the Merger and other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) The Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, and the commitment
set forth in the Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. The Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to the Company on the
date hereof, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Newco and, to the knowledge of Newco, the Investor for so long
as it remains in full force and effect. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in

contemplated by the Commitment Letter, together with the available cash of

Letter, subject to the Companys compliance with this Agreement and the
satisfaction (or waiver by Newco) of the conditions in _Sections 7.1_ and

commitment and other fees that have been incurred and are due and payable in
connection with the Commitment Letter, and Newco will pay when due all other
commitment and other fees arising under the Commitment Letter as and when

connection with the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or that has or would have the effect of preventing, impairing or

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
during the period commencing with the execution, delivery and effectiveness of

agents, representatives and advisors) any non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by affording to any Person (and/or
such Persons Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants,
agents, representatives and advisors) access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to the personnel,

agreement), or (vi) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract

Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that any Continuing Party shall
cease to be a Continuing Party for all purposes under this Agreement upon the
later of (i) 12:01 a.m., Pacific time, on the 45th day following the date of

_Section 5.3(f)_ shall have commenced, the earlier of (A) if the Continuing
Partys proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal, the third Business Day
thereafter if the Continuing Partys proposal does not once again (taking into
account any modifications or amendments that such Continuing Party may
have made to such Superior Proposal during the three Business Day Period)
constitute a Superior Proposal during such three Business Day period (it being
understood that if the Continuing Party shall make, amend or modify its
proposal during such period, it shall be considered a new proposal for
purposes of _Section 5.3(f)_) and (B) the end of a Notice Period if such
Continuing Partys proposal remains a Superior Proposal (the " _Continuing
Discussion Period_ "). No later than the first Business Day following the No-
Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall provide Newco with a complete list
of Continuing Parties, including their identity.



 

-42- (d) Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth in this _Section 5.3_

committee thereof may, directly or indirectly through one or more
Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,

Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement to (provided that the Company shall promptly make available to
Newco any material non-public information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not
previously made available to Newco):

(i) any Continuing Party (and/or such Continuing Partys Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and
advisors); and/or

(ii) any Person (and/or such Persons Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors) that
has made or delivered to the Company a written Acquisition Proposal after the
No-Shop Period Start Date that was not solicited in breach of _Section
5.3(b)_,  _provided_ that solely in the case of this clause (ii), the Company
Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
(A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable laws.

date hereof (whether before or after the No-Shop Period Start Date), neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter
into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive
agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, (x) the
Company Board may if it has not received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change, or (y) if the Company has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and that the
Company Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, (1) the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to
such Superior Proposal, and (2) the Company Board may authorize the Company
to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if:

(i) in the case of _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ above, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Laws;

(ii) in the case of _clause (x)_ above, the Company shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations under this  _Section 5.3_ with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal (if any) relating to such Company Board
Recommendation Change;



 

-43- (iii) in the case of _clause (y)_ above, the Company shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.3_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal;

(iv) in the case of _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ above, (A) the Company shall
have provided prior written notice to Newco at least three (3) Business Days
in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect that absent any revision
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)_, which notice shall specify
the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination,
including in the case of _Section 5.3(f)(y)_ the identity of the party making
the Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant
documents relating to such Superior Proposal; and (B) prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, (1)
negotiate with Newco and any representative or agent of Newco (including,
without limitation, any director or officer of Newco) (collectively, " _Newco
Representatives_ ") in good faith (to the extent Newco desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that the Company Board would not effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
and/or terminate this Agreement, and (2) permit Newco and the Newco
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent Newco
desires to make such presentation); provided, that in the event of any
material or substantive revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Newco and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3_ (including this  _Section 5.3(f)_) with
respect to such new written notice; and

(v) in the case of _clause (y)_ above, the Company shall have validly
terminated this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_, including the
payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
8.3(b)(iii)_.

The Company shall comply with the provisions of this _Section 5.3(f)_
regardless of whether the Superior Proposal is from a Continuing Party. None
of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board shall
enter into any binding agreement with any Person to limit or not to give prior
notice to Newco of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

of the Company (including, without limitation, any director or officer of the
Company or its Subsidiaries) indicating, in connection with such notice, the

this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , without limiting the Companys
obligation to convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable, nothing herein shall prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (x) there are
holders of insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or
represented by a proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a
quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (y) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law, order
or a request from the SEC or its staff, or (z) the Company Board or any
authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate
to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to
give Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or
disclosure that the Company has sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made
available to Company Stockholders by issuing a press release,
filing materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any
Company Board Recommendation Change); and _provided further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Newco may require the Company to adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting one (1) time; and provided further
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be required to convene and hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting at any time prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day immediately
following the No-Shop Period Start Date.

6.5 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) withhold,
withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Newco, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse
to Newco, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend or
publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (C)
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation in the absence of
a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal within two (2) Business Days after
Newco so requests in writing, (D) fail to recommend against any publicly
announced Acquisition Proposal and reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation, in each case, within ten (10) Business Days following the
public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal and in any event at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, or (E) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the  



 

-48-  Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a "
_Company Board Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board or any authorized
committee thereof to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed
to be a Company Board Recommendation Change; and _provided further_ , that at
any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof may effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.3_.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board or any
authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined to
make in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided,
however_ , that, in either such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures
made by the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of
_Article VIII_ and shall be deemed a Company Board Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly recommends against any publicly announced
Acquisition Proposal and publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
within the time period set forth in _Section 6.5(a)(D)_ above.

(c) No Company Board Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the
Company Board for purposes of causing any anti-takeover laws to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, for the
avoidance of doubt, relieve the Company of its obligations under _Sections
6.3_ and _6.4_ to convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting (unless
this Agreement is earlier terminated). The Company shall promptly notify Newco
of any breach, to the Knowledge of the Company, of any existing
confidentiality agreement (including the standstill provisions thereof) by the
counterparty thereto, or any request by the counterparty to any existing
confidentiality agreement that the Company or the Company Board waive the
standstill provision thereof or authorize or give permission to such
counterparty to take actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the
standstill provisions thereof. To the extent Newco and/or the Company believes
that there has been a breach of any existing confidentiality agreement
(including the standstill provisions thereof) by the counterparty thereto,
upon Newcos request, the Company shall take all reasonable actions to enforce
such existing confidentiality agreement. 

6.6 _Financing_.

(a) Newco and Merger Sub shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do
(or cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Commitment Letter, including (i)
maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Newco and Merger Sub set forth in the Commitment
Letter that are within their control (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
Newco or Merger Subs conditions to Closing in _Article VII_ hereof), (iii) so
long as all conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_
are satisfied (or waived by Newco), consummating the financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter at the Effective Time (and in any event prior to the
Termination Date), and (iv) fully enforcing the Investors obligations (and
the rights of Newco and Merger Sub) under the Commitment Letter, including
(at the request of the Company) by filing one or more lawsuits (or assigning
such right to the Company) against the Investor to fully enforce the
Investors obligations (and the rights of Newco and Merger Sub) thereunder.



 

-49- (b) Neither Newco nor Merger Newco shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree to
amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term
of the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company.
Newco shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify the
Company of (i) the expiration or termination (or attempted or purported
termination, whether or not valid) of the Commitment Letter, or (ii) any
refusal by the Investor to provide, any stated intent by the Investor to
refuse to provide, or any expression of concern or reservation by the
Investor regarding the enforceability of the Commitment Letter subject to the
terms thereof or its ability to provide the full financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
assist Newco in the arrangement of any third party debt financing requested
by Newco for the purpose of financing the merger, fees and expenses incurred
in connection therewith, and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") (it being understood that the receipt of such Debt
Financing is not a condition to Closing), including: (i) participating in
meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions; (ii) assisting with the
preparation of materials for presentations, memoranda and similar
documents required in connection with Newcos Debt Financing; and (iii)
executing and delivering any definitive financing documents and certificates
as may be reasonably requested by Newco, provided that such documents will not
take effect until the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would require the Company to
agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give any indemnities prior to
the Effective Time for which it is not reimbursed or indemnified.

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all
actions necessary and within their power to ensure that no takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any
transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary and within their
power to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall afford Newco and its financial advisors, financing
sources, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that
(a) any applicable law or regulation (including any laws or regulations
relating to security clearances) requires the Company to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information, (b) access to such documents
or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
applicable to such documents or information, or (c) access to a Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound
would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right
terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; and _provided
further_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall be construed to require
the Company or its Representatives to prepare any appraisals or opinions. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys properties shall be subject
to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
shall not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Newco or any of its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 6.8_. 



 

-50- 6.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.10  _Directors  and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees
(and in the case of employees, pursuant to those indemnification agreements
set forth on _Section 6.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter made available
to Newco prior to the date of this Agreement) and any person who becomes a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the charters and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth
in the Charter and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year
period such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified
in any manner except as required by applicable law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates
(regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission,
occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person
delivers to Newco a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under
this _Section 6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is
fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation
will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any
such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained
by an Indemnified Person promptly after  



 

-51-  statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.10(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of
its Affiliates (including Newco) shall settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D
andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations
under this _Section 6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%)
of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in 
_Section 6.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided, however_ ,
that that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance, provided that the annual cost for such
"tail" policy shall not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. In the event that
the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of the Surviving Corporation (and Newco) under the first
sentence of this _Section 6.10(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation (or Newco) or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or Newco) set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.10_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in  _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section 6.10_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
charters, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at law or in equity).



 

-52- (f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.10_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Newco hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans listed on _Section 6.11(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, as applicable, will occur as of the
Effective Time, as applicable.

(b) Immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans
listed on _Section 6.11(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any Employee Plans, arrangements or
agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable law.

(c) To the extent that an Employee Plan is made available to any Continuing
Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and solely for purposes of
vacation accrual and severance pay, benefit entitlement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Newco or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee at any time and for any or
no reason, (ii) require Newco or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any Person (including any Continuing Employee or any dependent
or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties to this Agreement.

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Newco shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Newco and Merger Sub upon becoming aware
that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of
the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth or
inaccuracy, or such failure,  



 

-53-  would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Newco and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ to
fail to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of Newco and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to Newco
pursuant to this _Section 6.13(a)_.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, Newco
shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by Newco or Merger Sub in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of
Newco or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth
or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Newco or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions
to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and
_provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to
this _Section 6.13(b)_.

6.14 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Neither the Company, on the
one hand, nor Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public
release or make any public announcement or disclosure concerning this
Agreement or the Merger without the prior written consent of the other
party(ies) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), except as such release, announcement or disclosure may be
required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its all
reasonable efforts to allow the other party(ies) hereto reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.14_ shall not apply to any
release, announcement or disclosure made or proposed to be made by the Company
pursuant to  _Section 6.5_.

opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and/or prosecution of
any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary or Company representative or agent shall compromise, settle, come
to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless
Newco shall have consented in writing.

(h) by the Company, at any time prior to receiving the Requisite Stockholder

parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for
the terms of _Section 6.14_, this  _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and

and (b) subject to _Section 8.3_ and _Section 9.8_, nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from
liability for any breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement. In
addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement,
all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their terms.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable,
incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) _Company Payments_.

(i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is validly terminated (x) pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_ as a result of a breach by the Company of the covenants
contained in _Sections 5.3_ , _6.3_  or _6.4_ or (y) pursuant to _Section

the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made public, and (C) within one year following the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, either
a Competing Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into
a definitive agreement providing for a Competing Acquisition Transaction and
such Competing Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then the
Company shall pay to Fund Manager the Company Termination Fee (less any
expenses previously paid to Newco pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Fund Manager. 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Fund Manager an amount in cash

account or accounts designated in writing by Fund Manager, within two (2)
Business Days after the Company receives a written demand for payment from
Fund Manager.



 

-58- (iii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(h)_, the Company shall pay to Fund Manager the Company
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Fund Manager, as a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination.

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, whether nor not the Company Termination Fee may
be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events. The Fund Manager
shall have the right to assign the right to receive the Company Termination
fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion.

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. In the event that Fund Manager shall receive the
Company Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Newco, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and none of Newco, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of
its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

(e) _Expense Reimbursement_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either Newco or the Company pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)_ or by Newco
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, then the Company shall, following receipt of an
invoice therefor, promptly (in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay all
of Newcos reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Newco and its
Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing
and the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter) (the " _Newco
Expenses_ "), which amount shall in no event exceed $1,000,000 in the
aggregate, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Newco; _provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which
could require the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by
the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b_) shall not relieve the Company
of its obligations to pay the Newco Expenses pursuant to this _Section
8.3(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the Company of Newco
Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall not relieve the Company
of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_.

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Newco, Merger Sub and the Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of
such Company Stockholders under the DGCL without such approval.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

-60- 9.3 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties; provided, however, that Newco shall have the
right to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (i) from and after the Effective Time, in connection with a merger
or consolidation involving Newco or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of Newco or the Surviving Corporation, or (ii) from and
after the Effective Time, to any lender providing financing to Newco or the

Newco hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.4  _Confidentiality_. Newco, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Newco and the Company have previously executed a Mutual Confidential
Disclosure Agreement, dated August 8, 2008 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms until the Effective Time. For purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the execution of this Agreement by the Company
shall constitute written consent by the Company to allow Newco, Merger Sub
and Newcos Representatives to take all actions permitted or contemplated by
this Agreement, including contacting potential debt or, following the No-Shop
Period Start Date equity financing sources and entering into agreements with
such Persons, including stockholders or members or management as contemplated
by _Section 4.10_ and _Section 4.11_ hereof, so long as such Persons agree
to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement. 

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Guarantee, constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time
and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance
with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto. EACH PARTY
HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER NEWCO AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE
COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE
OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER
OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except
(a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of _Sections
6.10_ and _9.8(e)_ , and (b) subject to _Section 9.8_, after the Effective
Time and the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof,
the rights of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, Company Options
and Company Stock-Based Awards solely to receive the merger consideration set
forth in  _Article II_.



 

-61- 9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.8 _Remedies_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein (including, without limitation,
_Sections 9.8(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , and  _(e)_ below), any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. For purposes of clarity, the Company may not
seek any remedy except, and solely as provided in _Sections 9.8(c)_ and _(d)_
below, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or was otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or
Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants
or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Commitment Letter or
the Guarantee, the Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, the Commitment
Letter and the Guarantee by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement, the Commitment Letter and the
Guarantee, and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause
Newco and Merger Sub to fully enforce the terms of the Commitment letter
against the Investor to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to
the Commitment Letter and applicable laws and to thereafter cause the Merger
to be consummated, so long as all conditions to the Merger have been
satisfied. The Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or
Newco or Merger Sub, on the other hand, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Newco and
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

(c) The Company hereby agrees that specific performance shall be its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Newco or Merger Sub or any other
Person or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as provided in _Section 9.8(d)_ below, that
it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available for
breach under this Agreement, the Commitment Letter or the Guarantee or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including monetary damages).



 

-62- (d) If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce
the obligations of Newco and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to
a claim for specific performance brought against Newco and Merger Sub pursuant
to this _Section 9.8_ and has instead granted an award of damages for such
alleged breach against Newco or Guarantor, the Company may enforce such award
and accept damages for such alleged breach (which Newco agrees may include
damages based upon a decrease in share value or lost premium) only if, within
two (2) weeks following such determination, Newco and Merger Sub are not
willing to consummate the Merger in accordance with _Article II_ of this
Agreement. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any Legal Proceeding still
proceeding to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Newco and Merger
Sub consummate the Merger in accordance with _Article II_ of this Agreement or
are otherwise willing to do so.

(e) The Company further agrees that (x) the seeking of the remedies provided
for in _Section 9.8(b)_ by Newco or Merger Sub shall not in any respect
constitute a waiver by either Newco or Merger Sub of its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to either of them under this
Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in
_Section 9.8(b)_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y)
nothing set forth in _Section 9.8(a)_ shall require Newco or Merger Sub to
institute any proceeding for (or limit Newcos or Merger Subs right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under _Section 9.8(a)_
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article
VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to _Section 9.8(b)_ or anything
set forth in this _Section 9.8(e)_ restrict or limit Newcos or Merger Subs
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article
VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available
then or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary,
from and after the Effective Time, none of the Company, its Affiliates, or
their respective current or former directors, stockholders, optionholders,
officers or employees shall be entitled to seek or recover monetary or other
damages or relief (including equitable relief) against Newco, the Surviving
Corporation, the Guarantor, the Investor or any of their respective Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
except for (a) claims against the Surviving Corporation as set forth and
contemplated by _Section 6.10_ and (b) after the Effective Time and the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof, the claims
against the Surviving Corporation by holders of shares of the Company Common
Stock solely to receive the merger consideration (or, in lieu there of, to
enforce valid and perfected appraisal claims under Section 242 of the DGCL) as
set forth in _Article II_. If any Legal Proceedings instituted by the Company
or its Affiliates against Newco, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Investor or
any of their respective Affiliates are pending as of the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause such Legal Proceedings to be dismissed with prejudice as
of the Effective Time, except for claims against the Surviving Corporation as
set forth and contemplated by _Section 6.10_. The provisions of this _Section
9.8_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Guarantor, the Investor and their respective Affiliates.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter and the Guarantee, for and on behalf of
itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with _Section 9.10_
or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in
this _Section 9.10_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by applicable law, (b) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in
any action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom  



 

-63-  within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy
arises out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Guarantee or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the Commitment Letter, the
Guarantee, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (d)
agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), (e) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such
court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court
and agrees not to plead or claim the same and (f) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the
Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court
other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Newco, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as
provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF NEWCO, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTER, THE GUARANTEE OR THE
ACTIONS OF NEWCO, COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The parties hereto agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (ii) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
