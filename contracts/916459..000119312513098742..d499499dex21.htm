share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-
Entry Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_, the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

 

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 (d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split) or similar event, or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
_Section 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of
this Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company (the "Paying Agent"),
the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably acceptable
to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 3.1(b)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount
equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (the "Aggregate Merger
Consideration," and such Aggregate Merger Consideration as deposited with the
Paying Agent, the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_, Parent
shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii)
applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
pursuant to _Section 3.1_, except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement. 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the fifth Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall be in the
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify).

 



4 (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share within two (2) Business Days following the later to occur of
(i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required
by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred
and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon written demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor thereof for payment of
their claims for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_  that (i) no such investment
shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by
this _Article III_ , and following any losses Parent shall promptly

 



5  provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment
shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 

Section 3.3 _Company Options, Restricted Stock Units, Long-Term Cash Bonuses_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each vested and
unvested Company Option that is outstanding shall be canceled and shall
entitle the holder thereof to receive as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or
other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld)
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration, over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Option (the "Option Cash Payment"). Following
the Effective Time, any such canceled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable and shall only entitle the Company Option holder to the Option
Cash Payment, which shall be paid as of, or promptly following, the Effective
Time.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time,
any vesting conditions or restrictions applicable to each Company Restricted
Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior thereto shall lapse and the holder
thereof shall receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding
or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld)
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit and (ii) the Merger
Consideration (the "Restricted Stock Unit Payment"). Such Restricted Stock
Unit Payment shall be paid as of, or promptly following the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Treatment of Company Long-Term Cash Bonus Awards_. As of the Effective
Time, each Company Long-Term Cash Bonus Award shall be deemed to be earned on
a prorated basis (based on the portion of the applicable performance period
elapsed): (i) for Company Long-Term Cash Bonus Awards granted prior to May 1,
2012, at the payout opportunity that corresponds to the target performance
level originally established in respect of the applicable performance period
and (ii) for Company Long-Term Cash Bonus Awards granted on or after May 1,
2012, at the greater of (x) the payout opportunity that corresponds to the

 



6  actual performance level achieved by the Company in respect of such partial
performance period relative to the performance targets applicable to the
performance period in respect of which such Company Long-Term Cash Awards
were granted (as determined by the Companys Compensation Committee reasonably
and in good faith prior to the Effective Time, consistent with the amount
accrued by the Company in respect of such awards through such time in the
ordinary course of business consistent with its past practice) and (y) the
payout opportunity that corresponds to the target performance level for such
performance period, and shall in each case entitle the holder thereof to
receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other
Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to
such prorated portion of the Company Long-Term Cash Bonus Award (the "Long-
Term Cash Bonus Award Payment"). Such Long-Term Cash Bonus Award Payment
shall be paid as of, or promptly following, the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Long-Term Cash Bonus Awards granted
in respect of the 2011-2013 performance period (the "2011 LTCB Awards") shall
be deemed earned at the end of such performance period at the greater of (x)
the payout opportunity that corresponds to the actual performance level
achieved by the Company (and, for any portion of the performance period after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) in respect of such performance
period relative to the performance targets applicable to such performance
period (as determined following the end of such performance period by the
Companys Compensation Committee or, if such performance period ends after the
Effective Time, by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in all cases,
reasonably, in good faith, consistent with the amount accrued by the Company
and, if applicable, the Surviving Corporation in respect of such awards
through such time in the ordinary course of business consistent with the
Companys past practices) and (y) the payout opportunity that corresponds to
the target performance level for such performance period, provided that any
employee who is entitled to a 2011 LTCB Award and whose employment is
terminated at or after the Effective Time and prior to the end of the
performance period shall be paid a pro-rata portion (based on the portion of
the applicable performance period elapsed prior to the date of termination) of
such employees 2011 LTCB Award on the payment date in accordance with the
terms of the governing 2011 LTCB Award agreement (except that if such
termination is without Cause (as defined in the Company Executive Severance
Plan referenced in _Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_)), the
amount to be prorated shall be based on the amount provided for under
this Section 3.3(c), if greater. The 2011 LTCB Awards shall be paid as soon
as practicable following the end of such performance period in accordance with
the terms of the Company Long-Term Incentive Plan by the Company or, if
applicable, the Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Certain Actions_. The Company shall, at the request of Parent, reasonably
cooperate with Parent to obtain from all holders of Company Options an option
cancellation agreement, in a form to be mutually agreed upon by the Company
and Parent, in respect of the treatment of the Company Options as provided in
this  _Section 3.3_.

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



7 Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(b)_, to the
extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his
or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring
before, at or after the Effective Time), such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. Any payments required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares
shall be made by Parent (and not the Company or Acquisition Sub), and the
Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis,
as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the
Closing Date. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the
Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.
Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will comply with any
notice requirements applicable to a merger without a meeting of stockholders
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_, for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ , and, if applicable, any unclaimed dividends upon the
surrender of Certificates, shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



8 ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any disclosures set forth
under the headings "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" and any
other disclosures included in such Company SEC Documents to the extent they
are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) to the extent that
the applicable disclosure in such Company SEC Documents is such that its
relevance to a representation or warranty contained in this _Article IV_ it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure (it being agreed that
such disclosures shall not be exceptions to _Section 4.9(b)_) or (ii) subject
to _Section 9.3(b)_, as disclosed in the corresponding section of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or other entity
duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has the requisite entity power and authority to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be in
good standing or to have such power and authority would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated Bylaws, as currently in effect, are included in the Company SEC
Documents and the Company is not in violation of any provision of such
documents.

 

Section 4.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) As of February 27, 2013 (the "Capitalization Date"), the authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Company
Common Stock, 49,145,168 of which were issued and outstanding, and (ii)
10,000,000 shares of the Companys preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share,
no shares of which were outstanding. As of the date hereof, other than as set
forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no
existing and outstanding (i) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other
rights, convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any character to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party obligating the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity interest in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares
or equity interests (including any Company Options, Company Restricted Stock
Units, or dividend equivalent rights or phantom stock units denominated in
shares of Company Common Stock, whether settled in cash or shares of Company
Common Stock), (ii) contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) voting trusts or similar
agreements to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting of the
capital stock of the Company. Since the Capitalization Date, no shares of
capital stock of the Company, no capital stock or other equity interests of
any of the 

 



9  Companys Subsidiaries, and no other securities directly or indirectly
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, capital stock of the
Company, or capital stock or other equity interests of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, have been issued (including any dividend equivalent rights or
phantom stock units), other than shares of Company Common Stock issued upon
the exercise of Company Options or shares of Company Common Stock issued upon
the vesting of Company Restricted Stock Units outstanding as of the close of
business on the Capitalization Date. Each Company Option has been granted with
a per share exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option, in accordance with
Section 409A of the Code and published guidance thereunder.

(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or equivalent equity
interests of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are owned of record and
beneficially, directly or indirectly, by the Company or the relevant wholly-
owned Subsidiary (except for de minimis equity interests held by a Third Party
for local regulatory reasons) and free and clear of all Liens except for
ordinary restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable securities laws
and Permitted Liens. Each of the equity interests of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
(in each case, to the extent applicable) and not subject to preemptive or
similar rights.  _Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets
forth each Subsidiary of the Company with existing operations as of the date
hereof or otherwise required to be disclosed on the Companys Form 10-K filed
with the SEC on February 27, 2013, as if such form were filed on the date
hereof.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any interest or
investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other entity, other than a Subsidiary of the Company, except
for immaterial interests or investments.

 

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Companys Subsidiaries owns
any Company Common Stock.

(i) violate any provision of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or
Amended and Restated Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of any

its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound, or result in the creation of a Lien, other than any
Permitted Lien or any Lien created as a result of any action taken by Parent

of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) any
such conflict, violation, breach, default, termination, acceleration,
cancellation, loss of benefit or Lien that would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

approval, license, permit, order or authorization (a "Consent") of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental

of the Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

12 Section 4.6 _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2011, the Company has timely filed or furnished with
the SEC all material forms, documents and reports required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC, including all forms, documents and reports, the
failure of which to so file or furnish could reasonably be expected to result
in the loss of the Companys status as a "well known seasoned issuer" with
the SEC (such forms, documents, and reports filed with the SEC, including any
amendments thereto, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Benefit Plan" shall mean

at all times since inception has been, maintained, operated, administered and
funded in all respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with
all applicable requirements of all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules
and regulations, including, competent taxing authorities, notwithstanding that
the fair market value of the assets of the Title IV Plans is less than the
value of the liabilities thereunder (which underfunding alone does not
constitute failure to comply with this clause (ii)); (iii) the Company and
each other Person (including, without limitation, all fiduciaries) have,
at all times, properly performed all of their duties and obligations (whether
arising by operation of Law, by contract or otherwise) under or with respect

United Kingdom Pensions Regulator has not issued any financial support
direction or contribution notice against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (C) each Company Benefit Plan maintained in Germany has been
accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 715. (ii) With respect to each of
the Company Benefit Plans that is a defined benefit pension plan, the amounts
recorded in the books and records of the Company have been determined in
accordance with FASB ASC 715, based on the actuarial methods and assumptions

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent and Acquisition
Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized,
validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the
requisite company power and authority to conduct its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or to have
such power and authority would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company a copy of
the Parent Organizational Documents, as currently in effect, and neither
Parent nor Acquisition Sub is in violation of any provision of such
documents.

Section 5.2 _Authority Relative to Agreement_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub have all necessary company power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub, and the
consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
company action by Parent and Acquisition Sub, and no other action or
proceeding on the part of Parent and Acquisition Sub is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub and the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Acquisition Sub and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other
party hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Acquisition Sub, enforceable against Parent and Acquisition Sub in accordance
with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to

 



23  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally and (ii) the remedies of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

 

(b) The board of directors or similar governing body of each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub has, by resolutions duly adopted by the requisite vote of the
directors or similar governing members, (i) adopted this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests
of Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective stockholders or other
equityholders, as applicable. Parent, acting in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition Sub, has adopted this Agreement and the

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub nor the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the

its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents), (ii) assuming that the Consents, registrations,
declarations, filings and notices referred to in _Section 5.3_ have been
obtained or made, any applicable waiting periods referred to therein have
expired and any condition precedent to any such Consent has been satisfied,
conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
or give rise to any right of termination, acceleration or cancellation of, or
loss of any benefit under, any Contract to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound, or result in the creation of a Lien, other than any Permitted
Lien or any Lien created in connection with the Financing, upon any of the
material property or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than,
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflict, violation, breach,
default, termination, acceleration, cancellation, loss of benefit, or Lien
that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) No vote of, or consent by, the holders of any class or series of capital
stock of Parent is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise required by the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent, applicable Law (including any stockholder
approval provisions under the rules of any applicable securities exchange) or
any Governmental Authority.

 

Section 5.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. No Consent of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental

such other items

 



24  required solely by reason of the participation of the Company in the
transactions contemplated hereby, (v) compliance with and filings or
notifications under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws and (vi) such other
Consents, registrations, declarations, filings or notices the failure of which
to be obtained or made would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.4 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit,
action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment of any Governmental Authority
outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by
any Governmental Authority involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that
would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.5 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date hereof, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any contract, arrangement
or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized,
committed or agreed to enter into any contract, arrangement or understanding
(in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which: (a)
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of
a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to
which any stockholder of the Company (i) agrees to vote to adopt this
Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal
or (b) any Third Party has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity
capital (other than pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter) to Parent or the
Company to finance in whole or in part the Merger.

Section 5.6 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries expressly for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

 

Section 5.7 _Sufficient Funds_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(1) the executed commitment letters (including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto) from Barclays Bank PLC, Citi (as defined
below), Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands
Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., KKR Capital Markets LLC, KKR Corporate
Lending LLC, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Canada, RBC
Capital Markets, UBS Loan Finance LLC and UBS Securities LLC (collectively,
the "Debt Commitment Parties"), together with any related fee letters (except
that the fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms (none of which
would adversely affect the amount (other than up-front fees) or availability
of the Debt Financing) set forth therein have been redacted) and related term
sheets (collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Acquisition Sub or another
wholly owned Affiliate as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters for the
purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt
Financing"), and (2) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof (the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together 

 



25  with the Debt Commitment Letters, the "Financing Commitments") from KKR
North America Fund XI L.P. (the "Guarantor") pursuant to which the Guarantor
has committed to invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the
amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt
Financing, the "Financing"). " _Citi_ " shall mean Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., Citibank, N.A., Citicorp USA Inc., Citicorp North America, Inc. and/or
any of their affiliates as may be appropriate to provide the services
contemplated herein. The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue
to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof.

(b) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, each of the
Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent and
Acquisition Sub, the other parties thereto. There are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements (except for customary fee letters and
engagement letters) relating to the Financing Commitments. As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or
Acquisition Sub under any term, or a failure of any condition to the
obligations of the Financing Sources, in the Financing Commitments or to the
knowledge of Parent or Acquisition Sub otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the date hereof, and
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_
relating to the Companys obligations under _Section 6.12_ and the completion
of the Marketing Period and, subject to the "Funding Conditions
Provisions" (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letters), the "Company
Representations" and the "Specified Representations" (each such term as
defined in the Debt Commitment Letters) being true and correct in all material
respects, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has reason to believe that it
could reasonably be expected to be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of the Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it.
Parent or Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing when funded
in accordance with the Financing Commitments are sufficient to fund all of
the amounts required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of
all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations under this Agreement,
including the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and any amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 3.3_, and the payment of all associated costs
and Expenses of the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing
of indebtedness of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company required in
connection therewith). There are no conditions precedent related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments.

(c) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is aware of any direct or
indirect limitation or other restriction on the ability of the lender parties
in the Debt Financing to provide financing for other potential purchasers of
the Company.

Section 5.8 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Guaranty of the Guarantor, dated as
of the date hereof. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a valid
and binding obligation of the

 



26  Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms
(subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights
generally and general principles of equity) and no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default on
the part of the Guarantor under such Guaranty.

 

Section 5.9 _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 1,000
shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Acquisition Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby,
and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and
prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.10 _Interest in Competitors_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and Guarantor
do not own any interest in any entity or Person that derives a substantial
portion of its revenues from products, services or lines of business within
the Companys principal products, services or lines of business.

Section 5.11 _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such
term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have
not been registered under the Securities Act or any Blue Sky Laws and cannot
be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, any
applicable Blue Sky Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such
registration.

Section 5.12 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, investment banker, consultant or
intermediary is entitled to any investment banking, brokerage, finders or
similar fee or commission from the Company prior to the Closing in connection
with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries.

Section 5.13 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Guarantor is
entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, Parents and
Acquisition Subs sole asset is cash in a _de minimis_ amount (less than
$1,000) and its sole liabilities are those incidental to its formation or
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming (i) that
the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time (and for the
avoidance of doubt, before giving effect to the incurrence of the Debt
Financing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Debt Financing), (ii) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations to consummate the Merger as set
forth herein, or the waiver of such conditions, (iii) the reasonableness of
any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and that such estimates, projections or forecasts have been prepared in good
faith

 



27  based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable and (iv) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Article IV_ and any certificate delivered hereunder in all material respects
(but without giving effect to any knowledge, materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect qualification or exception contained therein), at the Effective
Time each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect
to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and any amounts payable pursuant to  _Section 3.3_, the
payment of all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
payment of all related fees and Expenses, be Solvent at and immediately after
the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 5.13_, the term "Solvent" means,
with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the
assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, after the
Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed
their debts, (b) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, after the Merger,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries have not incurred
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (c) each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries has sufficient capital and liquidity with
which to conduct its business. For purposes of this _Section 5.13_, "debt"
means any liability on a claim, and "claim" means any (a) right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (b) any right to an equitable
remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a payment,
whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or
unsecured.

 

Section 5.14 _Share Ownership_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of
their Affiliates has been, at any time during the three (3) years preceding
the date hereof, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their respective controlled Affiliates owns (directly or
indirectly, beneficially or of record) any Company Common Stock and none of
Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective controlled Affiliates holds any
rights to acquire any Company Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 5.15 _WARN Act_. Parent and Acquisition Sub are neither planning nor
contemplating, and Parent and Acquisition Sub have neither made nor taken,
any decisions or actions concerning the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time that would require, prior to the signing
of this Agreement or the Effective Time, as may be applicable, (a) the
service of notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
or any local, state or foreign Laws that would require advance notice of any
such actions to employees, labor unions, works councils or Governmental
Authorities (collectively, the "WARN Act") or (b) notice to or consultation to
any labor union, works council or similar employee organization.

Section 5.16 _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or
obligations or understandings between Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management
or the board of directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company
after the Effective Time.

 



28 Section 5.17 _Acknowledgment of Disclaimer of Other Representations
and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that, as of
the date hereof, they and their Representatives (a) have received reasonable
access to (i) such books and records, facilities, properties, premises,
equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
which they and their Representatives, as of the date hereof, have requested to
review and (ii) the electronic and physical data rooms in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby and (b) have had reasonable opportunity to
meet with the management of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to discuss
the business and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent and
Acquisition Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and any
certificate delivered hereunder, (a) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to
itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger and Parent
and Acquisition Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty except
for those expressly set forth in _Article IV_ , (b) no Person has
been authorized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in
connection with the Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must
not be relied upon by Parent or Acquisition Sub as having been authorized by
such entity and (c) any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial
information, memorandum, presentation or any other materials or information
provided or addressed to Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their
Representatives, including any materials or information made available in the
electronic and physical data rooms in connection with the transaction, via
confidential information memorandum, in connection with presentations by
the Companys management or otherwise, are not and shall not be deemed to be
or include representations or warranties unless and to the extent any such
materials or information is the subject of any express representation or
warranty set forth in  _Article IV_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub has
conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent review and analysis of the
businesses, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the
Financing, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub has relied on the results of its
own independent review and analysis and the covenants, representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement.

32 Section 6.2 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_. 

(a) Subject to Parents timely performance of its obligations under _Section
6.2(b)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and
shall cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form the Proxy Statement
within twenty-five (25) Business Days of the date hereof and in any event as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent and Acquisition Sub upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall
provide Parent and Acquisition Sub promptly with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or
the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, (ii)
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as soon as reasonably
practicable after such filing and (iii) cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable thereafter.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response,
unless, in each case, as required by Law. 

(b) Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Acquisition Sub and any arrangements Parent or any of its Affiliates have
with any former executive officer of the Company with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder and to satisfy all rules of the
New York Stock Exchange to be set forth in the Proxy Statement promptly
following request therefor from the Company and shall otherwise assist and
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
resolution of comments of the SEC or its staff related thereto. Parent will
cause the information relating to Parent or Acquisition Sub or any
arrangements Parent or any of its Affiliates have with any former executive
officer of the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
supplied by it and the Company will cause the information supplied by it, in
each case, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of
the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time
of the Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) In accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Restated
Bylaws of the Company and applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable, (i) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of
its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this
Agreement and holding the Company Stockholder Advisory Vote (the
"Stockholders Meeting") and (ii) duly call, convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
circumstance relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or
their respective officers or directors should be discovered by the Company
which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in
an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall inform
Parent as soon as reasonably practicable. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and
the Company agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Proxy Statement which shall have 

 



33  become false or misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all
documents that such party is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the Merger to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, not to contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. Subject to the ability of the board of
directors of the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 6.5_, the board of directors of the Company shall
make the Company Recommendation with respect to the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock held by
them in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.5_), the parties hereto will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, including using reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or non-actions, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities
or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, performed or consummated by such party in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger and any
other transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly (and in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date that this Agreement is
executed) make and not withdraw (without the Companys consent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) its respective
filings under the HSR Act, and thereafter make any other applications and
filings as reasonably determined by Company and Parent under applicable
Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the jurisdictions referred to in _Section 7.1(b)_), including the Merger, as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than as required by Law.

 



34 (b) The Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to use reasonable best
efforts to take (and to cause their controlled Affiliates to take) promptly
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
and obtain all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any
foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case
with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, as promptly
as practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such assets
or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as are required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any Order, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.
Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, but subject to and limited by the
preceding sentence, the Company and Parent will take any and all actions
reasonably necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-
action by or Consent or approval of the Antitrust Division or other foreign
or U.S. Governmental Authority with respect to any Antitrust Laws, (y) no
decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other Order
in any suit or proceeding with respect to any Antitrust Laws, and (z) no
other matter relating to any Antitrust Laws would preclude consummation of the
Merger by the Termination Date.

(c) The Company shall give (or shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to
give) any notices to Third Parties, and Parent shall use, and cause each of
its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts, to cooperate with the
Company in its efforts to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by
paragraphs (a) and (b) above that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing the
other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications
between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any Third Party consents
pursuant to this _Section 6.3(c)_ shall not be considered a condition to the
obligations of the Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger.

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the
representatives, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys,
accountants and financial advisors ("Representatives") of Parent reasonable
access, in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the operations
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to the properties, books and records and executive management teams (and
other employees to whom Parent reasonably requests access) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Representatives all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ __, _however_ , that
nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose any information to Parent or Acquisition Sub if such disclosure

 



35  would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) cause significant
competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (ii) violate applicable
Law or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or (iii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege, provided that the parties will attempt in good faith to make such
alternative arrangements as may be reasonably necessary so that the
restrictions of the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii) would not apply; _provided_
_further_ , that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives
to undertake any environmental testing involving sampling of soil,
groundwater, or similar invasive techniques at any of the properties owned,
operated or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries. No investigation or
access permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder. Parent
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ for any competitive or
other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (which transactions, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include the Financing). The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with
respect to information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Companys officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder.

 

Section 6.5 _Competing Proposals_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.5_, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and its Subsidiaries will
not, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
officers, directors, employees and other Representatives not to, (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate, directly or indirectly, the
making of any Competing Proposal or (ii) engage in negotiations or substantive
discussions with (it being understood that the Company may inform Persons of
the provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_), or furnish any nonpublic
information to, any Person relating to a Competing Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Competing Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably
be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in connection
therewith and immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
from the date of this Agreement and prior to the date that the Requisite
Stockholder Approval is obtained at the Stockholders Meeting, in the event
that the Company receives a written Competing Proposal, the Company and its
board of directors may engage in negotiations or substantive discussions
with, or furnish any information and other access to, any Person making such
Competing Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing
if the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that
such Competing Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that (x) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information,
the Company receives from such Person, to the extent such Person is not
already subject to a

 



36  confidentiality agreement with the Company, an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms that are not materially less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not restrict
the making of Competing Proposals (and related communications) to the Company
or the Companys board of directors) and (y) any such nonpublic information
so furnished in writing has been previously provided to Parent or is provided
to Parent substantially concurrently with it being so furnished to such Person
or its Representatives. Prior to or substantially concurrently with taking
any of the actions referred to in this _Section 6.5(b)_, the Company shall
notify Parent that it proposes to furnish and thereafter make available to
Parent any nonpublic information and promptly notify Parent if it has
entered or intends to enter into discussions or negotiations as provided in
this _Section 6.5(b)_.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the board of directors of
the Company (or any committee thereof) shall not (i) (A) withdraw or modify,
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, the Company Recommendation or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Competing
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an
"Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or allow the
Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding or definitive merger or similar agreement
with respect to any Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 6.5(b)_). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, (i) the board of directors of the Company may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change if the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its counsel and financial
advisors) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law and (ii) the board of directors of the
Company may enter into a binding written agreement substantially concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ in order to enter into a transaction that the board of directors
of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made and (2) no
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.5(c)_ and 
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ may be effected, in each case unless (A) Parent has
received a written notice from the Company advising Parent that the board of
directors of the Company intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
(a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 6.5(c)_ and _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if the basis of
the proposed action by the Companys board of directors is a Superior
Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, (B) during
the five (5) Business Day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal or Notice of Adverse Recommendation, as applicable, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments and/or the Guaranty so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal and/or so that the failure to take make an
Adverse Recommendation Change would not be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law and (C) following the end of the five (5)
Business Day period, the board of directors of the Company shall have

 



37  determined in good faith after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments and/or the Guaranty proposed in writing by Parent and Acquisition
Sub in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or Notice of Adverse
Recommendation or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
and/or that the failure to take make an Adverse Recommendation Change would
still be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. Any
material amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 6.5(c)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the five (5)
Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a three (3)
Business Day period. Subject to the foregoing, in determining whether to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or in determining whether a Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the
Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
timely proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation,
a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise.

(d) The Company shall promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business
Days, advise Parent of any Competing Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
the identity of the Person making any such Competing Proposal. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status and material details (including any material change to the terms
thereof) of any such Competing Proposal and any discussions and negotiations
concerning the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company hereby
agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into
any agreement that prohibits or restricts it from providing to Parent the
information contemplated by this _Section 6.5(d)_ or complying with _Section
6.5(c)_.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Company from taking or
disclosing a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to comply with applicable Law
(it being agreed that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of
directors to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that
describes the Companys receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change or give rise to a Parent termination right pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_).

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer made by any Person
(other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Affiliate thereof) or group of
Persons to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, (i) beneficial ownership (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock,
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction or (ii) any one or more
assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that constitute
twenty percent (20%) or more of the revenues or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



38 (ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing Proposal (with
all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty
percent (50%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the board of
directors of the Company considers to be appropriate, are more favorable to
the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after having complied with
_Section 6.5(c)_ and after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms
thereof which may be offered by Parent in writing (including pursuant to
_Section 6.5(c)_).

 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby), now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers and employees, if any ("DandO Indemnified Parties"), as the
case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective organizational documents or in any Contract as in effect on the
date hereof. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance
expenses to DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent that the Company or
its Subsidiaries would be permitted by applicable Law and to the
fullest extent required by the organizational documents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Parent shall cause
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of
director, officer and employee liability that are no less favorable to the DandO
Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the Companys and its
Subsidiaries organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not, for a period of six years from the Effective
Time, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnified Parties.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of  _Section 6.6(a)_, to the fullest
extent that the Company would be permitted by applicable Law to do so, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
DandO Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any alleged
action or omission in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time or (B) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such 

 



39  claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) of any DandO Indemnified Party upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such DandO Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified by applicable Law. Any determination required
to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any DandO Indemnified Party
complies or complied with any applicable standard shall be made by independent
legal counsel selected by the DandO Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and the fees of such
counsel shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, unless such settlement, compromise, consent
or termination includes an unconditional release of all of the DandO
Indemnified Parties covered by the claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

 

(c) Unless the Company shall have purchased a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time as provided below, for at least six (6) years after the
Effective Time, (i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other
Subsidiaries to maintain in full force and effect, on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified Parties, or any other Person
entitled to the benefit of this _Section 6.6_, as applicable, than the
existing directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement, covering claims
arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ ,
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by the
Company on an annualized basis, but in such case shall purchase as much of
such coverage as possible for such amount) and (ii) Parent shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its other Subsidiaries to, take
any action that would prejudice the rights of, or otherwise impede recovery
by, the beneficiaries of any such insurance, whether in respect of claims
arising before or after the Effective Time. In lieu of such insurance, prior
to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid
policy on such terms and conditions ( _provided_ , that the premium for such
insurance shall not exceed six hundred percent (600%) of the aggregate annual
premiums currently paid by the Company on an annualized basis), in which event
Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this
_Section 6.6(c)_.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.6_. 

(e) The DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each DandO Indemnified
Party and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. 

 



40  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party
in enforcing its indemnity and other rights under this _Section 6.6_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely (or any earlier
period actually specified in this  _Section 6.6_) and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and shall be enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties
and their successors, heirs or representatives. 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and (b) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
shall cooperate with Parent in the defense and settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise contemplated by
_Section 6.5_, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and none of the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such
press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other
parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange rule or
any listing agreement of any party hereto. In addition, the Company may,
without Parent or Acquisition Subs consent, communicate to its employees,
customers, suppliers and consultants provided that such communication is made
privately (i.e., not as a public statement) and is consistent with a
communications plan previously agreed to by Parent and the Company in which
case such communications may be made consistent with such plan. 

Section 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) All employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall continue to be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Continuing
Employees"). During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
December 31, 2014, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to:
(i) provide to each Continuing Employee for so long as he or she remains an
employee of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates with an annual
rate of base salary or wages, as applicable, and an annual cash-based
incentive compensation target amount opportunity (excluding any long-term cash
and equity-based incentive compensation

 



41  opportunities) that are no less favorable than the annual rate of base
salary or wages, as applicable, and the annual cash-based incentive
compensation target amount opportunity (excluding any long-term cash and
equity-based incentive compensation opportunities) provided to each such
employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Continuing Employees for so long as
they remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates
with employee benefits (excluding any employee benefits that are frozen,
discontinued or, as of the Effective Time, being frozen or discontinued) that,
in the aggregate, are no less favorable in the aggregate, than the employee
benefits (excluding any employee benefits that are frozen, discontinued or, as
of the Effective Time, being frozen or discontinued) provided to such
employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Parent agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Surviving Corporations employee benefit plans established following the
Closing Date (if any) and any other employee benefit plans covering the
Continuing Employees following the Effective Time (collectively, the "Post-
Closing Plans"), to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the
extent such service was recognized by the Company) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits (but not for
benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit pension plan) under the
Post-Closing Plans, to the extent such recognition does not result in the
duplication of any benefits.

(c) For the calendar year including the Effective Time, the Continuing
Employees shall not be required to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-
pocket maximum or similar requirements under the Post-Closing Plans that
provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits (collectively, the "Post-
Closing Welfare Plans") to the extent amounts were previously credited for
such purposes under comparable Company Benefit Plans that provide medical,
dental and other welfare benefits.

(d) For the calendar year including the Effective Time, any waiting periods,
pre-existing condition exclusions and requirements to show evidence of good
health contained in such Post-Closing Welfare Plans shall be waived with
respect to the Continuing Employees (except to the extent any such waiting
period, pre-existing condition exclusion, or requirement of show evidence of
good health was already in effect with respect to such employees and that have
not been satisfied under the applicable Company Benefit Plan in which the
participant then participates or is otherwise eligible to participate as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(e) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide severance payments and benefits to
each Continuing Employee (other than those Continuing Employees who otherwise
have rights under any Executive Change in Control Agreement referenced in
_Section 6.9(f)_ below) whose employment is terminated, on or before the
second (2nd) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, under
circumstances that would otherwise give rise to rights to severance payments
and benefits under the terms and conditions of the Company Benefit Plans set
forth in _Section 6.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (but disregarding
any expiration date provided for in any such Company Benefit Plan) and that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those that would have been paid or
provided for pursuant to such plans.

 



42 (f) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, honor in accordance with their terms, all Company Benefit Plans set forth
in _Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_. Effective as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to assume and agree to honor the Companys obligations under
the Executive Change in Control Agreements listed on _Section 4.12(h) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_ (the "Executive Change in Control Agreements").
Parent and the Company hereby agree that (i) such assumption satisfies the
successor obligations contained in clause (v) of each such Executive Change in
Control Agreement and (ii) the occurrence of the Effective Time shall
constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of the Executive Change in
Control Agreements and all other Company Benefit Plans in which the term is
relevant listed in  _Section 4.12(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter_.

(g) Parent acknowledges that, under the Company Executive Annual Bonus Plan
listed in _Section 4.12(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, immediately
upon the Effective Time, the Company shall pay a pro-rata portion of the
annual cash bonuses to those then current employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who are at such time eligible to receive such pro-rata bonus
amount in respect of the Companys fiscal year in which the Effective Time
occurs, with such pro-rata bonuses to be calculated at the target performance
level, all in accordance with the terms of such plan.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor the
terms of all works council, labor and collective bargaining agreements to or
by which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or are bound that are in
effect as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof. At all
times prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, comply in all respects with all notice, consultation and
similar provisions of all works council, labor and collective bargaining
agreements to or by which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or are
bound in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_ to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, Post-Closing
Plan, or any other employee benefit plans of the Company or Parent or as a
guarantee of employment for any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.

 

Section 6.10 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Acquisition Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date
hereof and the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Parent and Acquisition Sub:

(a) shall not amend or otherwise change any of the Parent Organizational
Documents, except as may be agreed in writing by the Company and except for
any amendments or changes as would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
delay or impair the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



43 (b) subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
their respective reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are required
pursuant to _Section 6.11_ such that, as of the Closing, Parent and
Acquisition Sub will satisfy all of the conditions that are within their
control contained in the Financing Commitments necessary to secure the
Financing;

 

(c) shall not, and shall not cause any of their Affiliates to, and the
Guarantor shall not acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating
with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or
by any other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization
or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets
if such business competes in any line of business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or
the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to (i) materially impose any delay in the obtaining
of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization,
consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such Order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(d) shall not, and shall not cause any of their Affiliates to, take or agree
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Financing; and

(e) shall not, and shall not cause any of their Affiliates to, prior to the
Termination Date, enter or agree to enter into any definitive agreement for
the acquisition of any business or Person or take or agree to take any other
action which, in either case, would reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with their ability to make available to the Paying Agent immediately
prior to the Effective Time funds sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations under this Agreement, including
the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 3.3_, and the payment of all associated costs and
Expenses (including any refinancing of indebtedness of Parent or the Company
required in connection therewith) or otherwise would be reasonably expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.11 _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives shall not incur any liability to any Person under any
financing that Parent and Acquisition Sub may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided
pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ or _Section 6.12_ and that Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs

 



44  or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, except with
respect to any information provided by the Company and its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives.

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to, take or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Financing Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts to:
(i) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, but in no event later than the Closing, or on such
other terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and
Acquisition Sub than the terms and conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments (provided that such other terms would not reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent the Closing), (ii) satisfy, or cause their Representatives
to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Acquisition
Sub or their respective Representatives in the Debt Commitment Letters (or
definitive agreements entered into with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letters), (iii) accepting to the fullest extent all "market-flex" contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters (including the fee letter relating thereto),
(iv) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters in the event of a
breach by the Financing Sources that impedes or delays the Closing and, if
necessary, seeking specific performance of the Financing Sources of their
obligations thereunder and (iv) in the event that all conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letters have been satisfied (or would be satisfied upon funding of
the Equity Financing) cause the lenders and any other Persons providing
Financing to fund the Financing at the Closing.

(c) Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Financing Commitments without the prior written consent of the
Company, except that Parent and its Affiliates may amend or otherwise modify
(or waive any of its rights under) the Commitment Letters (including to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof (which
shall not be subject to any limitations or qualifiers)) if such amendment,
modification or waiver would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment, modification or waiver shall be permitted without the
Companys prior written approval if such amendments, modifications or waivers
would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt
Financing) below the amount required to consummate the Merger (including the
amount required for the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and
any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.3_ and all associated costs and
Expenses (including any refinancing of indebtedness of Parent or the Company
required in connection therewith)), (ii) impose new or additional conditions
or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments. Parent
shall not release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the
lenders under the Debt Commitment Letters, except for assignments and
replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in connection with
the syndication of the Debt Commitment Letters. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall the reasonable best efforts

 



45  obligation set forth in this _Section 6.11_ be construed as to require
Parent to agree to, or accept, economic terms that are materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent or Acquisition Sub than the economic
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (assuming application of the
"market flex" provisions) or otherwise pay any fees to the lenders which fees
are more than de minimus amounts and are in excess of those contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letters and related fee letters, including the "flex"
provisions thereof, as of the date hereof.

(d) After the date of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Acquisition
Sub or any of their controlled Affiliates (which for purposes of this _Section
6.11(d)_ shall be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or
Acquisition Sub or other Representatives, or any of Parents, Acquisition
Subs or such investors financing sources or potential financing sources or
other Representatives) (i) award any agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other firm or Person, except for any Affiliate of Parent,
any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis that would prohibit the
provision of such financial advisory services to another Person in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) prohibit
or seek to prohibit any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of
debt or equity financing, including the Debt Commitment Parties,
from providing or seeking to provide financing or financial advisory services
to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the Company hereby agrees that
Parent and its Affiliates may provide Evaluation Material (as such term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to, or enter into discussions,
agreements, arrangements or understandings with, potential sources of debt or
equity financing with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and such potential sources of debt or
equity financing shall be deemed a "Representative" (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) thereunder; provided that the Affiliate of Parent
that is a counterparty to the Confidentiality Agreement shall be responsible
for any breach of the Confidentiality Agreement by any potential sources of
debt or equity financing or its officers, directors, employees or other
representatives with whom the Evaluation Material is shared, except to the
extent such potential sources of debt or equity financing have agreed in a
writing addressed to the Company, in the form of Exhibit A to the
Confidentiality Agreement, to be bound by the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement applicable to Representatives. In the event that any
portion of the Financing becomes or could reasonably be expected to become
unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing
Commitments, (i) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon terms and conditions not less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Acquisition Sub than those in the
Financing Commitments, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event (and, in any event, no later than the expiration of the Marketing
Period); it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Guarantor be required to provide financing in excess of the amount
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and in no event shall Parent or
Acquisition Sub be required to seek or obtain equity financing other than the
Equity Financing. The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to this 
_Section 6.11(d)_ or _Section 6.11(b)(i)_ are referred to in this Agreement,
collectively, as the "Financing Agreements."

 



46 (e) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing, nor the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing or any
alternative financing, is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative financing, or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.2_.

(f) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement promptly
upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach or threatened material breach by any party of any of the Financing
Commitments, any alternative financing commitment, the Financing Agreements,
or any alternative financing agreement of which Parent or Acquisition Sub
becomes aware or any termination or threatened termination thereof of which
Parent or Acquisition Sub becomes aware, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company
reasonably and promptly informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (or any alternative financing), including by providing the Company
with drafts of the definitive agreements or offering memoranda relating to
the Financing a reasonable period of time prior to their execution or use.

Section 6.12  _Financing Cooperation_. Subject to _Section 6.11(a)_, the
Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective Representatives to, in each
case at Parents sole expense, reasonably cooperate in connection with the
arrangement and closing of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries).
Such cooperation by the Company shall include, at the reasonable request of
Parent, (i) furnishing, or causing to be furnished to, Parent and its
Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable following Parents
written request, such financial and other information as Parent shall
reasonably request in order to consummate the Debt Financing, including (y)
the financial statements and other information necessary to satisfy the
conditions set forth in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the Debt Commitment Letters;
_provided_ , that, in the case of quarterly or annual financial statements
required pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ that have not been delivered to
Parent prior to the date hereof, by a date that is not later than 45 days
after the end of the relevant fiscal quarter, with respect to the unaudited
quarterly financial statements required pursuant to this _Section 6.12_, or,
90 days after the end of the relevant fiscal year in respect of the annual
financial statements required pursuant to this _Section 6.12_, as applicable,
and (z) all financial statements and financial data of the type required in
registration statements on Form S-1 by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act and of a type and form customarily included in
private placements pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, including,
to the extent applicable with respect to such financial statements, the
report of the Companys auditors thereon and related management discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in each case with
customary exceptions for a Rule 144A offering, together with drafts
of comfort letters customary for private placements under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act by auditors of the Company which such auditors are prepared to
issue at the time of pricing of such debt securities and the closing thereof
upon completion of customary procedures (collectively, the "Required
Information," provided that in no event shall the Required Information be
deemed to include or

 



47  shall the Company otherwise be required to provide (A) such pro forma
statements or pro forma adjustments unless Parent has provided to the Company
(a) any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, capitalization and other
post-Closing or pro forma adjustments (and the assumptions relating thereto)
desired by the Parent to be reflected in such pro forma and summary financial
data and (b) any other information that may be reasonably and timely
requested by the Company concerning the assumptions underlying the post-
Closing or pro forma adjustments to be made in such pro forma and summary
financial data, which assumptions shall be the responsibility of Parent, (B)
any description of all or any component of the Financing, including any
"description of notes," (C) risk factors relating to all or any component of
the Financing or (D) Subsidiary financial statements or any other information
of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 (other than a customary summary
of such information) or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (E) Compensation
Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or (F) except
to the extent customarily included in private placements pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act, information required by Items 10-14 of Form 10-K,
(ii) causing the Companys and its Subsidiaries management teams, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, to participate in a reasonable number of
meetings, lender presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions,
road shows and meetings with prospective lenders and ratings agencies, in each
case, upon reasonable advance notice and at mutually agreed times, (iii)
providing reasonable assistance to Parent in its preparation of rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda and offering documents (including a
bank information memorandum that does not include material non-public
information), offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and similar
documents required in connection with the Financing (including requesting any
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation
letters), (iv) facilitating the pledging of collateral in connection with the
Financing, including, executing and delivering any customary pledge and
security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements or other
customary definitive financing documents, surveys and title insurance
(including non-imputation title policy endorsements and affidavits reasonably
required by the title company), and documents as may be reasonably requested
by Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the
Company (who is or will be such officer as of the Effective Time) with respect
to solvency matters in the term set forth in Annex I to Exhibit D of the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the Closing, on a pro forma basis) as are, in the
good faith determination of the persons executing such documents, accurate, or
otherwise facilitating the pledging, granting of security interests in, and
otherwise granting of liens on, the Companys assets, pursuant to such
agreements from and after the Closing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, provided, that none of the documentation described in this clause
(iv) shall be effective until the Effective Time, (v) causing the taking of
corporate actions (subject to the occurrence of the Closing) by the Company
and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the completion of

the Closing, providing all documentation and other information about the
Company as is reasonably requested by the Financing Sources with respect to
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act. The Company
hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are used in a
manner that is not intended to harm or disparage the Company or their marks
and on such other customary terms and conditions as the Company shall
reasonably impose. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, clauses
(i)-(x) above shall not (A) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
be the issuer of any securities or issue any offering or information document
or before the Closing, (B) involve any binding commitment by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which commitment is not conditioned on the
Closing and does not terminate without liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement or (C) require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any Financing or purchase
agreement for the Financing, provided that, upon the reasonable request of
Parent, the Companys Subsidiaries may approve any Financing so long as such
approval is expressly conditioned on the Closing and does not impose any
liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries upon termination of this
Agreement. All non-public or other confidential information provided by the
Company to Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to rating agencies
and prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or syndication of the equity
financing, subject to ordinary and customary confidentiality undertakings
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and costs incurred in connection with the Companys or
its Affiliates obligations under this _Section 6.12_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing)
prior to the Effective Time, or pay any expenses prior to the Effective Time
that are not promptly reimbursed by Parent as set forth in this _Section
6.12_, (ii) no officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action
pursuant to this  _Section 6.12_ to the extent any such action would
reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer, and
(iii) the board of directors of the Company shall not be required to approve
any Financing or agreements related thereto (or any alternative financing)
prior to the Effective Time. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their
reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Information
provided to Parent as may be reasonably necessary so that such Required
Information (i) meets the condition set forth in the first proviso in the
definition of "Marketing Period", (ii) meets the applicable requirements set
forth in the definition of "Required Information," and (iii) would not, after
giving effect to such update(s), result in the Marketing Period to cease to be
deemed to have commenced.

Section 6.13 _Repayment of Indebtedness_. In connection with and conditioned
upon the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to) provide
and make available to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount
equal to (i) the amount necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to
repay and discharge in full all amounts outstanding or otherwise due and owing
pursuant to the terms of the financing arrangements set forth on _Section
6.13 of_

 



49   __ _the Company Disclosure Letter_ (the "Company Debt"), including accrued
interest thereon and all fees and other obligations (including penalties or
other charges or amounts that become payable thereunder as a result of the
prepayment thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated at
the Closing or that may become due and payable at the Effective Time) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder (collectively, the "Debt Payoff
Amount") _less_ (ii) any cash on hand of the Company and its Subsidiaries at
Closing that is reasonably available to the Company. At the request of Parent,
the Company shall take such steps as are reasonably necessary to transfer any
cash held by Subsidiaries of the Company to the Company such that such cash is
available to contribute to the payment of the Debt Payoff Amount on the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this
_Section 6.13_ shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in Tax obligations or
other significant costs or expenses to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
being incurred prior to the date that the Closing Date is established pursuant
to _Section 2.2_. The Company shall deliver on or prior to the Closing,
copies of payoff letters in connection with the Company Debt, which payoff
letters shall substantially provide (subject to customary exceptions) (i) that
upon receipt of the Debt Payoff Amount, the Company Debt and related
instruments shall be terminated and (ii) that all Liens (and guarantees)
in connection therewith relating to the assets and properties of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries securing such obligations shall be, upon the
payment of the Debt Payoff Amount, released and terminated.

 

Section 6.14 _Acquisition Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall not
conduct any business, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness or make any
investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.15 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries operations.

 

Section 6.16 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may take such further actions, if any, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including any derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company
who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.17 _FIRPTA Certificate_. In connection with the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a duly executed certificate of the Company, dated as
of the Closing Date, in form and substance acceptable to Parent and in
compliance with the Code and Treasury Regulations, certifying that the shares
of Company Common Stock are not United States real property interests (as
defined in Section 897(c)(1)(A) of the Code), in accordance with Section 1445
of the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.897-2(h).

 



50 Section 6.18 _Connecticut Property Transfer Law_. Within fourteen (14)
Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall make a
determination as to whether, as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, it believes the Connecticut Facility is subject to the
Transfer Law and shall present this conclusion to Parent. If either the
Parent or the Company believes that the Transfer Law applies to the
Connecticut Facility, then:

(a) the Company shall cause the Connecticut Subsidiary to retain a LEP,
subject to Parents consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The LEP shall prepare an Environmental Condition
Assessment Form (as such term is defined by the Transfer Law) and shall
determine, in compliance with the Transfer Law, whether a Form I, Form II,
Form III or Form IV (as such terms are defined by the Transfer Law) shall
be prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall provide drafts of all such documents to the parties for
review of the parties and the parties approval, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Connecticut Subsidiary shall certify
the Form and the Environmental Conditions Assessment Form and the parties
shall identify and cause an appropriate Person to execute these documents, as
required by the Transfer Law;

 

(b) the Company shall cause the Connecticut Subsidiary to provide a copy of
(i) the Environmental Conditions Assessment, (ii) Form I, II, III, or IV and
(iii) any other required documentation to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing
Date; and

(c) the Connecticut Subsidiary shall comply with the obligations of the
Transfer Law after the Closing, including filing all required documentation
with the CDEEP and paying all filing fees.

 

Section 6.19 _Restructuring Matters_. The Company shall provide Parent and its
Representatives from time to time a reasonable opportunity to review and
evaluate the Companys European restructuring plan (including as such plan has
been disclosed in the Company SEC Documents prior to the date of this
Agreement, the "Restructuring Plan"), including by allowing Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive in any material
respect to the operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
to members of Company management responsible for, or significantly
involved in, the formulation and execution of the Restructuring Plan and all
production facilities that are the subject of, or may reasonably be expected
to be directly affected by, the Restructuring Plan and furnishing as promptly
as practicable to Parent and its Representatives all material reports and
documents (whether prepared by the Company or outside parties engaged by or on
behalf of the Company, in each case, subject to any applicable attorney-client
or other legal privilege) that are prepared primarily in connection with the
Restructuring Plan. Subject to applicable law, the Company agrees to adopt and
implement any alternative plan or amendments to the Restructuring Plan, in
each case, that may be proposed in writing and in reasonable detail by Parent
to the Company if in the good faith, reasonable judgment of the board of
directors of the Company such alternative plan or amendments would not
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk profile of
the Restructuring Plan to the Company or negatively impact the stockholders
of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event will the Company take any action without the prior written consent of
Parent between the date of this Agreement and the date that is six weeks from
the date of this Agreement, including any consultations or other
communications with any Governmental Authority or works council

  



51  unless required by applicable Law, that would (i) reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay or impede the implementation of any alternative
plan or any material amendments to the Restructuring Plan that may be
proposed by Parent (in each case that has been previously provided in writing
and in reasonable detail to the Company by Parent) or (ii) otherwise
reasonably be expected to result in significant costs to reverse or cease
such action.

months from signing (which shall then be the "Termination Date"); _provided
further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party if the failure of

Closing to have occurred on or before such date; _provided further_ that
neither party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ if (x) all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been

obligations under this Agreement; or

 

(iii) the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby have been voted upon; or

(c) by the Company:

(i) if Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any
of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give
rise to the failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 7.3(a)_ or
_Section 7.3(b)_ and (y) is not capable of being cured, or is not cured, by
Parent or Acquisition Sub on or before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date

delivery of written notice to Parent or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, of
such breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have the

subject to the applicable terms and conditions of, _Section 6.5_, and
concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination, the Company pays
to Parent the fee specified in _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_;

 

(iii) if (a) all the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to

are then capable of being satisfied), (b) Parent shall have failed to
consummate the Merger by the time the Closing should have occurred pursuant
to _Section 2.2_, (c) the Company has notified Parent in writing that all of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or, with respect

Closing were to occur on the date of such notice) and it stands and will stand
ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger at such time and (d) the
Company shall have given Parent written notice at least one (1) Business Day
prior to such termination stating the Companys intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ and the basis for such
termination; or

 

(d) by Parent:

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_,
and (ii) is not capable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company on or
before the earlier of (A) the Termination Date and (B) the date that is

Company of such breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

 

(ii) if the board of directors of the Company (A) shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change or publicly proposes to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, (B) fails to include in the Proxy Statement when mailed, the Company
Recommendation, (C) approves or recommends any Competing Proposal, or fails to
recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer for any
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes a
Competing Proposal, including, for these purposes, by taking no position with
respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by
its stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer, within ten (10) Business
Days after commencement; provided that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ if the
Requisite Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained.

 



55 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated and the Merger abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.1_, written
notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any
party hereto (or any of its Representatives), and all rights and obligations
of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
otherwise provided in _Section 8.3_ or in any other provision of this
Agreement, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability
or damages resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination, in which case, except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.3_ and
_Section 9.13_, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies
available at law or in equity; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Guaranty and the indemnity provisions of
_Section 6.11_, this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.6_ and
_Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ in accordance with their respective terms.

 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_.

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by:

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, (y)
prior to such termination, a Competing Proposal shall have been made or
any Person shall have publicly announced or publicly made known an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make a Competing Proposal, in each case, after
the date of this Agreement and which has not been publicly withdrawn at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to such termination and (z) within twelve (12)
months of such termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement regarding any Competing Proposal with a Third Party, a
tender offer that constitutes a Competing Proposal is consummated or the
Company otherwise consummates a transaction regarding any Competing Proposal
(regardless of whether such Competing Proposal is the same one referred to in
clause (y) above), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, at the
direction of Parent an amount equal to $103,400,000 (the "Termination Fee"),
less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent, if any, not
later than two (2) Business Days following the date of the earlier of the
execution of a definitive agreement regarding a Competing Proposal or the
consummation of such tender offer or other transaction regarding a Competing
Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
8.3(a)(i)_, the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of
Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, at the direction of Parent the Termination Fee
concurrently with such termination;

(iii) Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, at the direction of Parent the Termination Fee not later
than two (2) Business Days following such termination; or

 

(iv) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_,
then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount equal to
$263,100,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") not later two (2) Business Days
following such termination.

 



56 (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either party pursuant
to  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ (or a termination by the Company pursuant to a
different section of _Section 8.1_ at a time when this Agreement was
terminable pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_), the Company shall promptly,
but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after being notified of
such by Parent, pay at the direction of Parent all of the reasonable
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub and
their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) up to a
maximum amount of $10,000,000 (the "Parent Expenses"), by wire transfer of
same day funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the parties agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent be
required to pay the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as the
case may be, on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys right set forth in the second to last sentence of
this _Section 8.3(c)_ and _Section 9.9_, the Companys right to receive
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_
shall, in the circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is owed
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and any other Company Related Parties against
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Guarantor, the Financing Sources under the Debt
Financing or any of their respective Affiliates or any direct or indirect,
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Parent Related
Parties") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt
Commitment Letters or in respect of any other document or theory of law or
equity or in respect of oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise it being understood and the Company agrees that the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be limited to
an amount equal to the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee, and in no
event shall the Company seek to recover any money damages in excess of such
amount (except that Parent shall also be obligated with respect to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 8.3(e)_ and _Section 8.6_ and for
any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained in
_Section 6.11_ and _Section 6.12_ and the Guarantor shall also be obligated
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Guaranty). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to _Section
9.9_, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, in circumstances where the Termination Fee
is owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ or _Section
8.3(a)(iii)_, shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors,

 



57  officers, employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of any breach or failure to perform hereunder giving
rise to such termination, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby with
respect to such breach or failure to perform (except that the Company shall
also be obligated with respect to _Section 8.3(e)_ and _Section 8.6_, as
applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form
of specific performance or equitable relief, to cause Parent and Acquisition
Sub to cause, or for the Company to directly cause, in accordance with its
third party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity
Financing to be funded on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement if, and only if, each of
the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all conditions in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall
be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied at the time
when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity
Financing to be funded, and remain satisfied, (ii) the financing provided for
by the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with _Section 6.11(d)_, pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) has been funded in accordance with its terms or will be funded at the
Closing in accordance with its terms if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (iii) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to
occur at the Closing, the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are
funded, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue a grant of specific performance of the type provided in the
preceding sentence and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under
_Section 8.3(a)(iv)_, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any monetary
damages, including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and
all or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Acquisition Sub under or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be limited to $263,100,000 in addition to any expense reimbursement
and indemnification obligations contained in _Section 6.11_, _Section
6.12_, _Section 8.3(e)_ and _Section 8.6_ (the "Liability Limitation"), and
in no event shall the Company seek or be entitled to multiple, special or
punitive damages against Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any recovery, judgment
or damages of any kind against Parent or Acquisition Sub in excess of the
Liability Limitation. The Company acknowledges, covenants and agrees
that neither it nor any other Company Related Party has and shall have no
right of recovery against, and no liability shall attach to, including in each
case with respect to any actual or claimed loss or damages of any kind of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, affiliates, Representatives or stockholders or
any other Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of the Company, any
of the Parent Related Parties (other than the Companys right to recover
against Parent and Acquisition Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement
and against the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guaranty), through
Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
applicable Law, through a claim based in tort, contract, statute or otherwise.

 



58 (e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this  _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Termination Fee and the Reverse
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this
_Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, either Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this
_Section 8.3_, such paying party shall pay the other party its costs and
Expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser
rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement
of the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective
boards of directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that
by Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires further
approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval of
such stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under applicable
Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties hereto.

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 8.6 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly set forth herein,
all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses. Parent shall pay or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary
Taxes or fees and (ii) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other
similar

 



59  Taxes or fees arising out of or in connection with entering into and
carrying out this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Parent,
Acquisition Sub, nor the Company shall be responsible for the payment of any
Taxes imposed upon a holder of Company Common Stock which result from the
transactions contemplated herein.

words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,

62  unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the remedies
and limitations thereon contained in _Section 8.3(c)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_
be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a partys
liability or obligations hereunder or under the Financing Commitments or the
Guarantees.

Section 9.5  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights

the Financing Sources under the Debt Financing of Parent and Acquisition Sub
(solely with respect to _Section 8.3_, _Section 9.4_, this _Section 9.7_,

counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof (including the Debt Financing), shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including

this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, subject to the penultimate sentence of _Section
8.3(c)_, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything to the

State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action
brought against any debt financing source of Parent and Acquisition Sub in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 9.10(a)_ in
any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.2_. However, the

on the other party by any other legally available method.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

 

GARDNER DENVER, INC.

 



FIRST: The name of the corporation (which is hereinafter referred to as the
"Corporation") is Gardner Denver, Inc.

SECOND: The name and address of the registered agent in the State of Delaware
is The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle
County, Delaware 19801.

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, as from time to time amended.

FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is one thousand (1,000) shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share.

FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law,
subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this certificate of
incorporation, bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed
by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but any bylaws
adopted by the Board of Directors may be amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon. Election of directors need not be by
written ballot.

SIXTH: (a) _Limitation of Liability_. No director of the Corporation shall be
personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except that the foregoing
provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any
breach of such directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Title 8,
Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) for any
transaction from which such director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the Delaware General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to authorize the
further elimination or limitation on personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on
personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the amended Delaware General Corporation Law.

_Indemnification_. Any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including an action by or in the right of the Corporation) (hereinafter a
"proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer
of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as
a director or  officer of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement,
actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such person
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) that
was initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The
right to indemnification conferred in this ARTICLE SIXTH, paragraph (b), shall
be a contract right. For purposes of this ARTICLE SIXTH, paragraph (b),
reference to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors and officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer
of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the
same position under the provisions of this ARTICLE SIXTH, paragraph (b), with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

_Payment of Expenses in Advance_. Expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by an officer or director in defending an action, suit or proceeding
referred to in ARTICLE SIXTH, paragraph (b), above may be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to
repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in ARTICLE SIXTH,
paragraph (b).

_Indemnification Not Exclusive_. The indemnification provided under ARTICLE
SIXTH, paragraph (b), shall not be deemed exclusive of (i) any other rights to
which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, any
agreement, any insurance purchased by the Corporation, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office or (ii) the power of the Corporation to indemnify any person who is or
was an employee or agent of the Corporation or of another corporation, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise that he or she is serving or has served at
the request of the Corporation, to the same extent and in the same
situations and subject to the same determinations with respect to directors
and officers. The indemnification provided by ARTICLE SIXTH, paragraph (b),
shall continue as to any person who has ceased to be a director or officer and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
person.

_Other_. Any repeal or modification of this ARTICLE SIXTH by the stockholders
of the Corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect
any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation or
the Indemnification of any officer or director of the Corporation existing
at the time of such repeal or modification.
