extent necessary or reasonably expected to be necessary to enable the
accessing Party to (1) conduct reasonable diligence on matters potentially
giving rise to liability on the part of the accessing Party or (2) defend
itself with respect to any liability on the part of the accessing Party, in
each case ((1) and (2)), if and to the extent that a fact, circumstance or
event has arisen that gives the accessing Party a reasonable basis to believe
that it has or may incur such liability, and (b) for use by the accessing
Party for such purpose. The immediately preceding sentence shall not require
any Party to provide access to any records in the event that the Parties'
interests in the matter potentially giving rise to liability are or may be

3.6.8 Press Releases. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
3.6, public announcements (such as press releases) that relate to the
Exploitation of any Territory Combination Product in the Territory, other than
with respect to Results, are governed by Article 16 and not this Section 3.6.

3.7 Third Party Uses of Combination Product Clinical Data. In the event a
Party intends the patient-level data from any Combination Product Clinical
Trials, or in the case of Janssen, Edurant Studies, conducted by or on behalf
of such Party under this Agreement be made publicly available to the
scientific community for further research through one or more industry
organizations, the Alliance Managers shall agree upon the timing of release of
such data from each such Combination Product Clinical Trial and Edurant Study
to such industry organization(s). The proposing Party (or its Affiliate) shall
have the right to release such data in an anonymized form to such industry
organization(s) of such Party's choosing in a manner that complies with any
Regulatory Authority requirements and Applicable Law; provided, however, that
if the Alliance Managers do not reach agreement upon the timing of releasing
patient-level data from such Combination Product Clinical Trial(s) and Edurant
Study(ies) to such industry organization(s) within the time period set forth
in Section 20.6.1, the matter shall be referred to the Executives for
resolution pursuant to Section 20.6.1 and if the Executives do not resolve the
matter within the Executives Review Period, the data in question shall not be
released by the proposing Party to such industry organization(s) until the
Alliance Managers or Executives later agree on such release or, if earlier,
[*] after the end of the Executives Review Period.

3.8 Limitations on Disclosure of [*]. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

[ * ] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY
BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





4.1.14 Diligence. For clarity, without limiting a Party's obligations under
Article 3, this Section 4.1.1 shall not be construed to require a Party to use
any efforts to perform any studies or other development activities (other than
regulatory activities).

4.1.14.1 Gilead shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain and
maintain a first Marketing Approval for each of the Territory Combination
Products in the Field from each of the FDA and the European Commission, and
the applicable Regulatory Authorities in [*]; provided, however, that such
obligation to obtain and maintain with respect to Territory Complera shall
[*].

4.1.14.2 Janssen shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain and
maintain a first Marketing Approval (a) for Edurant in the Field from each of
the FDA and the European Commission, and the applicable Regulatory Authorities
in [*] and (b) for each of the Territory Combination Products in the Field
from the applicable Regulatory Authorities in each Janssen Diligence Country;
provided, however, that the obligation in clause (b) of this Section 4.1.1.2
with respect to Territory Complera shall [*]. In the event that Gilead
believes that Janssen is in breach of its obligations under clause (b) of this
Section 4.1.1.2 with respect to a given Territory Combination Product, Gilead
shall have the right to give Janssen written notice specifying the nature of
such breach. Janssen shall have a period of [*] after receipt of such written
notice to cure such breach. If Janssen does not cure such breach within such
[*] period, [*].

4.1.15 Performance; Subcontracting. The Selling Party, in the case of each
Territory Combination Product, and Janssen, in the case of Edurant, shall
perform, or cause its Affiliates or permitted subcontractors, as applicable,
to perform, any activities with respect to obtaining or maintaining Regulatory
Approvals for the Territory Combination Products and Edurant, respectively, in
the Field in material compliance with the requirements of Applicable Law. The
Selling Party, in the case of the Combination Product Regulatory Activities,
and Janssen, in the case of Edurant Regulatory Activities, may subcontract the
performance of their respective regulatory activities; provided, however, that
the subcontracting Party shall oversee the performance by its subcontractors
of the subcontracted activities in a manner that would be reasonably expected
to result in their timely and successful completion and shall remain
responsible for the performance of such activities in accordance with this
Agreement.

4.1.16 Limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1, neither
Party shall have any obligation under this Agreement to obtain or maintain
Regulatory Approvals for the other Party's Single Agent Product(s) or Double
Agent Products, as applicable, in any country in the Territory. Gilead shall
be relieved of its diligence obligation under the first sentence of Section
4.1.1.1 in any applicable country to the extent that (i) Janssen fails to
obtain and maintain a first Marketing Approval for Edurant in the Field in the
applicable country or (ii) pursuant to Section 4.3.3, Janssen withholds from
the relevant Regulatory Authority any information relating to Edurant that is
reasonably requested by Gilead to be provided to such Regulatory Authority in
order for Gilead to obtain or maintain a Marketing Approval for a Territory
Combination Product in the Field in such country.

4.2 Registration Plan.

BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





4.2.1 Creation. An initial plan of activities for obtaining and maintaining a
first Marketing Approval for the Territory R/F/TAF Product in the Field in
each of the Major Market Countries is attached hereto as Annex JJ (such plan,
together with the plan existing as of the Restatement Effective Date for
obtaining and maintaining first Marketing Approvals for Territory Complera in
the Field in each of certain countries in the Territory, the "Registration
Plan").

4.2.2 Updates. From time to time during the Term, each Party shall submit any
updates it may have to the Registration Plan to the other Party's Alliance
Manager.

4.2.3 Purpose. The Registration Plan shall be established and updated solely
for the purpose of coordinating logistics regarding filing for Marketing
Approvals for the Territory Combination Products in the Field in the
Territory. It is not intended to impose any binding obligation on either Party
to perform the activities set forth therein.

4.3 Regulatory Documentation to be Provided by the Parties.

4.3.3 Regulatory Documentation for Use by Gilead. Subject to Section 4.3.3,
Janssen shall provide Gilead with full access to and copies (in electronic
form) of (i) the Janssen Regulatory Documentation and (ii) any other
information related to a Territory Combination Product in the possession and
Control of Janssen or its Affiliates, in each case, as Gilead may request,
solely for the purpose of, and in the case of clause (ii) solely as necessary
or reasonably expected to be necessary for the Gilead Permitted Use, provided
that Janssen may redact any Janssen Redactable Information from such Janssen
Regulatory Documentation or other information. In the event that Janssen does
not agree that any information described in clause (ii) above requested by
Gilead is necessary or reasonably expected to be necessary for the Gilead
Permitted Use, or Gilead believes that Janssen has redacted information from
Janssen Regulatory Documentation or other information requested by Gilead
under this Section 4.3.1 that is not Janssen Redactable Information, either
Party may refer such matter to the Alliance Managers for resolution. If the
Alliance Managers do not reach consensus with respect to such matter within
the time period set forth in Section 20.6.1, such matter may be escalated by
either Party to the Executives pursuant to Section 20.6.1 and, in the event
that the Executives do not reach agreement on such matter within the
Executives Review Period, such matter shall be an Expert Dispute.

4.3.4 Regulatory Documentation for use by Janssen. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that Gilead has previously provided Janssen the CTD for Territory
Complera, and Gilead shall hereafter reasonably promptly provide Janssen with
any updates by Gilead to the CTD for Territory Complera. Reasonably promptly
following the later of the filing of the NDA or the authorization for
Marketing Approval with the European Commission for the Territory R/F/TAF
Product, Gilead shall provide Janssen the CTD for the Territory R/F/TAF
Product for use by Janssen in connection with obtaining and maintaining
Regulatory Approvals for the Territory R/F/TAF Product in the Field in the
Janssen Countries, and shall thereafter reasonably promptly provide Janssen
with any updates by Gilead to the CTD for the Territory R/F/TAF Product. The
CTDs for Territory Complera and the Territory R/F/TAF Product, and updates
thereto, shall be used by Janssen solely to obtain and maintain Regulatory
Approvals for Territory Complera and

BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





the Territory R/F/TAF Product, as applicable, in the Field in the Janssen
Countries. Janssen shall include the applicable CTD (as updated by any updates
provided by Gilead pursuant to this Section 4.3.2) in each Drug Approval
Application (to the extent required to comply with the requirements for such
Drug Approval Application) filed to obtain and maintain a first Marketing
Approval in the Field for each Territory Combination Product in any Janssen
Country. Janssen's regulatory filings with the Regulatory Authorities,
including Drug Approval Applications, with respect to each Territory
Combination Product in the Janssen Countries shall be consistent with the
applicable CTD and updates thereto. Janssen shall, to the extent required by
Applicable Law or otherwise reasonably requested by Gilead, exercise
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to update any such filings promptly to reflect
any updates to the CTDs as are provided by Gilead to Janssen pursuant to this
Section 4.3.2 from time to time after such filings are made. Gilead shall
provide electronic versions of the CTDs (including any updates thereto) to
Janssen in a mutually agreed-upon format for the purpose of expediting
Janssen's activities in preparing and filing Regulatory Documentation for the
Janssen Countries.

4.3.5 Additional Regulatory Documentation Provided by Either Party Following
Marketing Approval.

4.3.5.1 Once Gilead or any of its Affiliates, Sublicensees or Third Party
Distributors has obtained a first Marketing Approval for a Territory
Combination Product in the Field in a country, Janssen may not withhold
Regulatory Documentation or other information related to such Territory
Combination Product or Janssen's Single Agent Product in Janssen's or its
Affiliates' Control that Gilead reasonably requires to comply with Applicable
Law with regards to such Territory Combination Product in such country. Except
as otherwise expressly authorized by Janssen, Gilead (and its Affiliates)
shall have the right to use any additional information related to a Territory
Combination Product or Janssen's Single Agent Product provided or made
available pursuant to the foregoing sentence (and not pursuant to any other
provision hereunder) solely to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable
Law (solely for regulatory purposes contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement). The provisions of this Section 4.3.3.1 shall survive
expiration of this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, if any
Regulatory Authority requires, in order for Gilead (or its Affiliate,
Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor) to obtain or maintain Regulatory
Approval for a Territory Combination Product in any Gilead Country, any
Regulatory Documentation or other information (including any analyses of any
data relating to RPV and results thereof), and Gilead would have the
obligation under the Amended D/C/F/TAF Agreement to provide analogous
Regulatory Documentation or information (including analyses and results
thereof) to Janssen, then Section 4.3.1.3 or other applicable Section of the
Amended D/C/F/TAF Agreement, as applicable, and any defined terms used therein
shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to such information or analyses
(e.g., references to Gilead shall be changed to Janssen, references to "COBI,
FTC or TAF" shall be changed to "RPV (as defined in the Complera Agreement),"
references to "DRV" shall be changed to "FTC, TAF or TDF (as defined in the
Complera Agreement)", references to "STR Clinical Trial" shall be changed to
"Combination Product Clinical Trial" and references to "the Licensed STR"
shall be changed to "a Territory Combination Product (as defined in the
Complera Agreement)"), except that references to "Gilead Redactable
Information" in Section 4.3.1.3 or any other Section of the Amended D/C/F/

BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





TAF Agreement shall be deemed to be replaced with the term "Janssen Redactable
Information" as defined in this Agreement and references to "Regulatory Leads"
in Section 4.3.1.1 or any other Section of the Amended D/C/F/TAF Agreement
shall be deemed to be replaced with "Alliance Managers (or their designees)."

4.3.5.2 Once Janssen or any of its Affiliates or Third Party Distributors has
obtained a first Marketing Approval for a Territory Combination Product in the
Field in a country, Gilead may not withhold Regulatory Documentation or other
information related to such Territory Combination Product or Gilead's Single
Agent Products or Double Agent Products in Gilead's or its Affiliates' Control
that Janssen reasonably requires to comply with Applicable Law with regards to
such Territory Combination Product in such country. Except as otherwise
expressly authorized by Gilead, Janssen (and its Affiliates) shall have the
right to use any additional information related to a Territory Combination
Product or Gilead's Single Agent Products or Double Agent Products provided or
made available pursuant to the foregoing sentence (and not pursuant to any
other provision hereunder) solely to the extent necessary to comply with
Applicable Law (solely for regulatory purposes contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement). The provisions of this Section 4.3.3.2 shall
survive expiration of this Agreement.

4.3.5.3 Limitations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (other
than Section 4.3.3.1 or Section 4.3.3.2), except in the case of the FDA, EMA,
the European Commission or any Regulatory Authority in [*], a Party shall have
no obligation hereunder to provide to the other Party or any Regulatory
Authority, in connection with any filings to obtain Regulatory Approvals of a
Territory Combination Product in the Field in the Territory, any information
relating to its API or any of its other products (including its Single Agent
Product(s) or Double Agent Products), as the case may be, the disclosure of
which such first Party reasonably believes may harm its or its Affiliates'
business interests with respect to its API or any of its other products
(including its Single Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Products).

4.4 Regulatory Filings and Communication.

4.4.1 MA Holder. With respect to each country in the Territory, unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties or prohibited by Applicable Law,
the Selling Party, or its designated Affiliate, Sublicensee or (subject to
Section 9.3.3 and, in the case of a Janssen Country, the Janssen Distributor
Agreement) Third Party Distributor, shall hold any Drug Approval Application
or Marketing Approval with respect to a Territory Combination Product with
respect to such country. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Gilead
hereby transfers, and shall cause its Affiliates, Sublicensees or Third Party
Distributors to transfer, to Janssen all of its and their right, title and
interest in the Marketing Approvals for Territory Complera for Russia and
China to Janssen and, following the Restatement Effective Date, the Parties
shall coordinate to transfer, subject to the terms of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, such Marketing Approvals to Janssen as promptly as
practicable after the Restatement Effective Date. To the extent such transfer
is prohibited by Applicable Law, Gilead shall hold the Marketing
Authorization(s) for the benefit of Janssen subject to the terms of this

BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. For clarity, such transfer of such
Marketing Authorization(s) does not convey any ownership interest in the data
contained therein. For clarity, Gilead will hold the Import Drug License for
China.

4.4.2 Responsibilities With Respect to Combination Product Regulatory Filings.
Subject to Section 4.3 and the remainder of this Section 4.4, with respect to
each country in the Territory, the Selling Party, on behalf of the applicable
entity designated to be the MA Holder with respect to such country, with the
cooperation of the non-Selling Party as reasonably required, shall have
primary responsibility for preparing and filing all necessary Regulatory
Documentation and for acting as liaison for all communications with the
Regulatory Authorities in such country for the purpose of obtaining and
maintaining Regulatory Approval for the applicable Territory Combination
Product in the Field in such country, including, subject to Section 4.4.2.2
below, with respect to any changes to the Product Label for such Territory
Combination Product; provided, however, that for each of Russia and China,
during any period in which such country is a Janssen Country and Gilead (or
its Affiliate) is the MA Holder with respect to a Territory Combination
Product with respect to such country, Janssen shall not file any Regulatory
Documentation or otherwise communicate with a Regulatory Authority with
respect to such Territory Combination Product in such country unless such
filing or the substance of such communication has been approved by Gilead in
writing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Parties shall agree in writing on reasonable timeframes and
processes to facilitate the foregoing approval process. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party shall be responsible
for preparing and submitting any Regulatory Documentation or other materials
with respect to any clinical trial that it or its Affiliate conducts (either
solely or with one or more Third Parties) pursuant to this Agreement and the
Party that is not the MA Holder for a given country may obtain and maintain
INDs for such country in support of Combination Product Clinical Trials that
such Party is permitted to conduct under Article 3.

4.4.2.1 Discussion of Single Agent Products or Double Agent Product.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
meeting with, or any communication to, Regulatory Authorities in the Territory
concerning a Territory Combination Product, the Selling Party shall not engage
in any substantive discussions pertaining to the other Party's Single Agent
Product(s) or Double Agent Product(s) or the API contained therein, without
such other Party's prior written consent.

4.4.2.2 Label Change for Single Agent Products or Double Agent Product. If any
communications from Regulatory Authorities in the Territory regarding
potential changes to any Product Label for a Territory Combination Product in
the Territory are reasonably expected to lead to a change in the Product Label
for a Party's Single Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Products, as the case
may be, and are not reasonably expected to lead to a change in the Product
Label for the other Party's Single Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Products,
as the case may be, then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the affected Party shall take the lead (in coordination with the
Selling Party, if such Party is not the Selling Party) in dealing with such
Regulatory Authorities on such matter.

4.4.2.3 PVA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Party which has responsibility
for communications with Regulatory Authorities in a country relating to
routine safety-related submissions (e.g., individual case reports) pursuant to
the PVA, shall have the right to communicate (or to cause one or more of its
Affiliates or Third Party distributors to communicate) with Regulatory
Authorities in such country in the Territory concerning such submissions in
accordance with the terms of the PVA in a manner consistent with any
determinations with respect to such communications made pursuant to the PVA.

4.4.3 Price Regulatory Approvals. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.4
to the contrary, this Section 4.4 shall not govern the obtaining and
maintaining of pricing and reimbursement approvals in the Field in the
Territory with respect to the Territory Combination Products, or any
communications with any Regulatory Authorities with respect to the foregoing
matters. For clarity, such approvals and communications shall be governed by
Article 6.

4.4.4 Regulatory Matters Concerning Single/Double Agent Products. Nothing
contained in this Section 4.4 shall prohibit or restrict either Party from
communicating with the Regulatory Authorities on matters relating to the
Exploitation of any of its respective Single Agent Product(s), Double Agent
Products or pharmaceutical products other than the Territory Combination
Products. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any change
proposed by the notifying Party to any Product Label for any of its Single
Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Products in the Field in the Territory that
is substantive in nature, where such proposed change is reasonably expected to
have an impact on any Product Label for a Territory Combination Product,
reasonably in advance of the anticipated filing date of such proposed change,
by furnishing the other Party with the text of the proposed change and a
summary description of the data supporting or basis for such proposed change,
and, if requested by the notified Party, existing written summaries of any
cumulative review done by or on behalf of the notifying Party, provided that
the notifying Party may redact any Gilead Redactable Information (in the case
of Gilead as the notifying Party) or Janssen Redactable Information (in the
case of Janssen as the notifying Party), as applicable. In addition, promptly
after the filing of such proposed change with the applicable Regulatory
Authorities in the Territory, the Party that has provided such notice shall
furnish the other Party with the text of the proposed change as filed. Any
resulting filing with respect to the Product Label for a Territory Combination
Product shall be governed by Section 4.4.2 and any documentation required in
connection with such filing shall be exchanged to the extent and in the manner
set forth in Section 4.3.

4.4.5 Regulatory Matters Concerning a Party's Compliance with Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, as between the Parties,
regardless of which Party is the Selling Party, each Party shall have sole
responsibility for any submissions to, or communications with, any Regulatory
Authority in the Territory with respect to any matter relating to such Party's
or any of its Affiliates', subcontractors' or Third Party Distributor's
compliance with Applicable Law in connection with its performance of such
Party's Commercialization Activities, unless such submissions or
communications are made in connection with obtaining or maintaining the
applicable Drug Approval Application (in which case the applicable provisions
of this Section 4.4 shall control).

4.4.6 Activities in the EU. This Section 4.4 shall apply to the preparing and
filing of all necessary Regulatory Documentation and communications with the
Regulatory Authorities of the European Union, including the EMA, as if the
European Union were a "country" for purposes of this Section 4.4.

4.5 Activities in Japan. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary in this Agreement, in the case of Japan, Gilead's rights and
obligations under this Agreement may, at Gilead's option, be exercised or
performed, as applicable, by its (sub)licensee for Japan; provided, however,
that Gilead shall remain fully responsible for the performance of such
(sub)licensee.

4.6 Records. Each Party shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records
with respect to its activities pursuant to this Article 4 in material
compliance with Applicable Law. Such records shall be retained for at least
(a) ten (10) years following creation or (b) such longer period as may be
required by the In-License Requirements or Applicable Law.

4.7 Regulatory Costs and Expenses. With respect to each country in the
Territory, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses relating to the
Combination Product Regulatory Activities and regulatory filings for the
Territory Combination Products in such country. Janssen or its applicable
Affiliate shall bear all costs and expenses relating to Edurant Regulatory
Activities and any regulatory filings relating to Edurant, and Gilead or its
applicable Affiliate shall bear all costs and expenses relating to regulatory
activities and filings relating to of Gilead's Single Agent Products or Double
Agent Products.

4.8 Regulatory Dependencies. Annex AA-2 sets forth those Janssen Countries in
which a Marketing Approval for a Territory Combination Product relies upon or
references a Marketing Approval for such Territory Combination Product for the
European Union or any Gilead Country (each such Janssen Country, a "Janssen
Reliant Country"). Gilead shall provide Janssen [*] notice of any voluntary
withdrawal or abandonment of a Marketing Approval in any country that is
specified in Annex AA-2 as a country that is referenced or relied upon by any
Janssen Reliant Country (a "Gilead Marketing Approval"). [*]. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 4.8 shall not apply to preclude Gilead from
engaging in any withdrawal of a Gilead Marketing Approval due to safety,
efficacy or public health reasons or as required or requested by a Regulatory
Authority.

to utilize and deploy its medical science liaisons for activities relating to
a Territory Combination Product in such countries.

5.2 Responses to Medical Inquiries.

5.2.6 Gilead Countries. Gilead shall apply its standard guidelines and
procedures for determining and providing appropriate responses to medical
inquiries about each

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





Combination Product in the Gilead Countries. Gilead shall ensure that any such
response procedures and standard response documents comply with Applicable
Law.

5.2.7 Janssen Countries. Gilead shall make available to Janssen a core set of
standard response documents for responding to medical inquiries about each
Combination Product ("Core SRDs"), and Janssen shall use only such Core SRDs
or adaptations thereof in responding to medical inquiries about the applicable
Combination Product in the Janssen Countries, subject to Janssen's ensuring
that such Core SRDs and adaptations comply with Applicable Law. With respect
to any Janssen Country for which Gilead (or its Affiliate, Sublicensee or
Third Party Distributor) is the MA Holder for a Territory Combination Product,
Janssen shall not use any adaptation of the Core SRDs (regardless of whether
or not such adaptation reflects a change in the content of the Core SRDs) in
responding to medical inquiries about such Territory Combination Product in
such Janssen Country unless and until Gilead has approved such adaptation in
writing. With respect to any Janssen Country for which Janssen (or its
Affiliate or Third Party Distributor) is the MA Holder for a Territory
Combination Product, Janssen shall not use any adaptation of the Core SRDs
that reflects a change in the content of the Core SRDs in responding to
medical inquiries about such Territory Combination Product in such Janssen
Country unless and until Gilead has approved such adaptation in writing.
Subject to the foregoing, Janssen shall apply its standard guidelines and
procedures for determining and providing appropriate responses to medical
inquiries about each Combination Product in the Janssen Countries, and Janssen
shall ensure that any such response procedures comply with Applicable Law. In
the event that Gilead does not provide any Core SRDs to Janssen with respect
to a Territory Combination Product, Janssen may respond to any medical
inquiries based on the approved Product Label for such Territory Combination
Product.

5.2.8 Referrals. With respect to each country, the non-Selling Party shall
refer any medical inquiries that it receives about a Territory Combination
Product in such country (unless it relates specifically to RPV (if the non-
Selling Party is Janssen) or to TAF, TDF or FTC (if the non-Selling Party is
Gilead)) to the Selling Party or to such person(s) as the Selling Party shall
designate. Each Party shall refer any medical inquiries that it receives about
the other Party's Single Agent Products or Double Agent Products to the other
Party or to such person(s) as the other Party shall designate.

5.2.9 Procedures. Without limiting the foregoing or anything in the Janssen
Distributor Agreement, the Alliance Managers shall ensure that appropriate
procedures are in place for the Parties to respond to medical inquiries about
a Territory Combination Product that go beyond the information contained in
the Product Label for such Territory Combination Product. If at any time a
Party has concerns about the other Party's procedures for responding to
medical inquiries about a Territory Combination Product or standard response
documents for use in responding to medical inquiries about a Territory
Combination Product, the concerned Party may refer the matter to the Alliance
Managers and the Alliance Managers shall facilitate discussion and resolution
of such concerns.

5.3 Conferences and Symposia. Janssen shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates not to) participate in or sponsor any formal presentation or panel
or medical booths with respect to a

with respect to a Combination Product at any conference or symposia without
the prior written consent of Gilead; provided, however, that Janssen may
participate in or sponsor such presentations or panels or medical booths or
provide such information at conferences or symposia (other than international
meetings) in the Janssen Countries. Gilead shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates not to) participate in or sponsor any formal presentation or panel
or medical booths with respect to any RPV Product at any conference or
symposia anywhere in the Territory or with respect to any Combination Product
at any conference or symposia (other than international meetings) in the
Janssen Countries, or provide any information with respect to any RPV Product
at any conference or symposia anywhere in the Territory or with respect to any
Combination Product at any conference or symposia (other than international
meetings) in the Janssen Countries, without the prior written consent of
Janssen.

6.2 Commercialization Activities.

6.2.7 Diligence. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Selling Party (or its Affiliate, Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor) shall
have the sole right to perform Commercialization Activities for a Territory
Combination Product with respect to the countries for which it is the Selling
Party.

6.2.7.1 Gilead shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform
Commercialization Activities (including through its Affiliates, Sublicensees
or Third Party Distributors), including Premarket Launch Activities, for each
Territory Combination Product in each of the Major Market Countries; provided,
however, that such obligation with respect to Territory Complera shall
terminate with respect to each Major Market Country, [*].

6.2.7.2 Janssen shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform
Commercialization Activities (including through its Affiliates or Third Party
Distributors), including Premarket Launch Activities, for each Territory
Combination Product in each of the Janssen Diligence Countries; provided,
however, that such obligation with respect to Territory Complera shall
terminate with respect to each Janssen Diligence Country [*]. In the event
that Gilead believes that Janssen is in breach of its obligations under this
Section 6.2.1.2

with respect to a given Territory Combination Product in a Janssen Diligence
Country, Gilead shall have the right to give Janssen written notice specifying
the nature of such breach. Janssen shall have a period of [*] after receipt of
such written notice to cure such breach. If Janssen does not cure such breach
within such [*] period, [*].

6.2.8 Specific Commercialization Obligations. Without limitation of Section
6.2.1, Gilead agrees to the following solely with respect to each of the Major
Market Countries other than [*]:

6.2.8.6 With respect to each Major Market Country other than [*], as of the
later of the first Marketing Approval or First Commercial Sale of Territory
Complera in the applicable country until the earlier of (x) [*] or (y) [*]
(such period, a "Complera Launch Period"), Gilead shall ensure (and certify in
writing each Calendar Quarter) that the incentive compensation provided by
Gilead each Calendar Quarter with respect to Territory Complera to each of the
sales representatives of Gilead who are responsible for Detailing Complera in
such Major Market Country satisfies the following criteria: the incentive
compensation payable to each such sales representative if such sales
representative achieves his or her target sales for such Calendar Quarter with
respect to Territory Complera shall equal or exceed twenty five percent (25%)
of the total incentive compensation such sales representative is eligible to
receive if he or she achieves his or her target sales for such Calendar
Quarter for all of the products for which such sales representative is
responsible for Detailing.

6.2.8.7 [Reserved]

6.2.8.8 For each Detailing Year (as defined below), through the Calendar
Quarter that includes the last day of the applicable Launch Period, Gilead
shall perform the number of Details of each Territory Combination Product in
the specific Major Market Countries set forth in Section 1(a) or 1(b) of Annex
F, as applicable, in either the first or second product presentation during
the call in which such Detail occurs. Gilead shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to ensure that the number of such Details for each such Major Market
Country in each Calendar Quarter of each Detailing Year is no less than twenty
percent (20%) of the number of Details required for such Major Market Country
for such Detailing Year; provided, however, the Parties may by written mutual
agreement modify such obligation on a country-by-country basis due to local
extrinsic conditions (e.g., seasonality) that may impact the ability of Gilead
to fulfill such obligation. Gilead shall certify in writing its compliance
with this Section 6.2.2.3 on a quarterly basis. A "Detailing Year" for an
applicable Major Market Country shall mean, in the case of Territory Complera,
(A) in the case of the first Detailing Year, the period beginning on the first
day of the first full Calendar Quarter after the later to occur of the First
Commercial Sale or the first Marketing Approval of Territory Complera in such
Major Market Country through the end of the Calendar Year in which such First
Commercial Sale or the first Marketing Approval, as applicable, occurs (in
which case, Gilead's obligations under this paragraph with respect to such
Detailing Year (but not with respect to any Calendar Quarter in such Detailing
Year) shall be prorated accordingly), and (B) in the case of each other
Detailing Year, the Calendar Year following the prior Detailing Year, until
the end of the Calendar Quarter that includes the last day of the applicable
Launch Period (and in the case of the last Detailing

Year with respect to a Major Market Country, Gilead's obligations under this
paragraph with respect to such Detailing Year (but not with respect to any
Calendar Quarter in such Detailing Year) shall be prorated accordingly). A
"Detailing Year" for an applicable Major Market Country shall mean, in the
case of Territory R/F/TAF Product, [*]. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Parties may from time to time mutually agree in
writing on adjustments to the number of Details set forth in Annex F.

6.2.8.9 Gilead acknowledges and agrees that Gilead's achievement of each and
all of the requirements in Sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.3 (the "Specific
Targets") with respect to each applicable Major Market Country goes to the
root of this Agreement and is an essential element of this Agreement, and that
Gilead's failure to substantially achieve each or any of the Specific Targets
with respect to an applicable Major Market Country is a Material Breach that
entitles Janssen to terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable
Territory Combination Product pursuant to Section 19.4 if Gilead fails to cure
such failure as provided in Section 19.4 or, with respect to each Initial
Specific Target Breach, Section 6.2.2.5.

6.2.8.10 With respect to each Initial Specific Target Breach, Janssen agrees
that Gilead shall be deemed to have cured such failure if Gilead complies with
the following (each a "Specific Cure") with respect to the applicable failure:

a. in the case of a breach of Section 6.2.2.1 with respect to an applicable
Major Market Country, for a number of consecutive Calendar Quarters equal to
the number that Gilead was so in breach, starting with the Calendar Quarter
immediately following the Calendar Quarter in which Gilead received written
notice of such breach, Gilead complies (and on a quarterly basis certifies its
compliance in writing) with the requirements of Section 6.2.2.1 in all
respects, except that the incentive compensation with respect to Territory
Complera for such period shall be thirty percent (30%) instead of twenty-five
percent (25%); and

b. in the case of a breach of Section 6.2.2.3 with respect to an applicable
Major Market Country for a given Detailing Year (or a given Calendar Quarter
within a Detailing Year), no later than ninety (90) days following Gilead's
receipt of notice of such breach, Gilead conducts in such country a number of
Details of the applicable Territory Combination Product, in either the first
or second product presentation during the call in which such Detail occurs,
equal to the number of Details by which Gilead fell short of its obligations
under Section 6.2.2.3 with respect to such country and such Detailing Year (or
Calendar Quarter, as applicable), provided that the Details performed by
Gilead in curing said breach shall not count toward Gilead's fulfillment of
its Detailing obligations under Section 6.2.2.3 for any Calendar Quarter or
Detailing Year other than the Calendar Quarter and Detailing Year in which the
breach occurred;

provided, however, that, with respect to each applicable Major Market Country,
once Gilead successfully completes a Specific Cure for a given Territory
Combination Product with respect to a breach of Sections 6.2.2.1 or 6.2.2.3,
no further breach of the same section in such country shall automatically be
deemed cured by a Specific Cure with respect to such Territory Combination
Product, and the curing of any such further breach shall be governed by the
general principles governing cure set forth in Section 19.4 and not by this
Section 6.2.2.5.

6.2.8.11 If there is a modification in Applicable Law or industry guidelines
with respect to the compensation of, or activities performed by,
pharmaceutical sales representatives, or if Detailing is prohibited at
customer facilities, then, to the extent such modification or prohibition
would render the achievement of the Specific Targets commercially
impracticable or unethical, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
substitute obligations, which obligations take account of such modification or
prohibition.

For clarification, the satisfaction of the obligations of Sections 6.2.2.1 and
6.2.2.3 does not necessarily, in and of itself, constitute satisfaction of
Gilead's obligations under Section 6.2.1.

6.2.9 Performance; Subcontracting. Each Party shall comply, and shall cause
its Affiliates and any of its permitted subcontractors to comply, with all
Applicable Law and the requirements of all Regulatory Approvals for the
Territory Combination Products in conducting their respective
Commercialization Activities. Either Party may subcontract the performance of
Commercialization Activities allocated to it hereunder, including to a
contract sales organization or Distribution Subcontractor; provided, however,
that (i) Gilead shall not use a contract sales organization in any of the
Major Market Countries, (ii) Janssen shall not use a contract sales
organization to conduct its Detailing activities with respect to a Territory
Combination Product in any Gilead Country and (iii) the subcontracting Party
shall oversee the performance by its subcontractors of such subcontracted
Commercialization Activities in a manner that would be reasonably expected to
result in their timely and successful completion and shall remain responsible
for the performance of such Commercialization Activities in accordance with
this Agreement.

6.2.10 Co-Detailing LOAs. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties
(or their Affiliates) currently have (or may in the future have) certain
additional rights and obligations with respect to the Detailing of the
Territory Combination Products in certain countries, as set forth in the Co-
Detailing LOA's for the applicable countries in each Co-Detailing LOA, or as
may be set forth from time to time by other separate written agreements
between the Parties. For each Co-Detailing LOA, unless and until such Co-
Detailing LOA is amended to cover the Parties' activities with respect to the
Territory R/F/TAF Product (or unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in
writing), the provisions of such Co-Detailing LOA shall be deemed to apply to
the Territory R/F/TAF Product to the same extent as they apply to Territory
Complera.

6.3 Co-Detailing; Responses to Unsolicited Questions.

6.3.9 Co-Detailing.

6.3.9.1 Territory Complera. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as of the
Restatement Effective Date, Janssen has made an election under the Original
Agreement to commence, at its expense, Detailing of Territory Complera in each
country listed in Annex FF, and, during the Term with respect to each such
country, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreements, Janssen shall have the non-exclusive right to Detail
Territory Complera in such country; provided, however, that such right shall
terminate with respect to any country upon the First Commercial Sale of the
Territory R/F/

TAF Product in such country; provided, however, that with respect to any
country in which Janssen or its applicable Affiliate is Detailing Territory
Complera as of the First Commercial Sale of the Territory R/F/TAF Product in
such country, such termination shall be effective at the conclusion of a
reasonable wind down period to be agreed by the Parties. For any country
listed in Annex FF in which the First Commercial Sale of Territory Complera
has not occurred as of the Restatement Effective Date, if Janssen or its
applicable Affiliate decides not to commence Detailing Territory Complera in
such country upon the First Commercial Sale of Territory Complera in such
country, or to commence Detailing Territory Complera in such country at any
time after the First Commercial Sale of Territory Complera in such country,
Janssen shall notify Gilead of such decision promptly after such decision is
made.

6.3.9.2 Territory R/F/TAF Product. During the Term, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreements, Janssen shall have
the non-exclusive right to Detail, at its expense, the Territory R/F/TAF
Product in each country listed in Annex FF. Subject to the preceding sentence,
Detailing by Janssen or its applicable Affiliate under this Section 6.3.1.2
may commence upon or after the First Commercial Sale of the Territory R/F/TAF
Product in the applicable country; provided, however, that if Janssen or its
applicable Affiliate decides not to commence Detailing the Territory R/F/TAF
Product in a country upon the First Commercial Sale of the Territory R/F/TAF
Product in such country, or to commence Detailing the Territory R/F/TAF
Product in a country at any time after the First Commercial Sale of the
Territory R/F/TAF Product in such country, Janssen shall notify Gilead of such
decision promptly after such decision is made.

6.3.10 Responses to Unsolicited Questions and Related Matters.

6.3.10.3 Each Party may, with respect to the countries in which it is the
Selling Party, respond to unsolicited questions that it receives with respect
to any Territory Combination Product in such countries.

6.3.10.4 For any country in Region A, the non-Selling Party with respect to
such country (and its Affiliates) may respond to unsolicited questions that it
receives with respect to any Territory Combination Product solely in
accordance with Applicable Law and based solely upon the Product Label for the
applicable Territory Combination Product in such country in Region A and any
approved materials the Selling Party provides to the non-Selling Party for
responding to such questions in such country, which approved materials may be
withdrawn from use by the Selling Party at any time upon notice to the non-
Selling Party.

6.3.10.5 For any country in Region B or Region C, the non-Selling Party with
respect to such country and its Affiliates shall not respond to any
unsolicited question that they receive with respect to any Territory
Combination Product and shall use reasonable efforts to refer any such
unsolicited questions to the Selling Party for such country.

6.3.10.6 Janssen may not market or promote (other than Detail in accordance
with Section 6.3.1) any Territory Combination Product in any Gilead Country.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in Section 6.3.2.2
or Section 6.3.2.3, Janssen may, in connection with its Detailing of the
Territory Combination Products in

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

accordance with Section 6.3.1 or its activities relating to Edurant or RPV,
respond to unsolicited questions that it receives with respect to the
Territory Combination Products, provided that Janssen responds solely in
accordance with any approved slide deck or other background materials provided
by Gilead to Janssen for the purpose of responding to such questions. Such
approved slide deck or other background materials shall comply with Applicable
Law and shall be provided by Gilead to Janssen in accordance with procedures
to be agreed upon by the Alliance Managers. In the event Gilead does not
provide such slide deck or other materials, Janssen may respond to such
questions that do not relate specifically to RPV based solely upon the Product
Label for the applicable Territory Combination Product in such country. In
connection with Gilead's Detailing activities, Gilead shall refer any
unsolicited questions with respect to Edurant or RPV to Janssen.

6.3.10.7 For clarity, this Section 6.3 is not intended to (a) apply to medical
inquiries about Territory Combination Products, which are governed by Section
5.2, or (b) restrict the ability of Janssen to respond to any unsolicited
questions with respect to Edurant or RPV or (c) restrict the ability of Gilead
to respond to any unsolicited questions with respect to any Gilead Compound
Product or FTC, TDF or TAF. Each Party shall cause its Affiliates,
Sublicensees and Third Party Distributors to comply with the terms of this
Section 6.3 as if such Affiliate, Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor were
a Party.

6.4 [Reserved].

6.5 Third Party Distributors. Gilead shall have the right, with respect to all
countries in the Territory other than the Janssen Countries, to engage a Third
Party Distributor to Distribute Territory Combination Products. In the event
Gilead decides to engage a Third Party Distributor with respect to any
Territory Combination Product with respect to any country in Region A (other
than a Gilead Take-Over Country) for which Gilead has not previously engaged a
Third Party distributor for any of its products and Gilead desires to engage a
Third Party Distributor for such country which Third Party Distributor does
not already serve as a distributor for any Gilead Products in any country, (a)
Gilead shall so notify Janssen in writing (the "ROFN Trigger Notice") and (b)
if Janssen notifies Gilead, within [*] after receiving a ROFN Trigger Notice
(the "ROFN Period"), that it desires to negotiate with Gilead with respect to
becoming Gilead's exclusive distributor of one or both Territory Combination
Products in such country, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for [*]
(or such longer period as agreed by the Parties) (the "Negotiation Period") an
amendment to this Agreement (and, if applicable, the Janssen Distributor
Agreement) pursuant to which such country would become a Janssen Country;
provided, however, that neither Party will be obligated to enter into such an
amendment. If, following receipt of a ROFN Trigger Notice with respect to a
country, (i) Janssen notifies Gilead, prior to the expiration of the ROFN
Period, that it does not desire to negotiate to become Gilead's exclusive
distributor in such country, (ii) the ROFN Period expires without Gilead's
receipt of a notification from Janssen that it desires to negotiate to become
Gilead's exclusive distributor for the Territory Combination Product in such
country or (iii) Janssen notifies Gilead, prior to the expiration of the ROFN
Period, that it desires to negotiate to become Gilead's exclusive distributor
for the Territory Combination Product in such country, but the Negotiation
Period expires before the Parties execute an amendment to this Agreement (and,
if applicable, the

Janssen Distributor Agreement) pursuant to which such country would become a
Janssen Country, then Gilead shall thereafter be free to engage a Third Party
Distributor to Distribute Territory Combination Products in such Gilead
Country.

6.6 Distribution and Related Matters.

6.6.1 Distribution Activities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Janssen Distributor Agreement, the Parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that Gilead (or its Affiliate or Sublicensee or Third
Party Distributor) shall have the right to Distribute each Territory
Combination Product in each country in the Territory (other than the Janssen
Countries). Subject to the Janssen Distributor Agreement, Gilead (or such
other Person) shall have the sole responsibility and right to fill orders with
respect to such Territory Combination Product in such country and shall have
the sole responsibility and right to distribute (or right to cause such other
Person to distribute) such Territory Combination Product and to perform
distribution activities with respect thereto, including inventory management
and control, warehousing and storage, order filling, invoicing, collection of
sales proceeds, determination and processing of charge-backs and rebates,
preparation of sales records and reports, customer relations and services, and
handling of returns (the "Distribution Activities"). Gilead shall not (i)
grant rights to conduct any Distribution Activities with respect to a
Territory Combination Product in any country to any Person other than its
Affiliates, Sublicensees, Distribution Subcontractors or Third Party
Distributors, (ii) sell or permit its Affiliates, Sublicensees or Third Party
Distributors to sell any Territory Combination Product in a country outside of
the European Union if Gilead (or such Affiliate, Sublicensee or Third Party
Distributor) has reason to believe that such Territory Combination Product
will be exported from such country to any Janssen Country, or (iii) export or
have exported (other than pursuant to the Janssen Distributor Agreement), or
permit its Affiliates, Sublicensees or Third Party Distributors to export, any
Territory Combination Product from any country outside of the European Union
if Gilead (or such Affiliate, Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor) has
reason to believe that such Territory Combination Product will be Distributed
(by Gilead or any other Person) in or to any Janssen Country without the
written consent of Janssen, unless refusing to so export the Territory
Combination Product would violate Applicable Law. Gilead shall perform (or
cause to be performed) the Distribution Activities in the Territory consistent
with Applicable Law. Janssen shall promptly forward (or cause its Affiliates
to forward) to Gilead (or its designee) any order(s) for the purchase of a
Territory Combination Product that are received by Janssen or any of its
Affiliates (excluding any orders for the purchase of a Territory Combination
Product in the Janssen Countries), provided that Janssen's failure to forward
any such order to Gilead (or its designee) shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement unless such failure constitutes willful misconduct.

6.6.2 First Expiration, First Out. The Selling Party shall Distribute (and
shall cause its Affiliates and Distribution Subcontractors to Distribute) all
Territory Combination Product on a first expiration, first out (FEFO) basis.

6.7 Marketing Materials.

1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





6.7.1.5 Territory Complera. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as of the
Restatement Effective Date, they have agreed on a set of core messages with
respect to Territory Complera, which core messages shall serve as a basis for
the promotion of Territory Complera to physicians (the "Complera Key Selling
Messages"), and from time to time the Parties may develop and propose to each
other any updates to the Complera Key Selling Messages, which updates shall be
mutually agreed by the Parties. If the Parties cannot reach agreement with
respect to a given update to the Complera Key Selling Messages, the Parties
shall (on a country-by-country basis if and to the extent appropriate) refer
any disputed issues to the Executives for resolution pursuant to Section 20.6.
If the Executives are unable to reach agreement with respect thereto within
the Executives Review Period, neither Party shall be obligated to use such
updated Complera Key Selling Message, but each Party shall be permitted to use
such updated Complera Key Selling Message (and include such updated Complera
Key Selling Message in its Local Promotional Materials) if such updated
Complera Key Selling Message is consistent with both (a) the Product Label for
Territory Complera and (b) Applicable Law. This Section 6.7.1.1 shall be
effective until the second anniversary of the first date on which the First
Commercial Sale of the Territory R/F/TAF Product has occurred in all Major
Market Countries.

6.7.1.6 Territory R/F/TAF Product. Before the First Commercial Sale of the
Territory R/F/TAF Product in a Major Market Country, Gilead shall develop and
propose to Janssen a set of core messages with respect to the Territory
R/F/TAF Product, which core messages shall serve as a basis for the promotion
of the Territory R/F/TAF Product in such countries to physicians (as updated
from time to time, the "R/F/TAF Product Key Selling Messages" and, together
with the Complera Key Selling Messages, the "Key Selling Messages"). From time
to time, Gilead may develop and propose to Janssen updates to the R/F/TAF
Product Key Selling Messages. All R/F/TAF Product Key Selling Messages,
including updates thereto, shall be consistent with the Product Label for the
Territory R/F/TAF Product and scientifically accurate. At Janssen's request,
the Parties shall discuss such proposed or updated R/F/TAF Product Key Selling
Messages and Gilead shall consider Janssen's comments. If the Parties cannot
reach agreement with respect to any such R/F/TAF Product Key Selling Message
or any updates thereto, the Parties may refer any disputed issues to the
Executives for resolution pursuant to Section 20.6. If the Executives are
unable to reach agreement with respect thereto within the Executives Review
Period, Gilead shall have final decision-making authority with respect to such
matter.

6.7.2 Local Promotional Materials. Except as otherwise provided in the Co-
Detailing LOA's, all advertising and promotional materials, if any, to be used
in connection with the marketing and promotion, including Detailing, of a
Territory Combination Product in a given country in the Territory (such
advertising and promotional materials for each such country, the "Local
Promotional Materials") shall be developed by the Selling Party at its cost
and expense. All Local Promotional Materials shall be (a) consistent with the
most recent Key Selling Messages (if any) made effective under Section 6.7.1.1
or Section 6.7.1.2, as applicable, for the applicable Territory Combination
Product; provided, however, that Janssen shall not be required to conform its
Local Promotional Materials to any Key Selling Messages to the extent that
Janssen reasonably believes that such Key Selling Messages are inconsistent
with the Product

Label for the applicable Territory Combination Product or that conforming its
Local Promotional Materials to such Key Selling Messages would be inconsistent
with Applicable Law (for clarity, with respect to Section 6.7.1.1, this clause
(a) shall apply during the period Section 6.7.1.1 is effective (as described
in the last sentence thereof) and after such period), (b) consistent with the
Product Label for the applicable Territory Combination Product, (c) consistent
with Applicable Law and (d) in the case of Janssen, consistent with the
branding guidance provided by Gilead from time to time, with deviation solely
to the extent required by Applicable Law; provided, however, that Janssen
shall not be required to conform its Local Promotional Materials to any such
branding guidance to the extent that Janssen reasonably believes that such
branding guidance is inconsistent with the Product Label for the applicable
Territory Combination Product or that conforming its Local Promotional
Materials to such branding guidance would be inconsistent with Applicable Law.
Any Local Promotional Materials for any Janssen Country in which Gilead (or
its applicable Affiliate, Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor) is the MA
Holder shall be approved by Gilead in writing prior to their use. In the event
of any updates to the applicable Key Selling Messages, or if Gilead notifies
Janssen in writing of a modification to Gilead's applicable branding guidance,
each Party shall promptly review and update its Local Promotional Materials,
if any, to conform such materials thereto. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 6.7.2, each Party (and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Third
Party Distributors) shall use the applicable Local Promotional Materials (and
only the Local Promotional Materials) for a given country (as developed in
accordance with this Section 6.7), together with Product Label for the
applicable Territory Combination Product in such country, in marketing and
promoting, including Detailing, a Territory Combination Product in such
country; provided, however, that subject to the foregoing, the Selling Party
shall have the right to position the applicable Territory Combination Product
within its HIV product portfolio in its sole discretion in the countries for
which it is the Selling Party.

6.7.3 Regulatory Approval for Promotional Materials. For clarity, in any
interactions with a Regulatory Authority with respect to the Local Promotional
Materials, the allocation of the Parties' rights and responsibilities shall be
as set forth in Section 4.4, except as otherwise provided in the Co-Detailing
LOA's, or in any other written agreement between the Parties.

6.7.4 Compliance with Applicable Law. The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge
that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.7, neither Party (nor
its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Third Party Distributors) shall be required
to market a Territory Combination Product utilizing Local Promotional
Materials which such Party believes in good faith do not comply with
Applicable Law.

6.7.5 Promotional Materials in Co-Detailing Countries. With respect to each
country listed in Annex FF in which Janssen is engaged in Detailing a
Territory Combination Product, Gilead shall provide Janssen with copies of
promotional materials to be used for Detailing in the applicable country,
which materials (and the timelines for providing them) are specified in the
applicable Co-Detailing LOA. Gilead may redact from such materials any
information relating to Gilead products other than the Territory Combination
Products.

6.8 Selection and Use of Trademarks. The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge
that Gilead has selected COMPLERA® and EVIPLERA®, and other Trademarks
relating thereto, for use in connection with the Exploitation of Territory
Complera by the Parties. Gilead shall have the right to select any other
Combination Product Trademarks, provided that any such Combination Product
Trademark shall comply with Applicable Law. Gilead shall not, and shall not
permit its Affiliates to, select or use, as a Combination Product Trademark,
any Trademark that is identical to or likely to cause confusion with the
Product Trademark for any prescription pharmaceutical product of Janssen or
any of its Affiliates or that violates any Applicable Law. Janssen shall not,
and shall not permit its Affiliates to, use, in connection with any RPV
Product, any Trademark that is identical to or likely to cause confusion with
any of the Combination Product Trademarks or the Product Trademarks for any
prescription pharmaceutical product of Gilead or any of its Affiliates or that

Double Agent Products. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party covenants
that it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (a) act in good faith in
setting the price and discounts for such Party's Single Agent Product(s) and
(in the case of Gilead) Double Agent Products in the Field in the Territory
and (b) not directly or indirectly manipulate pricing or discounting
arrangements of such Party's Single Agent Product(s) or (in the case of

8.1.11 The Parties shall work in good faith to negotiate and execute (or cause
to be executed) within sixty (60) days after the Restatement Effective Date a
new supply agreement with respect to supply of RPV for the Territory
Combination Products. The "RPV Supply Agreement" shall mean (a) with respect
to Supplied RPV for Territory Complera and, if and only to the extent mutually
agreed by the Parties in writing, the Territory R/F/TAF Product, unless and

from Gilead for such RPV for use in any Development Activities with respect to
Territory Combination Products that Gilead is permitted to perform under
Article 3 and as required to supply Janssen with Territory Combination Product
for Development purposes pursuant to Section 8.2. In lieu of such supply,
Gilead may use existing quantities of RPV previously supplied under the RPV
Supply Agreement for such activities ("RPV Supply Agreement Quantities").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the RPV Supply Agreement, Gilead
shall have the right to use such quantities of RPV in conducting such
activities. If specifically supplied for such purposes, such RPV shall be

Commence prior to the Safety Database Closing Date with respect to the
applicable Territory Combination Product, [*], and (b) for use in Combination
Product Clinical Trials that Commence after the Safety Database Closing Date
with respect to the applicable Territory Combination Product, at [*]. If, in
the alternative, Gilead uses RPV Supply Agreement Quantities, then the
applicable adjustment set forth in Section 8.1.3 shall apply. For clarity, the
RPV Supply Agreement shall apply to the supply of RPV under this Section
8.1.2, except that in the case of a conflict with respect to the pricing of
such RPV for such purposes, this Agreement shall control.

current needs of Gilead and its Affiliates (including contractual obligations
to Third Parties) for Territory Combination Product to be used in clinical
trials, on a pro-rata basis based on the quantity reasonably requested by
Janssen and the good faith forecasted requirements of Gilead and/or its
Affiliates (taking into consideration any contractual obligations to Third
Parties) for use in clinical trials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event of any such shortage, Gilead shall have no obligation to reallocate or
otherwise divert any manufacturing capacity or supply of the Territory
Combination Product from (A) the Combination Product Clinical Trials that are
necessary or reasonably expected to be necessary to obtain or maintain
Marketing Approval(s) of the Territory Combination Products (including any
bioequivalence studies or Post-Approval Commitment Studies), (B) any clinical
trial conducted by Gilead or its Affiliates or any Third Party with respect to
the Territory Combination Product for which Gilead has already committed to
supply quantities of the Territory Combination Products, provided that such
clinical trial has already commenced at the time of Janssen's request, or (C)
the commercial supply of the Territory Combination Product. Janssen covenants
to Gilead that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Third Party
distributors not to, make any use of the Territory Combination Product
provided by Gilead to Janssen under this Section 8.3 other than use by Janssen
solely in the Combination Product Clinical Trials permitted under this
Agreement. At the request of either Party, the Parties will discuss in good
faith a supplement to the Master Clinical Trial Material Agreement to cover
the supply of Territory Combination Product for Combination Product Clinical
Trials by Gilead to Janssen hereunder.

8.4 Additional Requirements. In the event that Applicable Law or a Regulatory
Authority in the Territory imposes, with respect to the Manufacture of a
Territory Combination Product (or TDF, TAF, FTC or the Supplied RPV contained
therein) for sale or distribution in one or more countries in the Territory, a
requirement that is not imposed by any of the EMA, the European Commission and
the FDA with respect to the Manufacture of such Territory Combination Product
(or such component) for sale or distribution in the European Union or United
States, as applicable (an "Additional Requirement"), the Selling Party for
such country that imposes the Additional Requirement shall notify the non-
Selling Party of such Additional Requirement. The Parties shall consider the
relative costs and benefits of complying with such

Additional Requirement and discuss whether, how and when to implement such
Additional Requirement in order to obtain or maintain Regulatory Approvals for
such Territory Combination Product in the Field in the applicable
country(ies). In the event that the Parties determine to implement such
Additional Requirement, the Parties shall establish an implementation plan for
such Additional Requirement. Either Party's obligation hereunder or under any
Ancillary Agreement to comply with any Additional Requirement, and the
allocation between the Parties of costs to be incurred pursuant to such
obligations, shall be solely as agreed under such plan. In the event the
Selling Party for a country fails to notify the non-Selling Party of any
Additional Requirement imposed by such country pursuant to this Section 8.4,
the non-Selling Party shall not be liable hereunder or under any Ancillary
Agreement for any failure to comply with such Additional Requirement and such
a failure shall not constitute a default hereunder or under any Ancillary
Agreement.

in such country, as necessary or reasonably expected to be necessary to, and
for the sole purpose of allowing Gilead (or its Affiliates, Third Party
Distributors or Sublicensees, as applicable) to, obtain and maintain
Regulatory Approvals for such Territory Combination Product in the Field in
such country or to comply with Applicable Law. Within ten (10) Business Days
following Gilead's request, Janssen shall deliver to Gilead an executed Right

clarity, such Rights of Reference granted to Gilead under this Section 9.2.1
shall be to the entire item of Janssen Regulatory Documentation (not portions
thereof) and shall include those listed as items 1 through 3 (in the case of
Territory Complera) or 4 through 6 (in the case of the Territory R/F/TAF
Product) in Annex II. Janssen agrees to provide any required signed statement
to that effect in accordance with the applicable Regulatory Authority's
position on authorization to cross reference. Such Right of Reference granted
under this Section 9.2.1 shall be paid-up, perpetual and non-exclusive upon
the expiration of this Agreement with respect to the applicable country as
provided in Section 19.1.

9.2.2 To Janssen. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
any Ancillary Agreements, with respect to any Janssen Country for which
Janssen (or its Affiliate or Third Party Distributor) is the MA Holder with
respect to a Territory Combination Product, Gilead (including on behalf of its
Affiliates) hereby grants, and shall cause its (sub)licensees and Third Party
distributors for its Single Agent Products and Double Agent Products, as
applicable, to grant, to Janssen (and its Affiliates or Third Party
Distributors, as applicable), in Gilead's (or its Affiliate's or
(sub)licensee's or Third Party distributor's, as applicable) capacity as the

each case in the Field in such country, a non-exclusive Right of Reference,

pursuant to Section 9.3, with regard to the Gilead Regulatory Documentation
for, (a) with respect to Territory Complera, Truvada, FTC Single Agent Product
or TDF Single Agent Product and (b) with respect to Territory R/F/TAF Product,

request, Gilead shall deliver to Janssen an executed Right of Reference letter
with respect to any Right of Reference granted herein. For clarity, such
Rights of Reference granted to Janssen under this Section 9.2.2 shall be to
the entire item of Gilead Regulatory Documentation (not portions thereof) and
shall include those listed as items 7 through 9 (in the case of Territory
Complera) or 10 through 12 (in the case of the Territory R/F/TAF Product) in
Annex II. Gilead agrees to provide any required signed statement to that
effect in accordance with the applicable Regulatory Authority's position on
authorization to cross reference. Such Right of Reference granted under this
Section 9.2.2 shall be paid-up, perpetual and non-exclusive upon the
expiration of this Agreement with respect to the applicable country as
provided in Section 19.1.

9.2.3 Data Exclusivity.

9.2.3.7 Gilead Compound Data Exclusivity. In the event that (i) Janssen or an
Affiliate of Janssen receives Marketing Approval for a Territory Combination
Product in a jurisdiction in which any applicable Gilead Compound Products
have not received Marketing Approval, and (ii) as a result of such Marketing
Approval of such Territory Combination Product, Janssen (or its Affiliate) is
the owner of Gilead Compound Data Exclusivity for any of TAF, TDF or FTC, then
Janssen (or its Affiliate, as the case may be) shall, at Gilead's request,
provide a letter to the applicable Regulatory Authority permitting Gilead
and/or Gilead's designee (including any Generic Licensee of Gilead with
respect to a Gilead Compound Product (provided that the scope of such letter
is consistent with the rights permitted to be granted under the granting
Party's Generic Exception)) to file for Marketing Approval of the applicable
Gilead Compound Product in that jurisdiction notwithstanding the Gilead
Compound Data Exclusivity. For clarity, the foregoing shall not be construed
as altering Janssen's rights to control commercialization of each Territory
Combination Product in the Janssen Countries or to control Marketing Approval
(including Rights of Reference thereto) of each Territory Combination Product
as provided for under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Janssen
shall not be required to take any action that would result in a loss of the
data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity associated with the grant of
Marketing Approval for a Territory Combination Product in all other respects.
"Gilead Compound Data Exclusivity" shall mean, with respect to any of TAF, TDF
or FTC, a right or protection, obtained in a jurisdiction, as a result of the
fact that a Territory Combination Product contains TAF, TDF or FTC, as
applicable, as an active ingredient that has not previously been approved in
such jurisdiction, which right or protection provides marketing exclusivity
that prevents the Regulatory Authority in such jurisdiction from accepting a
Drug Approval Application (whether new or abbreviated), submitted by a Person
other than the MA Holder for such Territory Combination Product, of the
applicable Gilead Compound Product. The rights afforded to Gilead under this
Section 9.2.3.1 shall survive termination or the expiration of this Agreement.

9.2.3.8 RPV Data Exclusivity. In the event that (i) Gilead or an Affiliate or
Sublicensee of Gilead receives Marketing Approval for a Territory Combination
Product in a jurisdiction in which any applicable RPV Products have not
received Marketing Approval, and (ii) as a result of such Marketing Approval
of such Territory Combination Product, Gilead (or its Affiliate or
Sublicensee) is the owner of RPV Data Exclusivity, then Gilead (or its
Affiliate or Sublicensee, as the case may be) shall, at Janssen's request,
provide a

letter to the applicable Regulatory Authority permitting Janssen and/or
Janssen's designee (including any Generic Licensee of Janssen with respect to
an RPV Product (provided that the scope of such letter is consistent with the
rights permitted to be granted under the granting Party's Generic Exception))
to file for Marketing Approval of the applicable RPV Product in that
jurisdiction notwithstanding the RPV Data Exclusivity. For clarity, the
foregoing shall not be construed as altering Gilead's rights to control
commercialization of each Territory Combination Product in the Gilead
Countries or to control Marketing Approval (including Rights of Reference
thereto) of each Territory Combination Product as provided for under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Gilead shall not be required to take
any action that would result in a loss of the data exclusivity and marketing
exclusivity associated with the grant of Marketing Approval for a Territory
Combination Product in all other respects. "RPV Data Exclusivity" shall mean a
right or protection, obtained in a jurisdiction, as a result of the fact that
a Territory Combination Product contains RPV as an active ingredient that has
not previously been approved in such jurisdiction, which right or protection
provides marketing exclusivity that prevents the Regulatory Authority in such
jurisdiction from accepting a Drug Approval Application (whether new or
abbreviated), submitted by a Person other than the MA Holder for such
Territory Combination Product, of the applicable RPV Product. The rights
afforded to Janssen under this Section 9.2.3.2 shall survive termination or
the expiration of this Agreement.

9.3 Sublicenses.

9.3.3 For Manufacturing. Subject to Gilead's payment of amounts due to Janssen
under this Agreement, Gilead (and its Affiliates) shall have the right to
grant Third Party manufacturers (but excluding any Generic Licensee, [*]) a
non-exclusive, royalty-free sublicense anywhere in the world, without the
right to further sublicense, under the licenses granted to Gilead in Section
9.1.2, for the sole purpose of Manufacturing any Territory Combination Product
(but not the RPV therein) for supply to Gilead or its Affiliates or
Sublicensees, or Janssen or its Affiliates pursuant to the Janssen Distributor
Agreement, for Exploitation of such Territory Combination Product in the Field
(including sale by Gilead, its Affiliates or Sublicensees, or by Janssen or
its Affiliates, to a Third Party Distributor) in accordance with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, provided that Gilead shall provide to
its Third Party manufacturers only such Janssen Confidential Information and
Janssen Regulatory Documentation as is required in order for such Third Party
manufacturer to Manufacture the applicable Territory Combination Product in
accordance with GMP.

9.3.4 For Development or Commercialization Activities. Subject to Gilead's
payment of amounts due to Janssen under this Agreement, Gilead (and its
Affiliates) shall have the right to grant any Third Party(ies) (other than a
Generic Licensee of Gilead) a sublicense (which may, at the election of
Gilead, be non-exclusive or exclusive, to the extent consistent with Gilead's
rights hereunder) in any country in the Territory, without the right to
further sublicense, under the licenses granted to Gilead in Section 9.1.1 in
the Field with respect to any Territory Combination Product in such country,
provided that either (i) such Third Party has the same rights with respect to
any of Gilead's Single Agent Products or Double Agent Products or another
pharmaceutical product of Gilead or its Affiliate, or (ii) Janssen provides
its written consent to such sublicense, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Gilead shall not have the right to grant any sublicense or further Right of
Reference under this Agreement in order to enable any Third Party to sell a
Combination Product (A) on a Generic Basis, or (B) in Region C under any
Product Trademark other than a Product Trademark Controlled by Gilead or an
Affiliate of Gilead.

9.3.5 Limitations on Third Party Distributors. Subject to the Janssen
Distributor Agreement, either Party may engage a Third Party Distributor to
sell in any country in which such Party is the Selling Party a Territory
Combination Product under this Agreement, but in Region C this right shall be
subject to each of the following: (i) such Third Party Distributor shall
purchase such Territory Combination Product in the form of Finished Product
from the applicable Party or its Affiliates, (ii) unless a Party obtains the
other Party's prior written approval, such Party or its Affiliate (or a Third
Party agent that is not engaged in the business of distribution or
manufacturing of pharmaceutical products) shall hold the Marketing Approval
for the applicable Territory Combination Product in the applicable country
under which such Third Party Distributor sells such Territory Combination
Product, and (iii) for clarity, (x) Gilead shall not grant to a Third Party
Distributor any access to any Confidential Information of Janssen or Janssen
Regulatory Documentation or afford any Right of Reference provided by Janssen
to such Third Party Distributor, in each case under this clause (iii)(x),
except with Janssen's prior written approval, and (y) Janssen shall not grant
to a Third Party Distributor any access to any Confidential Information of
Gilead or Gilead Regulatory Documentation or afford any Right of Reference
provided by Gilead to such Third Party Distributor, in each case under this
clause (iii)(y), except with Gilead's prior written approval. The term
"Finished Product" shall mean drug product in finished dosage forms.

9.3.6 To Affiliates. Either Party may grant sublicenses under any license
granted to it pursuant to Section 9.1 to any of its Affiliates. Either Party
may grant a further Right of Reference under any Right of Reference granted to
it pursuant to Section 9.2 to any of its Affiliates.

9.4 Trademark Licenses.

9.4.6 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement, Gilead hereby grants to Janssen a non-exclusive, royalty-free,

9.5.1 Third Party License Payments. [*].

9.5.2 Existing RPV License(s). Gilead acknowledges that it has received a
sublicense under this Article 9 with regard to certain Patents or Information
and Inventions that are subject to the terms and conditions of the Existing
RPV Licenses as applicable to Janssen's sublicensees thereunder and Gilead
agrees to comply with such terms and conditions as specified by Janssen in the
In-License Requirements established pursuant to this Section 9.5.

9.5.3 In-License Requirements. In order to ensure that Janssen is able to meet
its obligations under the Existing RPV Licenses as they relate to the
activities under this Agreement, and to ensure Gilead is clear with regard to
the requirements on Janssen in order to ensure such compliance, the Parties
have agreed upon those obligations, beyond those set forth herein, to which
Gilead shall be required to adhere in order to ensure such compliance (such
written terms, and any additional written terms the Parties agree upon in good
faith under Section 9.5.4, referred to herein the "Janssen In-License
Requirements"). The Janssen In-License Requirements effective as of the
Restatement Effective Date are attached as Annex W. In order to ensure that
Gilead is able to meet its obligations under any license agreements entered
into by Gilead pursuant to Section 9.5.4, the Parties will agree in good faith
upon written terms setting forth those obligations of such license agreements
beyond those obligations set forth herein to which Janssen shall be required
to adhere, and to ensure Janssen is clear with regard to such obligations
(such written terms referred to herein the "Gilead In-License Requirements").
The Parties will set forth the Gilead In-License Requirements in a separate
signed document.

9.5.4 Additional In-Licenses. In the event that a first Party determines that
there is a Patent or other intellectual property that is licensed to such
first Party or its Affiliates by a Third Party under a sublicensable license
agreement, which Patent or intellectual property is sublicensed to the other
Party hereunder (such as, in the case of Janssen as the first Party, the
Existing RPV Licenses) or for which such first Party has obligations to such
Third Party under such license agreement that would be, to the first Party's
good faith knowledge, triggered by any activities conducted hereunder by the
other Party (such as, in the case of Gilead, the Existing Gilead Licenses),
then such first Party shall promptly notify the other Party and the Parties
shall promptly thereafter negotiate and agree on and set forth in writing, (a)
either (i) in the case of such a license agreement of Janssen, an amendment to
the Janssen In-License Requirements, or (ii) in the case of such a license
agreement of Gilead, an amendment to the Gilead In-License Requirements; and
(b) an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that a sublicense to the
other Party is necessary. For clarity, upon entering into such amendment(s)
under this Section 9.5.4, the at-issue Third Party license agreement shall be
deemed an "In-License Agreement." Each Party shall only be bound by any In-
License Requirement on and after the date on which such In-License Requirement
has been disclosed to such Party and only for so long as such Party is a
sublicensee under the applicable In-License Agreement or conducting activities
in accordance with this Agreement that trigger the other Party's obligations
under the applicable In-License Agreement and only for so long as the In-
License Requirement is required by the applicable In-License Agreement. [*].
Upon the request of either Party, the other Party shall disclose to the
requesting Party the applicable financial terms of any Existing Gilead License
(in the case the requested Party is Gilead), any Existing RPV License (in the
case the requested

Party is Janssen) and any In-License Agreement of such requested Party entered
into after the Restatement Effective Date that would require the requesting
Party to pay a royalty or other monetary compensation after expiration of the
Agreement with respect to such country; provided that such request by the
requesting Party may be made no earlier [*].

9.5.5 Modifications or Amendments to any In-License Agreement. Modifications
or amendments to any In-License Agreement, including the Existing RPV Licenses
and the Existing Gilead Licenses, by a Party after the Restatement Effective
Date that would materially increase a Party's obligations under the In-License
Requirements shall not apply to the obligated Party unless and until such
first Party obtains the obligated Party's prior written approval. If a Party
modifies or amends any In-License Agreement in a manner that would require
modification of the In-License Requirements, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith modifications to the In-License Requirements in order to reflect
such modification or amendment, provided that such modification or amendment
complies with the preceding sentence, in which case the other Party shall not
unreasonably withhold its consent to such modifications or amendments to the
In-License Requirements.

9.5.6 Payments. [*].

9.6 Retained Rights. All (sub)license rights not specifically granted in this
Article 9 or elsewhere herein or in any Ancillary Agreements are expressly
reserved by each licensing Party (or its Affiliates). Any (sub)license granted
in this Article 9 which is not sublicensable, may be transferred or assigned
by the licensee Party only in connection with a permitted assignment of this
Agreement by such Party. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 9,
none of the licenses granted under this Agreement apply to Generic Combination
Product. For clarity, each Party and its Affiliates retains all rights under
any intellectual property Controlled by such Party (other than Controlled as a
result of the licenses granted in this Article 9) (a) to exercise any of its
rights under such Party's Generic Exception, including granting licenses to
Generic Licensees permitted thereunder, or any of its rights to conduct
clinical trials in accordance with this Agreement, and (b) to perform its
obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement.

Lost Supplied RPV. At the same time, Janssen shall issue to Gilead a credit

accountant regarding the Audit and will specify that the amounts paid by or to
the Auditing Party pursuant thereto were correct or, if incorrect, the amount
of any underpayment or overpayment.

10.8.4 If such independent public accounting firm's or other accountant's
report shows any underpayment, the paying Party shall remit to the other Party

such underpayment and (ii) if such underpayment exceeds [*] of the total
amount owed for the Calendar Year then being audited, the reasonable and
necessary fees and expenses of such independent public accounting firm or

(ii) [*] and (b) the maximum rate of interest permissible by Applicable Law.
The foregoing interest shall be due from the paying Party without any special
notice.

10.10 Tax Withholding.

10.10.1 A Party making payments to the other Party under this Agreement or the

10.10.2 Any tax required to be withheld on amounts payable under this
Agreement or the RPV Supply Agreement will promptly be paid by the applicable
paying Party on behalf of the other Party to the appropriate governmental
authority, and such paying Party will furnish the other Party with proof of
payment of such tax within sixty (60) days. Any such tax required to be
withheld shall be an expense of and borne by such other Party.

10.10.3 Janssen and Gilead shall cooperate with respect to all documentation
required by any taxing authority or reasonably requested by Janssen or Gilead
to secure a reduction in the rate of applicable withholding taxes.

10.10.4 If the applicable paying Party had a duty to withhold taxes in
connection with any payment it made to the other Party under this Agreement or
the RPV Supply Agreement but such paying Party failed to withhold, and such
taxes were assessed against and paid by such paying Party, then the other
Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such paying Party from and against
such taxes (including interest, but not including any related penalties). If
such paying Party makes a claim under this Section 10.10.4, it shall comply
with the obligations imposed by Section 10.10.2 as if such paying Party had
withheld taxes from a payment to the other Party.

Supply Agreement to an Affiliate or Third Party or grants to an Affiliate or
Third Party a sublicense hereunder, in each case in a manner that adversely
impacts the other Party economically due to increased withholding taxes on
amounts paid by such Party hereunder or under the RPV Supply Agreement, or
additional VAT taxes on the transfer of inventory hereunder or thereunder,
then such first Party shall pay to such other Party an amount equal to the
difference between the amount such other Party owes to the relevant tax
authority on payments received or paid hereunder or thereunder, or inventory
sold hereunder or thereunder, and the amount such other Party would have owed
to such tax authority had this Agreement or the RPV Supply Agreement not been
assigned or sublicensed to such Affiliate or Third Party.

good faith to discuss and develop mutually acceptable guidelines and
procedures for the investigation, exchange, receipt, recordation and
communication (as between the Parties and their Affiliates) of safety-related
information with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF Product, and to set forth
such guidelines and procedures in a written amendment to the Complera PVA or a
separate written agreement between the Parties (the Complera PVA as amended by
such amendment, or such separate written agreement (as it may be amended from
time to time) together with the Complera PVA, the "Pharmacovigilance
Agreement" or "PVA"). In connection with entering into any Third Party
Distributor Agreement, the Selling Party shall ensure that it and the
applicable Third Party Distributor enter into an appropriate pharmacovigilance
agreement consistent with the terms of the PVA. Gilead shall, at its expense,
maintain the global safety database with respect to the Territory Combination
Products.

13.2 Notification and Recall.

13.2.9 Notification. In the event that either Party becomes aware that any
governmental agency or authority has issued or requested a recall or market
withdrawal or taken similar action in connection with (a) a Combination
Product anywhere in the world, (b) in the case of Janssen, the RPV Single
Agent Product, if the reason for such field alert is reasonably likely to
affect a Territory Combination Product and Janssen has the right to make such
disclosure to Gilead or (c) in the case of Gilead, any of the Gilead Compound
Products, if the reason for such field alert is reasonably likely to affect a
Territory Combination Product and Gilead has the right to make such disclosure
to Janssen, or in the event that either Party determines that such a recall or
market withdrawal of a Territory Combination Product may be necessary or
advisable, such Party shall notify the other Party thereof by telephone within
twenty-four (24) hours after becoming aware of such request, action or
determination. Each Party shall also notify the other (i) if such Party issues
an FDA field alert or similar alert or foreign equivalent thereof (in which
case the Party issuing such field alert shall notify the other Party within
twenty-four (24) hours after the decision to issue such field alert, and prior
to notification of the applicable governmental agency or authority) with
respect to (x) a Territory Combination Product or (y) any of such Party's
Single Agent Product(s) (including, in the case of Janssen, any Other RPV
Product) or Double Agent Products in the Field, if the reason for such field
alert is reasonably likely to affect a Territory Combination Product and the
disclosing Party has the right to make such disclosure to the other Party, and
(ii) within twenty-four (24) hours after such Party's receipt of any
communication from any governmental agency or authority regarding a potential
recall or market withdrawal of a Territory Combination Product or any of such
Party's aforementioned products anywhere in the world.

13.2.10 Decision to Recall or Withdraw. Within a period of time reasonable
under the circumstances after the date of a notice given pursuant to the first
sentence of Section 13.2.1 that relates to, or otherwise has implications for,

Territory, for each country in the Territory, the Selling Party with respect
thereto shall recall or withdraw such Territory Combination Product in such
country if the Recall/Withdrawal Criteria (described below) are met with
respect to such country. In such a case, the Selling Party shall determine in
its reasonable judgment (i) the extent to which to conduct such recall or
withdrawal (where such determination shall be made by

1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





the Selling Party, in its reasonable judgment, based on the circumstances
(e.g., a discrete Manufacturing non-conformity would justify a recall with
respect to the applicable quantities of the applicable Territory Combination
Product, but not a market withdrawal of such Territory Combination Product
from such country)), (ii) the breadth, extent and level of customer to which
any such recall or withdrawal shall reach, (iii) the strategies and
notifications to be used, and (iv) other related matters with respect to the
conduct of such recall or withdrawal. The "Recall/Withdrawal Criteria" shall
be deemed to have been met in any country in the Territory if (A) the recall
or withdrawal is mandated by any Regulatory Authority, (B) the Selling Party
reasonably determines to recall or withdraw a Territory Combination Product,
or the non-Selling Party reasonably requests such recall or withdrawal in
writing, and such determination by the Selling Party, or such request by the
non-Selling Party, is made: (v) for failure of such Territory Combination
Product to meet the specifications therefor, (w) with a reasonable basis to
conclude that material harm to patients may occur in the absence of such
recall or withdrawal, (x) in the event the Manufacture of such Territory
Combination Product sold in such country does not comply with Applicable Law,
(y) on account of safety issues with respect to (1) such Territory Combination
Product or (2) any Single Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Product in the
Field, including in the event of a withdrawal of any Single Agent Product(s)
or Double Agent Product in the Field from markets in the European Union or the
United States for safety concerns, or (z) on account of a Regulatory Authority
mandating a withdrawal of any Single Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Product
in the Field from markets in the European Union or the United States or (C)
the applicable Territory Combination Product is recalled or withdrawn in the
applicable country(ies) in accordance with Section 13.2.3.

13.2.11 Product Withdrawal.

Section 13.2.3.2, at any time, Gilead may, for commercial reasons or otherwise
determine in its sole discretion, withdraw any Territory Combination Product
from the market in any Gilead Country that is not a Major Market Country (and
recall such Territory Combination Product in connection therewith, if
applicable), (b) at any time after the First Commercial Sale of the Territory
R/F/TAF Product has occurred in a Janssen Country, Janssen may, for commercial
reasons or otherwise, determine in its sole discretion to withdraw Territory
Complera from the market in such Janssen Country (and to recall Territory
Complera in connection therewith, if applicable), and (c) at any time after
Gilead has withdrawn the Territory R/F/TAF Product in a Major Market Country
pursuant to Section 13.2.2, Janssen may, for commercial reasons or otherwise,
determine in its sole discretion to withdraw the Territory R/F/TAF Product
from any Janssen Country (and to recall the Territory R/F/TAF Product in
connection therewith, if applicable). If the reason for such market withdrawal
is based on any of the Recall/Withdrawal Criteria (other than clause (C)
thereof), such withdrawal shall be conducted in accordance with Section
13.2.2. In all other cases of market withdrawal, the Selling Party shall, upon
receiving any necessary or appropriate approval from the applicable Regulatory
Authority(ies), cease selling (and cause its subdistributors and Third Party
Distributors, as applicable, to cease selling) the applicable Territory
Combination Product in the applicable country, and the Selling Party shall
determine whether, and if so how, to recall any of such Territory Combination
Product already on the market in such country.

described in clause (A) or clause (B) of the Recall/Withdrawal Criteria,
Gilead shall promptly notify Janssen in writing and the Parties shall discuss
in good faith such Gilead determination to withdraw the Territory R/F/TAF
Product. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on whether Gilead
may withdraw the Territory R/F/TAF Product from such country pursuant to
Section 13.2.2 or Section 13.2.3.1, either Party shall have the right to refer
such matter for resolution by the Alliance Managers pursuant to Section 20.6.

country or its applicable Affiliate (or in the case of a country in which a
Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor is the distributor in such country, the
Selling Party shall cause the Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor to
conduct such product recall or withdrawal) with reasonable cooperation from
the other Party, regardless of whether the other Party requested such

make a timely report of any matter relating to an actual or potential recall
or similar action to any government agency or take other action that it deems
appropriate or required by Applicable Law.

13.3 Recall Expenses. Each Party (the "Responsible Party") shall bear any and
all Recall Expenses with respect to any Party-Specific Recall/Withdrawal of
such Party. Any Recall Expenses that are not exclusively borne by one of the
Parties pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be borne by the Parties in
accordance with their applicable Average Respective Percentages with respect
to the Territory. In addition, if any existing quantity of Territory
Combination Product is rendered unusable as a result of a recall or withdrawal

to Recalled Product supplied by Gilead pursuant to the Janssen Distributor
Agreement, for any amounts invoiced by Gilead to Janssen for such Recalled

Recalled Product.

13.4 Recall Records. Each Party shall maintain records of all sales, in

1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





a. Gilead, through patent attorneys or agents of its choice, shall have the
first right, but not the obligation, at its sole expense, to prepare, file,
prosecute and maintain applications for Patents in the Territory claiming the
Joint Know-How, to the extent that such Joint Know-How is (x) related to a
Combination Product and (y) would have utility with regard to any Gilead
Compound Product and would not have utility with regard to any RPV Product
("Gilead-Controlled Combination Product Joint Patents") and to obtain,
prosecute, and maintain such Gilead-Controlled Combination Product Joint
Patents in the name of both Parties as assignees throughout the Territory.
Gilead shall provide (or shall cause its foreign agents to provide) to Janssen
copies of all written official communications correspondence between Gilead or
any of its Affiliates or their respective patent counsel and the applicable
patent office relating to the prosecution or maintenance of such Gilead-
Controlled Combination Product Joint Patents, and Janssen shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to provide substantive review and comment on
any such correspondence. Without limitation of the foregoing, Janssen shall
have the right to request that Gilead file, prosecute and maintain any Gilead-
Controlled Combination Product Joint Patent in a particular country. If Gilead
declines in writing to do so, or otherwise fails to initiate any such
requested action with respect to such Gilead-Controlled Combination Product
Joint Patent within sixty (60) days after receiving a request (or to
thereafter diligently pursue such action), Janssen shall have the right, but
not the obligation, at its sole cost and expense, through counsel of its
choosing, to pursue such action with respect to such Gilead-Controlled
Combination Product Joint Patent.

b. Janssen, through patent attorneys or agents of its choice, shall have the
first right, but not the obligation, at its sole expense, to prepare, file,
prosecute and maintain applications for Patents in the Territory claiming the
Joint Know-How, to the extent that such Joint Know-How is (x) related to a
Combination Product and (y) would have utility with regard to any RPV Product
and would not have utility with regard to any Gilead Compound Product
("Janssen-Controlled Combination Product Joint Patents") and to obtain,
prosecute, and maintain such Janssen-Controlled Combination Product Joint
Patents in the name of both Parties as assignees throughout the Territory.
Janssen shall provide (or shall cause its foreign agents to provide) to Gilead
copies of all written official communications correspondence between Janssen
or any of its Affiliates or their respective patent counsel and the applicable
patent office relating to the prosecution or maintenance of such Janssen-
Controlled Combination Product Joint Patents and Gilead shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to provide substantive review and comment on any such
correspondence. Without limitation of the foregoing, Gilead shall have the
right to request that Janssen file, prosecute and maintain any Janssen-
Controlled Combination Product Joint Patent in a particular country. If
Janssen declines in writing to do so, or otherwise fails to initiate any such
requested action with respect to such Janssen-Controlled Combination Product
Joint Patent within sixty (60) days after receiving a request (or to
thereafter diligently pursue such action), Gilead shall have the right, but
not the obligation, at its sole cost and expense, through counsel of its
choosing, to pursue such action with respect to such Janssen-Controlled
Combination Product Joint Patent.

c. Gilead and Janssen shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, to assist and cooperate with one another in filing, prosecuting
and maintaining the Joint Patents under this Section 14.2.3.1 and the
reasonable costs and

1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





expenses of such assistance and cooperation shall be allocated as costs and
expenses are otherwise allocated under this Section 14.2.3.1.

14.2.6.8 Other Joint Patents. In the event that either Party desires to
prepare and have filed any Patent application in the Territory claiming the
Joint Know-How to the extent that such Joint Know-How is either (A) not
related to a Combination Product or (B) not covered by Section 14.2.3.1a or
Section 14.2.3.1b above, then in either case ((A) or (B)), such Party shall
propose such filing to the other Party and the Parties shall discuss and agree
in writing on which Party shall take responsibility for preparing and filing
the Patent application and the allocation as between the Parties of costs and
expenses related to such Joint Patent application. In the event that the
Parties fail to reach agreement that such Patent application should be filed,
neither Party may file or cause to be filed such Patent application. In the
event that the Parties agree that a Patent application for a Joint Patent
Covering such Joint Know-How should be filed, the Party designated to lead
such application process (the "Lead Patent Party") shall have the sole right
and obligation, in consultation with the non-Lead Patent Party, to prepare,
file, prosecute, maintain and take any other actions as directed by the
Parties with respect to such Joint Patent in the name of both Parties as the
assignees in such countries as the Parties shall direct, and the costs and
expenses with respect thereto shall be shared by the Parties as agreed
pursuant to this Section 14.2.3.2. The Lead Patent Party shall keep the other
Party advised of the status of Joint Patent filings pursuant to this Section
14.2.3.2 and shall provide (or shall cause its foreign agents to provide)
copies of all written official communications correspondence between such Lead
Patent Party or any of its Affiliates or their respective patent counsel and
the applicable patent office relating to the prosecution or maintenance of
such Joint Patents. For the avoidance of doubt, the Lead Patent Party may
elect to use outside patent counsel for the filing, prosecution and
maintenance of the Joint Patents. The non-Lead Patent Party may engage outside
patent counsel, at its expense, to review any filings to be made with respect
to any Joint Patent pursuant to this Section 14.2.3.2. The non-Lead Patent
Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assist and cooperate with the
Lead Patent Party in filing, prosecuting and maintaining the Joint Patents
pursuant to this Section 14.2.3.2. Costs and expenses with respect to such
assistance shall be shared by the Parties as agreed pursuant to this Section
14.2.3.2.

14.2.6.9 Without limitation of Section 14.1.5, each Party shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and their respective employees and agents to, reasonably
cooperate, by the execution of documents and otherwise, to vest co-ownership
of the Joint Patents in one another.

14.2.7 Extensions. Gilead may file and prosecute to obtain extensions of the
Gilead Patents and the Gilead-Controlled Combination Product Joint Patents.
Janssen may file and prosecute to obtain extensions of the Janssen Patents and
the Janssen-Controlled Combination Product Joint Patents. The Lead Patent
Party with respect to any other Joint Patents may file and prosecute to obtain
extensions of such Joint Patents. The foregoing rights shall apply in any
country in which such extensions are available and each Party may exercise its
rights in this Section 14.2.4 in its sole discretion. Each Party shall provide
such assistance as may reasonably be required to obtain such extensions.

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





14.2.8 Orange Book. Gilead shall have sole discretion to determine which (i)
Gilead Patents, including Patents Covering Gilead-Owned Collaboration
Inventions, if any, (ii) Janssen Patents, including Patents Covering Janssen-
Owned Collaboration Inventions, if any, and (iii) Joint Patents, if any, shall
be listed in the "Orange Book" in the U.S., or any analogous or similar
listing in the Territory, with respect to a Territory Combination Product in
the Field; provided, however, that, in the case of the Janssen Patents and
Joint Patents, Gilead shall consult with Janssen in advance, afford Janssen a
reasonable opportunity to comment and consider in good faith any comments made
by Janssen in good faith with regard to such determination.

14.3 Liability for Prosecution and Maintenance. Each Party acknowledges that
the Party responsible for prosecution and maintenance of Patents licensed or
co-owned under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (the "Prosecution
and Maintenance") does not guarantee the issuance, validity, or enforceability
of any such Patent or any claim resulting from its efforts hereunder. Neither
Party shall have any liability to the other Party for any negligent acts or
misconduct of outside counsel utilized in connection with the Prosecution and
Maintenance. The foregoing provisions of this Section 14.3 are without
prejudice to either Party's potential liability for breach of its obligations
under Section 14.1 or 14.2.

14.4 Enforcement of Patents. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party
in writing of any alleged or threatened Infringement (as defined in Section
14.4.4) of which it becomes aware.

14.4.7 Effect on In-License Agreements. In the event that any Gilead Patents
(in the case of Gilead) or Janssen Patents (in the case of Janssen) are
subject to an In-License Agreement and such In-License Agreement would
restrict or impair the exercise of the other Party of its step-in rights set
forth in this Section 14.4 or Section 14.5, then at the request of the step-in
Party (which request may only be made if and when such step-in Party intends
to exercise such step-in rights), Gilead (in the case of the Gilead Patents)
or Janssen (in the case of the Janssen Patents) shall use good faith efforts
(a) to reasonably enable such other Party to exercise its such step-in rights,
or (b) to achieve an alternate resolution to the exercise of the other Party's
step-in rights, provided, however, that the Parties agree that such good faith
efforts shall not require Gilead (in the case of the Gilead Patents) or
Janssen (in the case of the Janssen Patents) to offer further compensation to
a Third Party.

14.4.8 Janssen Patents. As between the Parties, Janssen shall have, with
respect to the Major Market Countries, the first right and option, and with
respect to the remaining countries in the Territory, the sole right and
option, at its sole expense, in each case, to respond to any Infringement (as
defined in Section 14.4.4) with respect to any Janssen Patent, including
Patents Covering the Janssen-Owned Collaboration Inventions, by appropriate
steps, including by filing an infringement suit or taking other similar
action. With respect to the Major Market Countries, in the event that Janssen
fails to, within forty (40) days following notice of such Infringement, or
earlier notifies Gilead in writing of its intent not to, file an infringement
suit or other similar action against the infringer with respect to at least
one claim of one Janssen Patent, Gilead shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to do so at Gilead's sole cost and expense, the foregoing provided
that: (i) Janssen has the legal right to allow Gilead to take such steps to



101

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

remove such Infringement, including considering any contractual obligations
Janssen may have to Third Parties; (ii) any such steps to respond to such
Infringement by Gilead shall only be with respect to claims of Janssen Patents
that are directed to a composition-of-matter of RPV alone or in combination
with TDF, TAF or FTC or the use in the Field of RPV alone or in combination
with TDF, TAF or FTC; and (iii) to the extent that Gilead undertakes steps to
remove such Infringement, Gilead shall indemnify Janssen and its Indemnified
Persons as set forth in Section 18.5 (and Janssen shall have no obligations of
indemnity under Article 18 arising from such enforcement). In the event that
Gilead exercises such right, Gilead shall not settle any infringement suit or
similar action without the prior written consent of Janssen, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that Janssen may in its
sole discretion withhold its consent with respect to any settlement that
involves an admission of invalidity or unenforceability of any Janssen Patent.
The Party not bringing the suit or action shall provide, at such Party's own
expense, reasonable assistance to the Party bringing the suit or action,
including providing access to relevant documents and other evidence in its
possession and control (to the extent it is able to do so without violation of
any Third Party agreement), making its employees available at reasonable
business hours, and joining the action to the extent necessary to allow the
Party bringing the suit or action to maintain the suit or action. In the event
of a conflict between Janssen's rights under its Generic Exception and this
Section 14.4.2, such rights under Janssen's Generic Exception shall control.

14.4.9 Gilead Patents. As between the Parties, Gilead shall have, with respect
to Major Market Countries, the first right and option, and with respect to the
remaining countries in the Territory, the sole right and option, at its sole
expense, to respond to any Infringement (as defined in Section 14.4.4) with
respect to any Gilead Patent, including Patents Covering the Gilead-Owned
Collaboration Inventions, by appropriate steps, including by filing an
infringement suit or taking other similar action. With respect to Major Market
Countries, in the event that Gilead fails to, within forty (40) days following
notice of such Infringement, or earlier notifies Janssen in writing of its
intent not to, file an infringement suit or other similar action against the
infringer with respect to at least one claim of one Gilead Patent, Janssen
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to do so at Janssen's sole cost
and expense, the foregoing provided that: (i) Gilead has the legal right to
allow Janssen to take such steps to remove such Infringement, including
considering any contractual obligations Gilead may have to Third Parties; (ii)
any such steps to respond to such Infringement by Janssen shall only be with
respect to claims of Gilead Patents that are directed to a composition-of-
matter of TDF, TAF or FTC alone or in combination with RPV or the use in the
Field of TDF, TAF or FTC alone or in combination with RPV; and (iii) to the
extent that Janssen undertakes steps to remove such Infringement, Janssen
shall indemnify Gilead and its Indemnified Persons as set forth in Section
18.5 (and Gilead shall have no obligations of indemnity under Article 18
arising from such enforcement). In the event that Janssen exercises such
right, Janssen shall not settle any infringement suit or similar action
without the prior written consent of Gilead, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that Gilead may in its sole
discretion withhold its consent with respect to any settlement that involves
an admission of invalidity or unenforceability of any Gilead Patent. The Party
not bringing the suit or action shall provide, at such Party's own expense,
reasonable assistance to the Party bringing the suit or action, including
providing access to relevant documents and other evidence in its possession
and

control (to the extent it is able to do so without violation of any Third
Party agreement), making its employees available at reasonable business hours,
and joining the action to the extent necessary to allow the Party bringing the
suit or action to maintain such suit or action. In the event of a conflict
between Gilead's rights under its Generic Exception and this Section 14.4.3,
such rights under Gilead's Generic Exception shall control.

14.4.10 For purposes of this Section 14.4, (i) "Infringement" shall mean
infringement or potential infringement of any Janssen Patent, Gilead Patent or
Joint Patent by the actions of a Third Party in connection with an Combination
Product or Other Combination Product (an "Infringing Combination Product")
where such infringement or potential infringement relates to the Exploitation
of such Combination Product or Other Combination Product in the Territory,
(ii) "Other Infringement" shall mean infringement or potential infringement of
any Joint Patent by the actions of a Third Party in connection with any
product that is not an Infringing Combination Product, (an "Other Infringing
Product") and (iii) "other similar action" shall include responses to
paragraph (iv) certifications under the United States Drug Price Competition
and Patent Term Restoration Act (also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) (a
"Paragraph (iv) Certification") or a Notice of Allegation, which Paragraph
(iv) Certification or Notice of Allegation relates to any Gilead Patent or
Janssen Patent and results from an attempt to market (A) in the case of an
Infringing Combination Product, a Generic Combination Product or (B) in the
case of an Other Infringing Product, a generic version thereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that infringement of a
Gilead Patent or a Janssen Patent, as the case may be, other than by an
Infringing Combination Product, is outside the scope of this Agreement and
shall not create any rights or impose any obligations on the Parties
hereunder, including any right or obligation to take actions to respond to
such infringement.

14.4.11 Joint Patents.

14.4.11.1 Right to Respond to Infringements. As between the Parties, Gilead,
on behalf of and in the name of both Parties as joint owners, shall have the
first right and option, at its sole expense, to respond to any Infringement
with respect to any Joint Patent by appropriate steps, including filing an
infringement suit or taking other similar action, provided that Gilead shall
promptly notify Janssen of such Infringement, consult with Janssen, and
consider Janssen's recommended actions, regarding choice of outside counsel
and development of litigation strategy regarding any such suit or other
action. Gilead shall incur no liability to Janssen as a consequence of such
litigation or any unfavorable decision resulting therefrom, including any
decision holding such Joint Patent invalid or unenforceable. In the event that
Gilead fails to file an infringement suit or other similar action with respect
to any Infringement of any Joint Patent within forty (40) days following
notice of such Infringement, or notifies Janssen that it will not take action
with respect to such Infringement, then Janssen shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to take action with respect to such Infringement at Janssen's
sole cost and expense. The Party not bringing the suit or action shall
provide, at such Party's own expense, reasonable assistance to the Party
bringing the suit or action, including providing access to relevant documents
and other evidence in its possession and control, to the extent it is able to
do so without violation of any Third Party agreement, making its employees
available at

reasonable business hours, and joining the action to the extent necessary to
allow the Party to maintain such suit or action.

14.4.11.2 Right to Respond to Other Infringements Related to RPV Products Not
Including TDF, TAF or FTC. Janssen, on behalf of and in the name of both
Parties as joint owners, shall have the sole right and option, at its sole
expense, to respond to any Other Infringement with respect to any Joint Patent
to the extent that such Other Infringement relates to any RPV Product that
does not contain TDF, TAF or FTC by appropriate steps, including filing an
infringement suit or taking other similar action. Janssen shall incur no
liability to Gilead as a consequence of such litigation or any unfavorable
decision resulting therefrom, including any decision holding such Joint Patent
invalid or unenforceable. Gilead, at Janssen's expense, shall provide
reasonable assistance to Janssen, including providing access to relevant
documents and other evidence in its possession and control, to the extent it
is able to do so without violation of any Third Party agreement, making its
employees available at reasonable business hours, and joining the action to
the extent necessary to allow Janssen to maintain such suit or action.

14.4.11.3 Right to Respond to Other Infringements Related to Gilead Compound
Products Not Including RPV. Gilead, on behalf of and in the name of both
Parties as joint owners, shall have the sole right and option, at its sole
expense, to respond to any Other Infringement with respect to any Joint Patent
to the extent that such Other Infringement relates to any of the Gilead
Compound Products that does not contain RPV by appropriate steps, including
filing an infringement suit or taking other similar action. Gilead shall incur
no liability to Janssen as a consequence of such litigation or any unfavorable
decision resulting therefrom, including any decision holding such Joint Patent
invalid or unenforceable. Janssen, at Gilead's expense, shall provide
reasonable assistance to Gilead, including providing access to relevant
documents and other evidence in its possession and control, to the extent it
is able to do so without violation of any Third Party agreement, making its
employees available at reasonable business hours, and joining the action to
the extent necessary to allow Gilead to maintain such suit or action.

14.4.11.4 Right to Respond to Other Infringements. To the extent that the
right to respond to an Other Infringement of a Joint Patent is not covered by
Sections 14.4.5.1, 14.4.5.2 or 14.4.5.3, the Parties shall mutually agree on
the rights, procedures and obligations of the Parties with respect to such
Other Infringement.

14.4.12 Paragraph (iv) Certifications; Notices of Allegation. Each Party shall
notify the other Party in writing within five (5) Business Days of receiving
any Paragraph (iv) Certification or Notice of Allegation with respect to a
Combination Product or any of its respective Single Agent Product(s) or Double
Agent Products. In the event that a Party provides a notice pursuant to this
Section 14.4.6 of a Paragraph (iv) Certification or a Notice of Allegation
resulting from an attempt to market an Infringing Combination Product or, in
the case of the Joint Patents, a generic version of an Other Infringing
Product, then the rights and obligations in Sections 14.4.1, 14.4.3 and
14.4.5, if applicable, shall apply with respect to any responses to such
Paragraph (iv) Certification or Notice of Allegation to the extent that it
relates to any Gilead Patent, Janssen Patent or Joint Patent as if such
Paragraph (iv) Certification or Notice of

Allegation were an enforcement action under this Section 14.4 with respect to
such Patents. For clarity, neither Party shall have any right to initiate
infringement lawsuits or other similar actions to protect the other Party's
Patents or Joint Patents with respect to the other Party's Single Agent
Products or Double Agent Products.

14.4.13 Recoveries. As between the Parties, any amounts recovered by either
Party pursuant to this Section 14.4 (other than pursuant to Section 14.4.5.2
or 14.4.5.3), whether by settlement or judgment, shall first be used to
reimburse the applicable Party(ies) for their costs and expenses in making
such recovery (which amounts shall be allocated first to reimburse the costs
and expenses of the Party that prosecuted the infringement suit and second to
reimburse the costs and expenses of the other Party). Any remaining recovery
shall be allocated between the Parties based on the proportion of the Net
Sales of the applicable Territory Combination Product to which each Party is
entitled hereunder (at the time that the applicable infringement occurred)
with regard to the applicable country; provided, however, that any portion of
such remaining recovery that constitutes punitive or enhanced damages
recovered by judgment (assuming that recoveries constituting punitive or
enhanced damages are first applied to the foregoing costs and expenses) shall
be retained by the Party that prosecuted the infringement suit. As between the

14.4.5.2 or 14.4.5.3 shall be retained by such Party.

14.5 Defense of Patents.

14.5.1 In the event that a Third Party asserts as a counterclaim to an
Infringement action or Other Infringement action brought pursuant to Section
14.4 that any Gilead Patent, Janssen Patent or Joint Patent is invalid or
unenforceable, the Party controlling such infringement action shall have the
right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost and expense, to defend against
such assertion (and costs and recoveries shall be apportioned as described in
Section 14.4).

14.5.2 In the event that a Third Party asserts, in a declaratory judgment
action or similar action or claim filed by such Third Party (other than in an
Infringement action brought pursuant to Section 14.4), that any Gilead Patent,
Janssen Patent or Joint Patent relating to a Combination Product or Other
Combination Product is invalid or unenforceable: (i) Gilead shall have (x) the
sole right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost and expense, to defend
such action or claim made against any Gilead Patent and (y) the first right,
but not the obligation, at its sole cost and expense, to defend such action or
claim made against any Joint Patent other than any Janssen-Controlled
Combination Product Joint Patent, and (ii) Janssen shall have (x) the sole
right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost and expense, to defend such
action or claim made against any Janssen Patent and (y) the first right, but
not the obligation, at its sole cost and expense, to defend such action or
claim made against any Janssen-Controlled Combination Product Joint Patent,
and in each case ((x) and (y)) Janssen shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to defend such Patents. In the event Janssen fails to take
commercially appropriate steps to take action with respect to any declaratory
judgment action or similar action or claim alleging that any Janssen-
Controlled Combination Product Joint Patent Covering the Manufacture
(including formulation), sale or approved use of a Combination Product or an
Other Combination

Product is invalid or unenforceable, to the extent relating to a Combination
Product, within [*] following notice of such declaratory judgment action or
similar action or claim, or notifies Gilead that it will not take action with
respect to such declaratory judgment action or similar action or claim, then

Joint Patent other than any Janssen-Controlled Combination Product Joint
Patent is invalid or unenforceable, where such claim or action relates to a
Combination Product, within [*] following notice of such declaratory judgment
action or similar action or claim, or notifies Janssen that it will not take

Affiliates, Gilead (or its designee) shall own all right, title and interest
in and to the Combination Product Trademarks. Gilead (or its designee) shall

14.6.8.2 Infringement. If Janssen has a reasonable basis to believe that a
Third Party is engaging in commercially significant infringement of any
Combination Product Trademark in any country in the Territory, Janssen shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Gilead in writing and provide it
with any evidence of such infringement that is reasonably available. As
between the Parties, Gilead shall have the sole right and option, at its sole
expense, to respond to any infringement or potential infringement with respect
to any Combination Product Trademark by appropriate steps, including filing an
infringement suit or taking other similar action, and with respect to any
infringement or potential infringement with respect to any Combination Product
Trademark in the Janssen Countries, shall notify Janssen of, and consult with
Janssen from time to time regarding, any such suit or other action. Janssen
shall provide commercially reasonable assistance to Gilead or its designee, at
Gilead's expense for any out-of-pocket expenses, with respect to any
enforcement activities with respect to the Combination Product Trademarks
pursuant to this Section 14.6.3.2, including providing access to relevant
documents and other evidence, making its employees available at reasonable
business hours, and joining the action to the extent necessary to allow Gilead
or its designee to maintain the action. Any amounts recovered pursuant to this
Section 14.6.3.2, whether by settlement or judgment, shall first be used to
reimburse the applicable Party(ies) for their costs and expenses in making
such recovery. Any remaining recovery shall be allocated between the Parties
based on the proportion of the Net Sales of the applicable Combination Product
to which each Party is entitled hereunder (at the time at which the
infringement occurred) with regard to the applicable country; provided,
however, that any portion of such remaining recovery that constitutes punitive
or enhanced damages recovered by judgment (assuming that recoveries
constituting punitive or enhanced damages are first applied to the foregoing
costs and expenses) shall be retained by Gilead.

15.3 Confidential Information.

15.3.14 Defined. "Confidential Information" of a Party shall mean the terms of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and all information provided by or
on behalf of such Party (or its Affiliates) to the other Party (or its
Affiliates) either in connection with the discussions and negotiations
pertaining to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the MTA or the CDA or
in the course of performing this Agreement or any such other agreement,
including data; knowledge; practices; processes; ideas; research plans;
engineering designs and drawings; research data; manufacturing processes and
techniques; scientific, manufacturing, marketing and business plans; and
financial and personnel matters relating to the Disclosing Party or its
Affiliates, or its or their respective present or future products, sales,
suppliers, customers, employees, investors or business, including any of the
foregoing included in any Annexes or Exhibits to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement. Regardless of which Party is the disclosing Party, the
Janssen-Owned Collaboration Inventions shall constitute Confidential
Information of Janssen, and not Gilead (and Janssen shall be considered the
Disclosing Party), the Gilead-Owned Collaboration Inventions shall constitute
Confidential Information of Gilead, and not Janssen (and Gilead shall be
considered the Disclosing Party), and the Joint Collaboration Inventions shall
constitute the Confidential Information of both Parties (and each Party shall
be considered the Disclosing Party).

15.3.15 Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any information of the
Disclosing Party shall not be deemed Confidential Information with respect to
the Receiving Party if it:

15.3.15.1 was already known to the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates,
other than to the extent and for so long as the Receiving Party (or its
Affiliate) is under an obligation of confidentiality or non-use with respect
to such information, at the time of disclosure to such Receiving Party or its
Affiliate;

15.3.15.2 was generally available or known, or was otherwise part of the
public domain, at the time of disclosure to such Receiving Party or its
Affiliate;



109

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





15.3.15.3 became generally available or known, or otherwise became part of the
public domain, through no fault of the Receiving Party or any of its
Affiliates in violation of this Article 15 or the CDA, after its disclosure to
such Receiving Party or its Affiliate;

15.3.15.4 was received by such Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates from a
Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party, had no obligation
to the Disclosing Party (or its Affiliate) not to make such disclosure; or

15.3.15.5 was independently discovered or developed by such Receiving Party or
any of its Affiliates, as evidenced by their written records, without the use
of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

Specific aspects or details of Confidential Information shall not be deemed to
be within the public domain or in the possession of a Party or its Affiliate
merely because the Confidential Information is embraced by more general
information in the public domain or in the possession of such Party or its
Affiliate. Further, any combination of Confidential Information shall not be
considered in the public domain or in the possession of a Party or its
Affiliate merely because individual elements of such Confidential Information
are in the public domain or in the possession of such Party or its Affiliate
unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in the
possession of such Party or its Affiliate.

15.4 Notification. Each Party shall notify the other Party immediately, and
cooperate with the other Party as the other Party may reasonably request, upon
the first Party's discovery of any loss or compromise of the other Party's
Confidential Information.

15.5 Data Privacy. Without limitation of its other obligations under this
Article 15, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to,
comply with Applicable Law, including the applicable national laws
implementing the European Union Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data of 24 October 1995, with respect to the collection, use,
transfer, storage, deletion, processing (both by computer and manually),
combination or other use of subject or other personal data as contemplated by
applicable data protection or privacy laws of all data relating to any Person
about whom or which data may be collected, retained or exchanged pursuant to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, ensure
that it takes any technical and organizational measures required by Applicable
Law to protect any such data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
damage, alteration, disclosure, access or data processing and against all
other unauthorized disclosure, access or forms of data processing.

15.6 Remedies. Each Party agrees that the unauthorized use or disclosure of
any material Confidential Information by the Receiving Party in violation of
this Agreement may cause severe and irreparable damage to the Disclosing
Party, for which money damages may represent an insufficient remedy. In the
event of any violation of this Article 15, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Disclosing Party shall be authorized and
entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief,
whether preliminary or

upon or after the Restatement Effective Date, that certain press release of
such Party attached hereto as Annex S.

16.2 Other Public Disclosures. As between the Parties, subject to Section 3.6
and this Section 16.2, Gilead shall have the primary responsibility for public
communications regarding the Exploitation of the Territory Combination
Products in the Territory. If either Party or its Affiliates desires to make a
public announcement (such as a press release) that relates to the Exploitation
of a Territory Combination Product, other than (i) with respect to Results,
which are governed by Section 3.6, or (ii) subject to the following sentence,
general business updates (even if they include information relating to a
Territory Combination Product, so long as they are of the type of updates that
are also generally made for such Party's other similar pharmaceutical products
generally), the announcing Party (or Affiliate) shall give reasonable advance
notice of the proposed text of such announcement (translated into English, if
not in English) to the other Party for its prior review. Other than with
respect to Results, which are governed by Section 3.6, (a) in the case of
Janssen as the announcing Party, any proposed public announcement that refers
to the safety, efficacy or other characteristics of a Territory Combination
Product or any Gilead Compound Product, shall be subject to prior written
approval by Gilead, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed and (b) in the case of Gilead as the announcing Party, any proposed
public announcement that refers to the safety, efficacy or other
characteristics of a Territory Combination Product or any RPV Product, shall
be subject to prior written approval by Janssen, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing shall preclude either Party from making any public announcement
regarding its generics program that is not specific to the other Party (or its
Affiliates) and no such announcement shall be subject to prior review by the
other Party hereunder. Further, if any proposed public announcement by either
Party that relates to the Exploitation of a Territory Combination Product uses
any name or any Trademark of the other Party or its Affiliates (other than a
Gilead Licensed Trademark or a Janssen Licensed Trademark used in connection
with Territory Combination Product), such public announcement shall be subject
to prior approval of such other Party, except to the extent such announcement
is required by Applicable Law. If the non-announcing Party with respect to any
public announcement provided by the announcing Party for review under this
Section 16.2 desires to provide comments or, if applicable, indicate whether
the applicable public announcement is approved, it shall do so as soon as
reasonably practicable but in any event within three (3) Business Days after
receiving the proposed announcement for review. Subject to Section 16.3,
neither Party shall be required to have the other Party review or, if
applicable, approve the public disclosure of any information that has already
been publicly disclosed by either Party in accordance with Section 3.6,
Section 15.2 or this Section 16.2. In the event of a legally required press
release or other public announcement or disclosure, the Party (or its
Affiliate) desiring to make such announcement shall provide the other Party
with a copy of the proposed text with as much notice

circumstances, be no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed

promptly as practicable (but not less than one (1) Business Day prior to the

consideration any and all reasonable comments that the other Party may provide
in a timely manner; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if
a Party determines that it or any of its Affiliates must make a legally
required disclosure under Applicable Law, then it or its Affiliate, as
applicable, shall have the right to make such disclosure at such time as is
necessary to comply with Applicable Law, and shall provide the other Party as
much notice and opportunity for review and comment as is practicable in the
circumstances. Without limitation of any of the foregoing, each Party shall
comply, and ensure that its Affiliates and Sublicensees comply with, any press
release or other non-disclosure provisions as required by any In-License
Agreement, as specified in the In-License Requirements.

16.3 Use of Names. Except as otherwise permitted expressly herein or in any
Ancillary Agreement or other written agreement between the Parties (or their
respective Affiliates), neither Party shall mention or otherwise use any
Trademark, including any name, insignia, symbol, trade name or logotype of the
other Party or its Affiliates or of any party to an In-License Agreement of
the other Party or its Affiliates (or any abbreviation or adaptation thereof)
in any publication, press release, promotional material or other form of
publicity without the prior written approval of such other Party in each
instance. The restrictions imposed by this Section 16.3 shall not prohibit a
Party from making any (a) use of the brand name or brand mark of the other
Party's Single Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Product or (b) disclosure
identifying the other Party (or such other Party's predecessor) or such other
Party's Single Agent Product(s) or Double Agent Product(s), in each case ((a)
and (b)), that is required by Applicable Law, nor shall it prohibit Janssen
from using the brand name or brand mark for a Territory Combination Product or
Combination Product Trademarks in informational materials, provided that any
substantive inquiries relating to the Territory Combination Products that
arise from such use are referred to the appropriate Party in accordance with
Section 5.2 or Section 6.3.2, as applicable, and, further provided that such
use shall not be accompanied by any claims regarding the safety or efficacy of
such Territory Combination Product, or otherwise describe the characteristics
of such Territory Combination Product, other than the identification of the

such section. Such Party agrees to inform the other Party in writing
immediately if it or any Person who is performing activities on its behalf
under this Agreement is debarred or is the subject of a conviction described

agrees that it shall not, from and after the Restatement Effective Date and
throughout the Term, grant to any Third Party any right or license in respect
of the Patents licensed hereunder, including by amending any existing
agreement, that would conflict with any grant to the other Party hereunder.

contrary in this Agreement, such Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
Sublicensees and Third Party Distributors to, comply with all Applicable Law
of the country or other jurisdiction, or any court or agency thereof,
applicable to the performance of its activities hereunder or any obligation or
transaction hereunder, including those pertaining to the production and
handling of drug products (which shall also be subject in the case of the

any of the Gilead Patents that are composition of matter Patents are invalid

representations in this Section 17.3.2 are made as of the Original Effective
Date.

17.3.11 There are no judgments or settlements against, or amounts with respect

incurred by the Indemnified Party or any of its Indemnified Persons to the

18.1.10 Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 18, in no event
shall either Party's obligations of indemnity or reimbursement under this

Applicable Law by, the other Party or any of its Indemnified Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder or in any Ancillary
Agreement, neither Gilead nor Janssen shall be liable for, nor be obligated to

Persons with respect to any act or omission of any Generic Licensee and any

18.2 Indemnification for Certain Product Liability-Related Matters.

18.2.15 By Gilead. Gilead shall indemnify Janssen and its Indemnified Persons
from and against (i) all Proceedings arising anywhere in the world in which
Janssen or any of its Indemnified Persons is involved or threatened to be
involved to the extent such Proceedings arise from personal injury or death
caused by a Territory Combination Product due to defects or the inherent
characteristics thereof, where the preponderance of the evidence indicates
that such defects or characteristics are the direct result of the
incorporation (where, for purposes of this Section 18.2 and Section 18.3,
"incorporation" shall be construed to mean the presence of an API in a
Territory Combination Product, not the process whereby such API is included in
a Territory Combination Product or the formulation of a Territory Combination
Product and "incorporated" shall be construed in a corresponding manner) in
such Territory Combination Product of TDF, TAF or FTC, or both TDF and FTC or
TAF and FTC, in each case without reference to the incorporation in such
Territory Combination Product of the Supplied RPV (other than any Selected
Product Liability Proceedings, which, for purposes of clarity, are provided
for in Section 18.3), irrespective of whether such defects or characteristics
(or any associated defects or characteristics of TDF, TAF or FTC) are known as
of the Original Effective Date [*] (such defects or characteristics, "Gilead
Component Characteristics"), and (ii) all Losses (other than Selected Product
Liability Losses) incurred by Janssen or any of its Indemnified Persons
arising from any Proceeding covered by the foregoing clause (i) to the extent
arising from Gilead Component Characteristics.

18.2.16 By Janssen. Janssen shall indemnify Gilead and its Indemnified Persons
from and against (i) all Proceedings arising anywhere in the world in which
Gilead or any of its Indemnified Persons is involved or threatened to be
involved to the extent such Proceedings arise from personal injury or death
caused by a Territory Combination Product due to (A) defects or the inherent
characteristics thereof, where the preponderance of the evidence indicates
that such defects or characteristics are the direct result of the
incorporation in such Territory Combination Product of the Supplied RPV
without reference to the incorporation in such Territory Combination Product
of TDF, TAF or FTC or any combination of the foregoing (other than any
Selected Product Liability Proceedings, which, for purposes of clarity, are
provided for in

Section 18.3), irrespective of whether such defects or characteristics (or any
associated defects or characteristics of the Supplied RPV) are known as of the
Original Effective Date [*] (such defects or characteristics, "RPV
Characteristics") or (B) the Label Characteristics (as defined below), and
(ii) all Losses (other than Selected Product Liability Losses) incurred by
Gilead or any of its Indemnified Persons arising from any Proceeding covered
by the foregoing clause (i) to the extent arising from RPV Characteristics or
the Label Characteristics. "Label Characteristics" shall mean the failure of
the Product Label for Janssen's Single Agent Product to represent, in all
material respects and to Janssen's knowledge as of the date such Product Label
is obtained, a complete and accurate reflection of the safety and efficacy
profile of Janssen's Single Agent Product as of such date, which failure leads
to the failure of the Product Label for a Territory Combination Product to
represent, in all material respects and to Janssen's knowledge as of such
date, a complete and accurate reflection of the safety and efficacy profile of
the RPV portion of such Territory Combination Product as of such date.

18.3 Selected Product Liability Losses. Any Selected Product Liability Losses
shall be borne by Gilead and Janssen in accordance with the applicable Average
Respective Percentages with respect to the Territory. "Selected Product
Liability Losses" shall mean any Losses arising out of any Selected Product
Liability Proceeding. "Selected Product Liability Proceeding" shall mean any
Proceeding arising anywhere in the world in which any Party or any of its
Indemnified Persons is involved or threatened to be involved to the extent
such Proceedings arise from personal injury or death caused by a Territory
Combination Product due to defects or the inherent characteristics of such
Territory Combination Product, (a) where the preponderance of the evidence
indicates that such defects or characteristics are the direct result of both
(i) the Supplied RPV and (ii) TDF, TAF or FTC or any combination of the
foregoing being incorporated into such Territory Combination Product, (b)
where it ultimately cannot be or is not determined whether such defects or
characteristics are the direct result of the Supplied RPV, on the one hand, or
the TDF, TAF or FTC or any combination of the foregoing, on the other hand,
being incorporated into such Territory Combination Product, or (c) where such
defects or characteristics are the direct result of an aspect of such
Territory Combination Product other than any of its APIs, except, in each case
((a), (b) and (c)), to the extent such Proceeding arises from personal injury
or death caused by a Territory Combination Product due to the Label
Characteristics, which Proceeding is covered in Section 18.2.2.

18.4.1 By Gilead. Gilead shall indemnify Janssen and its Indemnified Persons
from and against (i) any Proceeding arising anywhere in the world in which
Janssen or any of its Indemnified Persons is involved or threatened to be
involved to the extent that (x) (A) such Proceeding arises out of an
allegation that any Exploitation of any Territory Combination Product in a
country that, as of the time of such Exploitation, is a Gilead Country
infringes or misappropriates, or will infringe or misappropriate, any patent
or other intellectual property, including trade secrets, of a Third Party, and
(B) such infringement or misappropriation does not directly result from a RPV
Infringement, or (y) (A) such Proceeding arises out of an allegation that any
Exploitation of any Territory Combination Product in a country that, as of the
time of such Exploitation, is a Janssen Country infringes or misappropriates,
or will infringe or

misappropriate, any patent or other intellectual property, including trade

directly results from a Gilead Compound Infringement, and (ii) all Losses
arising from such a Proceeding incurred by Janssen or any of its Indemnified

Indemnified Persons from and against (i) any Proceeding arising anywhere in
the world where Janssen is licensed by Gilead to use the Combination Product
Trademark in which Janssen or any of its Indemnified Persons is involved or
threatened to be involved to the extent that such Proceeding arises out of an
allegation that the use of the Combination Product Trademark infringes or
dilutes the Trademark rights of any Third Party, and (ii) all Losses arising
from such a Proceeding incurred by Janssen or any of its Indemnified Persons,
as the case may be, to the extent arising as a direct result of such use in
accordance with this Agreement.

18.4.3 By Janssen. Janssen shall indemnify Gilead and its Indemnified Persons
from and against (i) any Proceeding in which Gilead or any of its Indemnified
Persons is involved or threatened to be involved to the extent that (x) (A)

Territory Combination Product in a country that, as of the time of such
Exploitation, is a Gilead Country infringes or misappropriates, or will
infringe or misappropriate, any patent or other intellectual property,
including trade secrets, of a Third Party and (B) such infringement or
misappropriation directly results from an RPV Infringement, or (y) (A) such
Proceeding arises out of an allegation that any Exploitation of any Territory
Combination Product in a country that, as of the time of such Exploitation, is
a Janssen Country infringes or misappropriates, or will infringe or
misappropriate, any patent or other intellectual property, including trade
secrets, of a Third Party, and (B) such infringement or misappropriation does

Persons, as the case may be, to the extent arising (x) in the case of any
Proceeding described in clause (i)(x) above, as a direct result of an RPV
Infringement, or (y) in the case of any Proceeding described in clause (i)(y)

18.5 Enforcement and Defense of Patents. If a Party exercises step-in rights
to remove Infringement under Section 14.4.2 or 14.4.3 (as applicable) or to
defend an action or claim under Section 14.5.1 or Section 14.5.2, as
applicable (each of the foregoing, for the purposes of this Section 18.5,
takes an "Action"): (a) the Party taking the Action shall indemnify the other
Party and the other Party's Indemnified Persons (as applicable) from and
against any Proceedings and Losses arising from a claim by a governmental
entity of intentional misconduct by either Party as a result of such Action,
provided that the Party taking Action had knowledge of alleged intentional

1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





18.6 Other Shared Combination Product-Related Losses. With respect to any
Losses arising out of any Proceeding brought or made against any Party or any
of its Indemnified Persons to the extent arising out of the Exploitation of a
Territory Combination Product (including (a) any Manufacture of any Territory
Combination Product, and (b) any activities performed by or on behalf of any
Party, in its capacity as the MA Holder), except to the extent that either
Party has an obligation of indemnification with respect to such Losses
pursuant to any of Sections 18.1 through 18.5, Gilead and Janssen shall each
bear such portion of such Losses in accordance with its applicable Average
Respective Percentage with respect to the Territory.

18.7 Indemnification Procedure. The indemnity and reimbursement obligations of
a Party under this Article 18 shall be governed by the following:

18.7.1 Notice. In the case of any Proceeding for which an Indemnifying Party
may be liable to an Indemnified Person under this Article 18, the Indemnified
Party shall as soon as practicable notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Proceeding (a "Notice of Claim"). Failure or delay in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
it may have to the Indemnified Party, except and only to the extent that such
failure or delay causes actual harm to the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such Proceeding. The Notice of Claim shall specify in reasonable detail the
Proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party or any of its
Indemnified Persons intends to base a request for indemnification or
reimbursement under this Article 18. Failure to provide such reasonable detail
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to the
Indemnified Party, except and only to the extent that such failure causes
actual harm to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Proceeding. The
Indemnified Party shall enclose with the Notice of Claim a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Proceeding, if any. The Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days from the date on which the Indemnifying Party received
the Notice of Claim to notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party desires to assume the defense of such Proceeding and any litigation
resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice.

18.7.2 Control of the Defense. If the Indemnifying Party has given the
Indemnified Party notice pursuant to Section 18.7.1 that it desires to assume
control of a Proceeding and the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing
an obligation to indemnify or reimburse fully the Indemnified Party or its
applicable Indemnified Person(s) for all Losses arising from the Proceeding
(to the extent such Losses and Proceedings are covered by such Indemnifying
Party's indemnity obligations under Sections 18.1, 18.2, 18.4 or 18.5), then,
subject to Section 18.7.4, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend, settle and otherwise dispose of such Proceeding (such Party,
"Defending Party"). If the Indemnifying Party provides notice that it desires
to assume control of the Proceeding, but the Indemnifying Party does not have
the right to be the Defending Party pursuant to the preceding sentence, or if
Losses are to be allocated under Section 18.3 or 18.6, then the Parties shall
confer and negotiate in good faith to determine whether to enter into a joint
defense agreement pursuant to which the Parties shall allocate the respective
rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to the control of the
Proceeding, including whether to designate one of the Parties as the Defending
Party. In the event that there are two or more Indemnified Parties or
Indemnified Persons that are subject to the same Proceeding, this Section 18.7
shall be construed to apply separately to



124



[ * ] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY
BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





such Proceeding as it applies to each such Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Person, provided that the applicable Parties agree to take account of such
fact in connection with their negotiations pursuant to this Section 18.7.2
with respect to the defense, control and settlement of such Proceeding as it
applies to each such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person. The out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) reasonably
incurred by the Defending Party in connection with its control of a Proceeding
shall constitute Losses with respect to such Proceeding.

18.7.3 Interim Control. Unless and until the Defending Party is determined,
the Indemnified Party subject to such Proceeding shall have the right to
defend and control such Proceeding, but shall not have the right to consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Proceeding for which it would be seeking indemnification or reimbursement
hereunder (including under Section 18.3 or 18.6) without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

18.7.4 Control by the Defending Party. If either Party is the Defending Party,
(i) the other Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense (from and after the Defending Party's assumption of control of the
Proceeding) and participate in the defense of the Proceeding but the Defending
Party shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, (ii)
the other Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Proceeding for which it would be seeking
indemnification or reimbursement hereunder without the prior written consent
of the Defending Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (iii) the Defending Party will not, without the
prior written consent of the other Party, consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to the Proceeding to the extent such
judgment or settlement (A) provides for equitable relief (or any other relief
other than solely for money damages) or liability or obligation that cannot be
assumed and performed by the Defending Party in full (without any recourse to
the other Party and its Indemnified Persons), or for any monetary relief that
will not be fully discharged by the Defending Party (without any recourse to
the other Party and its Indemnified Persons) concurrently with the
effectiveness of such judgment or settlement, provided that the other Party's
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed to the
extent that the sole relief is monetary, (B) does not effect a full and
unconditional release of the other Party and its Indemnified Persons with
respect to all claims in such Proceeding (or the portion thereof to which the
judgment or settlement relates), or (C) contains an admission of wrongdoing on
the part of the other Party or its Indemnified Persons. The Parties shall act
in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with such Proceeding; provided, however, that (x) an Indemnified Party
shall not be obligated pursuant to this sentence to enter into or consent to
the entry of any judgment or settlement in relation to any Proceeding and (y)
in any event, an Indemnifying Party shall not be relieved of its obligations
under this sentence as a result of any breach of this sentence (determined
after giving effect to clause (x)) except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced by such breach. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, an Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to assume the defense of any Proceeding that seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief (or any other relief other than solely money damages) against

the Indemnified Person. The Parties shall also cooperate in any such defense
and give each other reasonable access to all non-privileged information
relevant thereto to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

18.7.5 Election Not to Control. If there is no Defending Party with respect to
a given Proceeding, then the Indemnified Party will be entitled to assume
control of the Proceeding, at its cost and expense (or to the extent the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or reimbursement with respect
thereto pursuant to this Article 18, at the expense of the other Party to such
extent) upon delivery of notice to such effect to the other Party; provided
that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the
Proceeding at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnified Party shall
control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof.

18.7.6 Unauthorized Settlements. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has
assumed control of the Proceeding, such Indemnifying Party shall not be
obligated to indemnify or reimburse the Indemnified Party hereunder for any
settlement entered into, or any judgment that was consented to, by the
Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

18.7.7 Allocations. The allocation between the Parties (whether by
indemnification, reimbursement or otherwise) of any liability for any Losses,
if not otherwise determined in a court of law, shall be considered by the
Parties and, if the Parties do not reach agreement in writing on such
allocation, either Party shall have the right to refer the Dispute to dispute
resolution pursuant to Section 20.6. The Parties, the Executives or the
arbitrator, as the case may be, shall make such allocation based on the
indemnification and reimbursement principles set forth in this Article 18.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall not be entitled to refer any
Dispute with respect to Losses arising under a Proceeding pursuant to this
Section 18.7.7 to arbitration to the extent that the liability of either Party
for such Losses is being contested in such Proceeding (or any other Proceeding
that would be binding with respect to such first Proceeding).

18.7.8 Third Party Rights. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to
coordinate with respect to the rights set forth in this Section 18.7,
including any rights with respect to the control of any applicable Proceeding,
to take into account the rights of any Third Party (e.g., a subcontractor of a
Party) that has an obligation to indemnify any Party (or its Indemnified
Persons) with respect to any Losses covered by this Article 18.

18.8 LIMITATION ON DAMAGES. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO LIABILITY ARISING FROM
BREACHES OF ARTICLE 15 BY A PARTY, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER
PARTY FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLIED OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR LOST PROFITS), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 18.8 IS
INTENDED TO OR SHALL OPERATE TO LIMIT A PARTY'S OBLIGATIONS OF INDEMNITY OR
REIMBURSEMENT OF LOSSES UNDER THIS ARTICLE 18.

TERM AND TERMINATION 

19.1 Term. The term of this Agreement ("Term") shall commence as of the
Restatement Effective Date and shall expire, on a Territory Combination
Product-by-Territory Combination Product and country-by-country basis, at the
end of the Monthly Payment Term for the applicable Territory Combination
Product in the applicable country unless terminated earlier pursuant to this
Article 19.

19.2 Challenge by Governmental Authority. In the event that any governmental
authority in a country obtains a preliminary injunction or permanent
injunction enjoining the transactions between the Parties in connection with
entering into this Agreement with respect to a Territory Combination Product,
the Parties shall meet and discuss whether to terminate this Agreement with
respect to such Territory Combination Product in such country.

19.3 Territory Combination Product Withdrawal. The Selling Party may terminate
this Agreement with respect to a Territory Combination Product and a country
if such Territory Combination Product is withdrawn from the market in such
country pursuant to Section 13.2. In the event of any termination with respect
to a Territory Combination Product and a country or countries pursuant to this
Section 19.3, such termination with respect to such Territory Combination
Product and country(ies) shall be effective immediately upon written notice to
the non-Selling Party. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Selling
Party terminates this Agreement with respect to a Territory Combination
Product and a country under this Section 19.3, (a) Gilead may not submit or
resubmit any Drug Approval Application or maintain any Regulatory Approval
with respect to such Territory Combination Product in such country containing
any Confidential Information of Janssen, Janssen Regulatory Documentation or a
Right of Reference provided by Janssen under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement following such termination; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not preclude the exercise of rights granted to Gilead for any purpose
expressly permitted hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement hereto with
respect to products other than such Territory Combination Product, provided
that such right survives termination (such rights, the "Gilead Specified
Rights"), and (b) Janssen may not submit or resubmit any Drug Approval
Application or maintain any Regulatory Approval with respect to such Territory
Combination Product in such country containing any Confidential Information of
Gilead, Gilead Regulatory Documentation or a Right of Reference provided by
Gilead under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement following such
termination; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude the
exercise of rights granted to Janssen for any purpose expressly permitted
hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement hereto with respect to products
other than such Territory Combination Product, provided that such right
survives termination (such rights, the "Janssen Specified Rights").

19.4 Material Breach.

19.4.1 Notice and Cure Period. If a Party (the "Breaching Party") is in
Material Breach, the other Party (the "Non-Breaching Party") shall have the
right to give the Breaching Party notice specifying the nature of such
Material Breach. Except as set forth in



127



[ * ] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY
BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





Section 6.2.2.5 with respect to Initial Specific Target Breaches, the
Breaching Party shall have a period of ninety (90) days after receipt of such
notice to cure such Material Breach (including Commercial Target Breaches
other than Initial Specific Target Breaches) (the "Cure Period") in a manner
reasonably acceptable to the Non-Breaching Party. For the avoidance of doubt,
this provision is not intended to restrict in any way either Party's right to
notify the other Party of any other breach or to demand the cure of any other
breach.

19.4.2 Termination Right. The Non-Breaching Party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to the Territory Combination Product to
which the Material Breach relates, upon written notice to the Breaching Party,
in the event that the Breaching Party has not, in the case of an Initial
Specific Target Breach, cured such Material Breach within the applicable time
period set forth in Section 6.2.2.5, or in the case of any other Material
Breach, cured such Material Breach within the Cure Period. If a Party contests
such termination pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures under Section
20.6, such termination shall not be effective until a conclusion of the
dispute resolution procedures in Section 20.6, as applicable, resulting in a
determination that there has been an uncured Material Breach (or, if earlier,
abandonment of the Dispute by such Party). If the Breaching Party asserts that
the Material Breach has been cured, this Agreement with respect to the
applicable Territory Combination Product shall not be terminated if the
alleged cure has effectively remedied the harm to the Non-Breaching Party
caused by the Material Breach.

19.5 Voluntary Termination.

19.5.1 Voluntary Termination of Supply Obligations by Janssen. Janssen may
terminate (a) its supply obligations under this Agreement and (b) the RPV
Supply Agreement, in each case with respect to a Territory Combination
Product, which termination shall be effective [*] after the later of (w) the
date Janssen provides Gilead written notice of such termination and (x) the
expiration or termination of this Agreement with respect to such Territory
Combination Product in [*]. For clarity, in each case, such notice may be
provided prior to the applicable expiration or termination of this Agreement.
Following the effective date of termination of Janssen's supply obligations
with respect to a Territory Combination Product pursuant to this Section
19.5.1, Gilead shall no longer be obligated to purchase RPV from Janssen with
respect to such Territory Combination Product. For the avoidance of doubt,
Janssen's termination rights under this Section 19.5.1 only relate to its
supply obligations (i.e., those under Article 8 and the RPV Supply Agreement).
All other provisions of this Agreement, including the license grants to Gilead
hereunder, shall remain in full force and effect unless otherwise agreed by
the Parties in writing (or until they otherwise expire or terminate pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement), and a termination under this Section 19.5.1
shall not be considered a "termination of this Agreement."

19.5.2 Voluntary Termination by Gilead. Gilead may terminate this Agreement
(a) with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF Product in a Gilead Country (i) at
any time before the First Commercial Sale of the Territory R/F/TAF Product in
such Gilead Country, upon [*] advance written notice to Janssen, or (ii) at
any time after the First Commercial Sale of the Territory R/F/TAF Product in
such Gilead Country, upon [*] advance written notice to Janssen,

and (b) with respect to Territory Complera in a Major Market Country, subject
to Section 4.8, at any time after the termination of Gilead's obligation under
Section 4.1.1 to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain and maintain a
first Marketing Approval for Territory Complera in such Major Market Country.
In the event Gilead provides a notice of termination of this Agreement under
clause (a)(ii) of this Section 19.5.2 with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF
Product in a Gilead Country at any time after the First Commercial Sale of the
Territory R/F/TAF Product in such country but before the [*] anniversary of
the First Commercial Sale of the Territory R/F/TAF Product in such country,
Janssen shall have the right to elect to convert such country from a Gilead
Country to a Janssen Take-Over Country with respect to all Territory
Combination Products by providing notice to Gilead within [*] of Gilead
providing Janssen the notice described in clause (a)(ii) of this Section
19.5.2. Thereafter, such country shall be deemed a Janssen Take-Over Country
and, if such country is a Specified Percentage Country prior to such election
by Janssen, such country shall thereafter no longer be deemed a Specified
Percentage Country. In the case of such an election by Janssen, Gilead, upon
receiving any necessary or appropriate approval from the applicable Regulatory
Authority(ies), shall cease selling (and cause its Affiliates, Sublicensees,
Third Party Distributors and subdistributors, as applicable, to cease selling)
the Territory Combination Product in the applicable Janssen Take-Over Country,
but shall not conduct any withdrawal or recall with respect to the Territory
Combination Product in such Janssen Take-Over Country. If Gilead (or its
Affiliate or Third Party Distributor) holds any Drug Approval Application or
Marketing Approval with respect to any Territory Combination Product with
respect to such Janssen Take-Over Country, Gilead shall, [*], as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the effective date of such termination, transfer
(or cause to be transferred) to Janssen (or its designated Affiliate,
Sublicensee or Third Party Distributor) such Drug Approval Application(s) or
Marketing Approval(s) and the Parties shall coordinate in good faith to effect
such transfer (and, for clarity, until such time as such transfer has been
completed, as between the Parties, Gilead shall remain responsible for
performing all activities required to be performed by the holder of such Drug
Approval Application(s) or Marketing Approval(s) in accordance with Applicable
Law), provided that (a) if such Janssen Take-Over Country is in the European
Union and not all countries in the European Union have been deemed Janssen
Take-Over Countries, Gilead shall continue to hold any Marketing Approval for
the Territory Combination Products granted by the European Commission for such
Janssen Take-Over Country and the Parties shall coordinate in good faith so
that Janssen can operate under such Marketing Approval, and (b) if such
Janssen Take-Over Country is in the European Union and all countries in the
European Union have been deemed Janssen Take-Over Countries, Gilead shall
transfer the Marketing Approvals for the Territory Combination Products by the
European Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable and the Parties
shall coordinate in good faith to effect such transfer. Gilead shall remain
responsible for the performance of its obligations under the Collaboration
Agreement with respect to the Janssen Take-Over Country as a Gilead Country
for the period during which it was a Gilead Country, including with respect to
indemnification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring during such
period. For clarity, Jansen shall [*] with respect to the Exploitation of any
Territory Combination Product with respect to such Janssen Take-Over Country.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Gilead terminates this Agreement with
respect to a Territory Combination Product in a Gilead Country under this
Section 19.5.2, Gilead may not submit or resubmit any Drug Approval
Application, or maintain any Regulatory Approval, with respect to

such Territory Combination Product in such Gilead Country, that contains any
Confidential Information of Janssen, Janssen Regulatory Documentation or a
Right of Reference provided by Janssen under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement following such termination; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not preclude the exercise of the Gilead Specified Rights. Gilead has no
right under this Section 19.5.2 to terminate this Agreement with respect to
any Janssen Country. For clarity, with respect to Janssen Take-Over Countries,
revenue from Triggering Sales in such countries shall be shared between the
Parties pursuant to the terms in the Janssen Distributor Agreement.

19.5.3 By Janssen Upon Gilead Failure to Develop. Janssen may, by written
notice to Gilead, prior to when first Marketing Approval is first obtained
from any of the FDA, [*] or the European Commission for the Territory R/F/TAF
Product, terminate this Agreement with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF
Product in the event that Gilead has ceased to conduct Combination Product
Development Activities with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF Product for a
period of [*] or longer, provided that Gilead shall have a period of [*] after
receipt of such notice to cure such failure to perform, which termination
shall be automatically effective at the end of such cure period if Gilead has
not recommenced Combination Product Development Activities with respect to the
Territory R/F/TAF Product in good faith and notified Janssen of such
recommencement by the end of such period. Gilead shall have a right to contest
a termination under this Section 19.5.3 pursuant to the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in Section 20.6, in which case such termination shall not
be effective until a conclusion of the dispute resolution procedures in
Section 20.6 resulting in a determination that there has been an uncured
failure to conduct Combination Product Development Activities with respect to
the Territory R/F/TAF Product for a period of [*] or longer (or, if earlier,
abandonment of the Dispute by Gilead). For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event Janssen terminates this Agreement with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF
Product under this Section 19.5.3, (a) Gilead may not submit or resubmit any
Drug Approval Application or maintain any Regulatory Approval in any country
with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF Product that contains any Confidential
Information of Janssen, any Janssen Regulatory Documentation or a Right of
Reference provided by Janssen under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
following such termination; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
preclude the exercise of the Gilead Specified Rights, and (b) Janssen may not
submit or resubmit any Drug Approval Application or maintain any Regulatory
Approval in any country with respect to the Territory R/F/TAF Product that
contains any Confidential Information of Gilead, any Gilead Regulatory
Documentation or a Right of Reference provided by Gilead under this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement following such termination; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not preclude the exercise of the Janssen Specified Rights.

19.6 Consequences of Termination.

19.6.9 Termination For Any Reason. Upon termination of this Agreement in its
entirety or with respect to a Territory Combination Product in one or more
country(ies) for any reason, the provisions of this Section 19.6.1 shall
apply, with respect to the applicable country(ies), in the case of a country-
specific termination, or all countries in the Territory, in the case of
termination of this Agreement in its entirety (the "Terminated Countries").

19.6.9.1 The license and other rights granted to a Party in Article 9 with
respect to the applicable Territory Combination Product(s) shall survive only
to the extent necessary to enable such Party (or its Affiliates) to perform
any surviving obligations or exercise any surviving rights of such Party (or
its Affiliates).

following such termination in such Terminated Countries; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not preclude the exercise of the Gilead Specified
Rights, and (b) Janssen may not submit or resubmit any Drug Approval
Application with respect to the applicable Territory Combination Product(s) in

each Party shall make arrangements for, at the election of the other Party,
either the return or disposal of any Confidential Information of the other
Party, whether such Confidential Information is in tangible or intangible form
(except for one (1) copy which may be retained solely for archival purposes);
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any such
Confidential Information (i) to the extent that this Agreement or any other
binding agreement between the Parties (or their respective Affiliates)
expressly provides that the returning Party retains the right to use such
Confidential Information (e.g., with respect to a Territory Combination
Product other than the Territory Combination Product that is subject to such
termination, or in the case of a surviving license) following such termination
in such Terminated Countries or (ii) in the case of a country-specific
termination, to the extent that such Confidential Information is relevant to
any country that is not one of the Terminated Countries.

19.6.9.4 No later than thirty (30) days after the date of such termination,
the Parties shall coordinate in good faith to wind down matters relating to

precluded by this Agreement, the aggrieved Party may also seek damages and
other relief for such Material Breach and (for the avoidance of doubt) for any

19.6.11 Voluntary Termination of Supply Obligations by Janssen.

19.6.11.1 If Janssen voluntarily terminates its supply obligations under this
Agreement and the RPV Supply Agreement with respect to a Territory Combination
Product pursuant to Section 19.5.1, then, at the request of Gilead, the
Parties shall negotiate an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to which
Janssen shall no longer have any obligation to supply RPV with respect to such
Territory Combination Product for the remainder of the Term, but according to
which Gilead may continue to develop and commercialize such Territory
Combination Product in the countries in the Territory for the remainder of the
Term and following expiration of this Agreement, if applicable (other than,
for clarity, in any countries that are Terminated Countries with respect to
such Territory Combination Product) using RPV supplied from Third Parties or
manufactured by Gilead or an Affiliate of Gilead. Such amendment(s) shall (a)
grant Gilead such licenses or sublicenses as may be required in order for
Gilead to obtain RPV with respect to the applicable Territory Combination
Product from Third Parties or for Gilead or an Affiliate of Gilead to
manufacture RPV with respect to the applicable Territory Combination Product
(including any such licenses or sublicenses as may be required in the event of
any transfer of any Information and Inventions under subsection (ii) of
Section 19.6.3.2), (b) provide to Janssen analogous compensation for a given
Unit of such Territory Combination Product (taking account of the fact that
Janssen will not be paid for supplying RPV with respect to such Territory
Combination Product and the fact that Gilead will have to manufacture or
contract with a Third Party to manufacture RPV with respect to such Territory
Combination Product) and (c) include such other commercially reasonable terms
and conditions as may be required to reflect the fact that Janssen is no
longer the supplier of RPV to Gilead with respect to such Territory
Combination Product. Such amendment(s) shall also permit Gilead to continue to
sublicense to, and use, any Third Party Distributor or Affiliate of Gilead
(but excluding any Generic Licensee) as specified in this Agreement.

19.6.11.2 Without limitation of any of the foregoing, upon Gilead\'s request
and [*], Janssen shall (i) provide reasonable assistance to Gilead or its
Affiliate in sourcing RPV with respect to the applicable Territory Combination
Product from an alternate Third Party supplier and/or (ii) transfer to
Gilead\'s selected Third Party supplier or, if Gilead or an Affiliate of
Gilead will manufacture RPV with respect to such Territory Combination
Product, Gilead or such Affiliate, all Information and Inventions Controlled
by Janssen that are necessary or useful to enable the manufacture of RPV with
respect to such Territory Combination Product by providing copies or samples
of relevant documentation, materials and other embodiments of such Information
and Inventions, and by making available Janssen\'s qualified technical
personnel on a reasonable basis to consult with, such Third Party supplier,
Gilead or such Affiliate, as applicable, with respect to such Information and
Inventions and the manufacturing process for RPV.

19.6.11.3 Following such termination under Section 19.5.1, Janssen\'s
indemnity obligations hereunder with respect to RPV supplied by a Third Party
to Gilead or manufactured by Gilead or its Affiliate with respect to the
applicable Territory Combination Product (and its incorporation into such
Territory Combination Product) shall apply (a) only with respect to any
country for which the Monthly Payment Term for such Territory Combination
Product remains in effect at the time of the sale of the at-issue Territory
Combination Product, and (b) only to the extent that any Losses are not
attributable to the fault of the Third Party that supplies RPV or Gilead or an
Affiliate of Gilead that manufactures RPV with respect to the applicable
Territory Combination Product. In the case of any termination of Janssen's
supply obligations with respect to a Territory Combination Product pursuant to
Section 19.5.1, the Parties shall coordinate in good faith to wind down
matters relating to the supply of RPV with respect to such Territory
Combination Product under the RPV Supply Agreement, including appropriate
disposition of any unused RPV then in Gilead\'s (or its Affiliates' or
Sublicensees') inventory to the extent not used or usable for
commercialization or otherwise by Gilead.

19.6.12 Expiration. Upon expiration of this Agreement with respect to a
Territory Combination Product in a given country, (a) for clarity, the Selling
Party shall not be required to withdraw such Territory Combination Product in
such country and all rights and licenses granted to the Selling Party under
this Agreement (including in Article 9 and in the Janssen Distributor
Agreement) with respect to such Territory Combination Product in such country
shall remain in effect and shall be fully paid-up and perpetual; provided,
however, that such rights and licenses shall remain subject to any Third Party
License Payments incurred with respect to sales of such Territory Combination
Product in such country after expiration of this Agreement in such country,
which Third Party License Payments shall be paid by the Selling Party, and (b)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) with respect
to any Supplied RPV used to Manufacture any quantity of such Territory
Combination Product that is subject to a Triggering Sale by Gilead or its
Affiliate or Sublicensee in such country after such expiration, Gilead shall
pay to Janssen an amount equal to [*] and (ii) with respect to any quantity of
such Territory Combination Product that is subject to a Triggering Sale by
Janssen or its Affiliate in such country after such expiration, Janssen shall
pay to Gilead an amount equal to [*].

19.7 Accrued Liabilities; Survival.

19.7.1 Expiration or termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part, shall
be without prejudice to any liabilities that shall have accrued prior to such
expiration or termination or any remedies to which either Party may be
entitled. Such expiration or termination shall not relieve a Party from
obligations that are expressly indicated to survive such expiration or
termination of this Agreement. In the event that there are any outstanding
credit notes that were issued pursuant to this Agreement as of the date of any
such expiration or termination, the issuing Party shall pay, promptly and in
no event later than forty-five (45) days after such expiration or termination,
to the non-issuing Party the amount set forth in such outstanding credit notes
and, upon such payment, such notes shall no longer be in effect.

Applicable Law. If this Agreement expires with respect to fewer than all of
the countries in the Territory, then neither Party shall have any rights
hereunder to Exploit the Territory Combination Product in the countries for
which this Agreement expired, and the Parties' respective rights and
obligations under this Agreement as they relate to such expired countries
shall remain in effect only as described above in this Section 19.7, but the

to the non-expired countries. Upon expiration of this Agreement with respect
to all countries in the Territory, this Section 19.7.3 shall apply to all

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

20.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be deemed to have defaulted under or
breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any
term of this Agreement, except for the payment of any amounts under this
Agreement, when such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes
beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires,
floods, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war
(whether war be declared or not), terrorism, insurrections, riots, civil
commotion, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any
governmental authority (each, a "Force Majeure Event"). The non-performing
Party shall notify the other Party of such Force Majeure Event within five (5)
days after such occurrence by giving written notice to the other Party stating
the nature of the event, its anticipated duration, and any action being taken
to avoid or minimize its effect. The suspension of performance shall be of no
greater scope and no longer duration than is necessary and the non-performing
Party shall use, throughout the period of suspension of performance,
commercially reasonable efforts to remedy its inability to perform; provided,
however, that in the event the suspension of performance continues for ninety
(90) days after the date such Force Majeure Event commences, the Parties shall
meet to discuss in good faith how to proceed in order to accomplish the
objectives of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement a Force Majeure
Event shall not include a failure to commit sufficient resources, financial or
otherwise, to the activities to be conducted pursuant to this Agreement or
general market or economic conditions.

20.2 Notice. All notices, requests, reports, statements and other
communications to either Party shall be in writing, shall refer specifically

recognized overnight courier or sent by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to the following respective addresses (or

Any such communication shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered,
if personally delivered during the recipient's normal business hours, (b) on
the Business Day after dispatch, if sent by nationally-recognized overnight
courier and proof of delivery is obtained, and (c) on the third (3rd) Business
Day following the date of mailing, if sent by mail. It is understood and
agreed that this Section 20.2 is not intended to govern the day-to-day
business communications necessary between the Parties in performing their
duties, in due course, under the terms of this Agreement. Whenever this
Agreement requires or permits the giving of notice by or to Gilead, such
notice may be given by or to Gilead Parent on behalf of Gilead.

20.3 Further Assurances. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such
further instruments and do and cause to be done such further ministerial,
administrative or similar acts and things, including the filing of such
assignments, agreements, documents and instruments, as may be necessary, or as
the other Party may reasonably request, to carry out more effectively the
provisions and

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

purposes hereof, or to better assure and confirm unto such other Party its
rights and remedies under this Agreement.

20.4 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions hereof shall inure to
the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly permitted in this
Agreement, neither Party may, without the prior written consent of the other
Party, assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights and interests or
subcontract or otherwise delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either Party, without such consent, may
assign its rights and delegate its duties under this Agreement to an Affiliate
which is a directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Parent or
Janssen Parent, as the case may be, provided that, except as set forth in
clause (ii) below, such assignment or delegation to an Affiliate shall
terminate automatically at such time, if any, as such Affiliate ceases to be
wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by Gilead Parent or Janssen Parent, as
the case may be, unless such Affiliate owns substantially all the assets of
Gilead or Janssen, as the case may be, that are described in clause (ii)(A) of
this Section 20.4, respectively, and (ii) each of Gilead and Janssen, without
the prior written consent of the other, may assign its rights and delegate its
duties under this Agreement, whether by contract or operation of law, (A) to
any Third Party that acquires (through the purchase of assets, stock or
otherwise) substantially all of the assets of such Party [*], or (B) in
connection with a merger or consolidation of (1) in the case of Gilead as the
assigning Party, Gilead Parent, or (2) in the case of Janssen as the assigning
Party, Janssen, in each case ((1) and (2)), with or into any Third Party, to
such Third Party or to the surviving entity in such merger or consolidation
with such Third Party. For purposes of clause (ii)(A) of this Section 20.4,
"Party" shall refer to the applicable Party and those of its Affiliates that
have been or are anticipated to be engaged in the activities hereunder. Any
purported assignment, transfer, subcontract or delegation by either Party in
violation of the terms of this Section 20.4 shall be null and void and of no
legal effect. In the event that a Party delegates any of its obligations under
this Agreement to a subcontractor, or makes any other assignment of this
Agreement (other than pursuant to clause (ii)(B) above), the delegating or
assigning Party shall remain primarily (and not secondarily or derivatively)
liable for the full and timely performance by such subcontractor or assignee
of all such Party's obligations under this Agreement. For clarity, for
purposes of this Agreement, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates shall
constitute a subcontractor of the other Party or any of its Affiliates and no
activity performed by a Party or its Affiliates shall be deemed performed "on
behalf" of the other Party.

20.5 Governing Law. The interpretation, construction and performance of this
Agreement, the rights granted and obligations arising hereunder, shall be
governed in accordance with the substantive laws of New York, exclusive of its
conflicts of law rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
interpretation and construction of any Patents shall be governed in accordance
with the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Patents were filed or granted,
as the case may be.

20.6 Dispute Resolution.

20.6.4 Escalation. If the Parties, their Affiliates or the Alliance Managers
do not reach agreement with respect to any matter within five (5) Business
Days of such matter being referred to them, and such matter (a) relates to or
arises out of this Agreement, including any such matter which requires a
determination as to the validity (including any claim of inducement of this
Agreement by fraud or otherwise), application, interpretation or construction
of, or the compliance with or breach of, or termination of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, (b) requires their mutual agreement hereunder or
under an Ancillary Agreement, or (c) is designated hereunder or under any
Ancillary Agreement for decision by the Parties or their respective Affiliates
or the Alliance Managers (a "Dispute"), then, unless this Agreement expressly
provides otherwise, either Party may refer such Dispute for resolution to the
Executives. For clarity, a decision of the Executives shall not constitute an
amendment to this Agreement unless executed in writing and signed by the duly
authorized representatives of each Party.

20.6.5 Resolution of Dispute Following Escalation. If the Executives do not
reach agreement on a Dispute referred to them within ten (10) Business Days
after such referral (the "Executives Review Period"), then the following
provisions of this Section 20.6.2 shall apply.

20.6.5.1 Disputes Subject to Final Decision-Making Authority. Unless (a) this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement expressly requires the mutual agreement
of the Parties or the Alliance Managers with respect to the matter that is the
subject of such Dispute, (b) this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
expressly requires a Party's or its Alliance Manager's consent or approval
with respect to the matter that is the subject of such Dispute, (c) the
Dispute is an Arbitration Matter or (d) the Dispute is an Expert Dispute or
Patent Matter, then (i) subject to any other provisions of this Agreement and
any applicable Ancillary Agreement, Gilead shall have final decision-making
authority with respect to such Dispute to the extent (x) [*] and (y) Gilead is
granted final decision-making authority in Sections 3.6.5, and, for the Gilead
Countries, 13.2.2 (regarding the conduct of the applicable recall or
withdrawal); (ii) subject to any other provisions of this Agreement and any
applicable Ancillary Agreement, including the RPV Supply Agreement, Janssen
shall have final decision-making authority with respect to such Dispute to the
extent (x) [*] and (y) Janssen is granted final decision-making authority in
Sections 3.6.4 and, for the Janssen Countries, 13.2.2 (regarding the conduct
of the applicable recall or withdrawal); and (iii) subject to Article 14, each
Party shall have final decision-making authority with respect to the
prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of its intellectual
property. For clarity, Disputes identified in clauses (a), (b) or (d) of this
Section 20.6.2.1 shall not be considered Arbitration Matters subject to
resolution under Section 20.7.

20.6.5.2 Matters Requiring Mutual Agreement or Consent. If (a) this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement expressly requires the mutual agreement of the
Parties or the Alliance Managers with respect to the matter that is the
subject of such Dispute or (b) this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
expressly requires a Party's or its Alliance Manager's consent or approval
with respect to the matter that is the subject of such Dispute, then such
Dispute shall remain unresolved to the extent such Dispute requires such
mutual agreement,

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

consent or approval unless and until the Parties or Alliance Managers reach
mutual agreement, or the Party or its Alliance Manager gives its consent or
approval, as applicable. For avoidance of doubt, an impasse between the
Parties (or the Parties' Alliance Managers) regarding any matter with respect
to which a Party (or its Alliance Manager) has the right hereunder to withhold
its (or their) consent, in such Party's sole discretion or judgment, or any
matter that is otherwise committed to the sole discretion or judgment of a
Party hereunder, shall not be subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 20.7.
In the event of any such impasse described in clause (a) or (b), no action
with respect to such matter shall be taken without the agreement or consent of
a Party whose agreement or consent is required hereunder or to whose
discretion such action is committed, and no action of one Party that has the
right to conduct such action hereunder may be blocked by the other Party
unless its agreement or consent thereto is required hereunder.

20.6.5.3 Expert Disputes. If the Dispute is designated in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement as an Expert Dispute, then the Parties shall refer the
dispute to the applicable primary Expert selected pursuant to Section 20.6.3
or if unavailable, the applicable alternate Expert. Within five (5) Business
Days after the applicable Expert is engaged with respect to such Expert
Dispute, each Party shall provide such Expert and the other Party with a
written summary of such Party's position with respect to the Expert Dispute,
along with any relevant evidence in support thereof. The Expert shall make a
final decision with respect to the Expert Dispute within five (5) Business
Days following receipt of the Parties' written summaries. The decision by the
Expert shall be final and binding, and not subject to appeal of any kind.

20.6.5.4 Patent Matters. To the extent the Dispute is a Patent Matter, then
either Party may refer such Patent Matter for resolution pursuant to Section
20.8.2.

20.6.5.5 Arbitration Matters. To the extent the Dispute is an Arbitration
Matter, then either Party may refer such Arbitration Matter to binding
arbitration pursuant to Section 20.7.

20.6.6 Selection of Expert(s). Within sixty (60) days after the Restatement
Effective Date, the Parties shall agree upon a list of one or more mutually
acceptable, disinterested, conflict-of-interest free individuals who have
expertise relevant to, and knowledge of, matters related to potential Expert
Disputes, which individual(s) (a) if agreed by the Parties, may be assigned to
one or more categories of Expert Disputes, and (b) to the extent there is more
than one of such individuals (if applicable, for any category of Expert
Dispute), shall be designated as either a primary Expert or an alternate
Expert (each such individual, an "Expert").

20.6.7 Remedies. Nothing in this Section 20.6 is intended to, or shall limit
or modify, either Party's rights under Section 15.6 or Section 20.7.8 to seek
injunctive relief.

20.7 Arbitration.

20.7.1 Arbitration Matters shall be referred initially to the Executives as
provided in Section 20.6. If such Arbitration Matter is not resolved as
provided in Section 20.6, then, unless the Parties agree in writing to
alternate provisions, such Arbitration Matter shall be

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by Judicial and
Mediation Services "JAMS") (or any successor entity thereto) and in accordance
with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect, except
where those rules conflict with these provisions, in which case these
provisions control. The arbitration will be held in New York, New York.

20.7.2 The panel shall consist of three arbitrators appointed in accordance
with Section 20.7.3 (unless the Parties agree on the selection of the
arbitrators), each of whom shall be a lawyer with at least fifteen (15) years'
experience with a law firm or corporate law department of over twenty-five
(25) lawyers or who was a judge of a court of general jurisdiction. In the
event the aggregate damages sought by the claimant are stated to be less than
five million U.S. dollars ($5,000,000), and the aggregate damages sought by
the counterclaimant are stated to be less than five million U.S. dollars
($5,000,000), and neither side seeks equitable relief, then a single
arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with Section 20.7.3, having the same
qualifications and experience specified above. Each arbitrator shall be
impartial and independent of the Parties and shall abide by the Code of Ethics
for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes (available at
http://www.adr.org/EthicsAndStandards).

20.7.3 In the event the Parties cannot agree upon selection of the
arbitrator(s), JAMS will select arbitrator(s) as follows: JAMS shall provide
the Parties with a list of no less than twenty-five (25) proposed arbitrators
(fifteen (15) if a single arbitrator is to be selected) having the credentials
referenced above. Within fifteen (15) days of receiving such list, the Parties
shall rank at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the proposed arbitrators on
the initial JAMS list, after exercising cause challenges. The Parties may then
jointly interview the five candidates (three if a single arbitrator is to be
selected) with the highest combined rankings for no more than one hour each
and, following the interviews, may exercise one peremptory challenge each. The
panel will consist of the remaining three candidates (or one, if one
arbitrator is to be selected) with the highest combined rankings. In the event
these procedures fail to result in selection of the required number of
arbitrators, JAMS shall select the appropriate number of arbitrators (having
the credentials referenced above), allowing each side challenges for cause and
one peremptory challenge each.

20.7.4 The Parties agree to cooperate (i) to attempt to select the
arbitrator(s) by agreement within thirty (30) days of initiation of the
arbitration, including jointly interviewing the final candidates, (ii) to meet
with the arbitrator(s) within thirty (30) days of selection and (iii) to agree
at that meeting or before upon procedures for discovery and as to the conduct
of the hearing which will result in the hearing being concluded within no more
than six (6) months after selection of the arbitrator(s) and in the award
being rendered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the hearings, or of
any post‑hearing briefing, which briefing will be completed by both sides
within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearings.

20.7.5 In the event the Parties cannot agree upon procedures for discovery and
conduct of the hearing that meet the schedule set forth in Section 20.7.4,
then the arbitrator(s) shall set dates for the hearing, any post‑hearing
briefing, and the issuance of the award following the schedule set forth in
Section 20.7.4 as closely as practical. The arbitrator(s) shall provide for

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

discovery according to those time limits, giving recognition to the
understanding of the Parties that they contemplate reasonable discovery,
including document demands and depositions, but that such discovery will be
limited so that the schedule set forth in Section 20.7.4 may be met without
difficulty. In no event will the arbitrator(s), absent agreement of the
Parties, allow more than ten (10) days for the hearing. Multiple hearing days
will be scheduled consecutively to the greatest extent possible. The
arbitrator(s) shall have power to exclude evidence on grounds of hearsay,
prejudice beyond its probative value, redundancy, or irrelevance and no award
shall be overturned by reason of any ruling on evidence. A transcript of the
testimony adduced at the hearing shall be made and shall, upon request, be
made available to either Party.

20.7.6 The arbitrator(s) are expressly empowered to decide dispositive motions
in advance of any hearing, including but not limited to motions to dismiss and
motions for summary judgment, and shall endeavor to decide such motions as
would a federal district judge sitting in the State of New York.

20.7.7 The arbitrator(s) shall decide the issues presented in accordance with
the governing law set forth in Section 20.5. The arbitrator(s) shall render a
written opinion stating the reasons upon which the award is based. To the
extent possible, the arbitration hearings and award will be maintained in
confidence.

20.7.8 Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 20.7, shall preclude
either Party from seeking interim or provisional relief, including a temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim equitable relief
concerning a Dispute with the other Party, either prior to or during the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 20.7, if necessary to
protect the interests of such Party.

20.7.9 EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY CLAIM OF DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH
DAMAGES ARE PRECLUDED PURSUANT TO SECTION 18.8.

20.7.10 EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY CLAIM FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS FROM
THE OTHER (but for clarity, such waiver is not intended to limit a Party's
right to indemnification for Proceedings and Losses under Article 18).

20.7.11 EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY.

20.8 Consent to Jurisdiction.

20.8.1 Each Party, for the purpose of enforcing an award under Section 20.7 or
for seeking interim or provisional relief as contemplated in Section 20.7.8
with respect to any breach of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive (or in the case of such interim or
provisional relief or the enforcement of judgments or court orders, non-
exclusive) jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the City of
New York, State of New York (the "Court"), and (ii) agrees not to raise any
objection at any time to the laying or maintaining of the venue of any action,
suit or proceeding for such purpose in any

such Court, irrevocably waives any claim that such action, suit or other
proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, including any forum non
conveniens argument, and further irrevocably waives the right to object, with
respect to such action, suit or other proceeding, that such Court does not
have any jurisdiction over such Party. Each Party further agrees that service
of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such
Party's notice address provided for in this Agreement shall be effective
service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in the Court with
respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this
Section 20.8.1.

20.8.2 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Patent
Matter with respect to a given Patent shall be subject to adjudication in
accordance with the laws of the country in which such Patent is pending or has
been issued. The Parties agree that the venue of any such adjudication
involving a Patent pending in or issued by the United States shall be a U.S.
federal district court sitting in the City of New York, State of New York, and
for a Patent pending in or issued by any other country, any competent court
having jurisdiction over the subject of the Patent Matter sitting in the
capital of such country (or if there is not any such competent court in the
capital, a location reasonably proximate to the capital) and each Party
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such court. Each Party agrees not
to raise any objection at any time to the laying or maintaining of the venue
of any action, suit or proceeding for such purpose in any such court,
irrevocably waives any claim that such action, suit or other proceeding has
been brought in an inconvenient forum, including any forum non conveniens
argument, and further irrevocably waives the right to object, with respect to
such action, suit or other proceeding, that such court does not have any
jurisdiction over such Party.

20.9 Waiver. A Party's failure to enforce, at any time or for any period of
time, any provision of this Agreement, or to exercise any right or remedy,
does not constitute a waiver of such provision, right or remedy, or prevent
such Party thereafter from enforcing any or all provisions and exercising any
or all rights and remedies. The exercise of any right or remedy does not
constitute an election or prevent the exercise of any or all rights or
remedies, all rights and remedies being cumulative.

20.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, then, to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law, (a) all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force
and effect and shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the intent
of the Parties as nearly as may be possible, and (b) the Parties agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a provision, in replacement of
the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is consistent with
Applicable Law and accomplishes, as nearly as possible, the original intention
of the Parties with respect thereto.

20.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same instrument.

20.12 Construction. Except where the context otherwise requires, wherever used
the singular shall include the plural, the plural the singular, and the use of
any gender shall be applicable to all genders. The words "hereof" and
"hereunder", and words of similar import,

BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





shall be construed to refer to this Agreement (including the Annexes hereto)
as an entirety and not to any particular provision. The word "including" as
used herein shall mean, including, without limiting the generality of any
description preceding such term. Thus, e.g., "including" shall be interpreted
as meaning "including without limitation" or "including but not limited to",
regardless of whether the words "without limitation" or "but not limited to"
actually follow the term "including". Similarly, the terms "such as", "for
example", and "e.g." shall be understood as referring to non-limiting
illustrations or examples. The word "or" is used in the inclusive sense
(and/or). Any reference to a supranational, national, federal, state, local,
or foreign statute or law shall be understood to refer to the applicable
version of the law or statute then in force (as it may have been amended or
superseded) as well as all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise. All references to "dollars" or "$"
shall mean United States dollars, and all references to "€" shall mean Euros.
The captions of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no
way define, describe, extend or limit the scope or intent of this Agreement or
the intent of any provision contained in this Agreement. Any reference in this
Agreement to a matter or action being subject to the "mutual agreement" or
"mutual consultation" of the Parties, or words of similar import, shall not be
construed as an agreement that the Parties shall agree to such matter or
action. The language of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
mutually chosen by the Parties and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against either Party.

20.13 Status of the Parties. Neither Party shall have the right to enter into
any agreements or take action on behalf of the other Party, nor shall it
represent to any Person that it has any such right or authority. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as establishing a partnership or joint
venture relationship between the Parties.

20.14 Entire Agreement.

20.14.1 Subject to Section 11.10, as of the Restatement Effective Date, this
Agreement shall amend and restate in its entirety the Original Agreement;
provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 20.17, such amendment
and restatement shall not affect any rights or obligations of the Parties that
accrued under the Original Agreement prior to the Restatement Effective Date.
For clarity, (i) the provisions of this Agreement with respect to TAF,
including any provisions of this Agreement with respect to the R/F/TAF
Product, shall have no application to any period prior to the Restatement
Effective Date and (ii) except as provided in Section 20.17, the provisions of
this Agreement to the extent different from the provisions of the Original
Agreement shall have no application to any period prior to the Restatement
Effective Date.

20.14.2 Subject to Section 20.14.1, this Agreement (including the Annexes
hereto), together with the Ancillary Agreements executed on or before the
Restatement Effective Date by the Parties that remain in effect after the
Restatement Effective Date, constitutes, on and as of the Restatement
Effective Date, the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and all prior or contemporaneous understandings or
agreements between Gilead, on the one hand, and Janssen, on the other hand,
whether written or oral, with respect to such subject matter are hereby
superseded in their entireties; provided, however, that (a) the

EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

CDA shall be superseded solely to the extent applicable to the subject matter
of this Agreement and (b) certain other agreements and side letters shall
terminate, remain in effect or be modified as separately mutually agreed by
the Parties in a written instrument dated as of the date hereof. This
Agreement shall not be amended in any respect whatsoever except by a further
agreement, in writing, fully executed by Gilead and Janssen.

20.15 Third Parties. Except as set forth in Article 18 as to those Third
Parties expressly referred to therein, the agreements, covenants, warranties
and representations contained herein are for the benefit of the Parties only
and are not for the benefit of any Third Parties.

20.16 Guarantee. Janssen shall cause Janssen Pharmaceutica NV to deliver to
Gilead a letter in substantially the form of Annex U-1, and Gilead Parent
shall deliver to Janssen, a letter in substantially the form of Annex U-2, in
each case confirming that the guarantee agreement delivered by it under the
Original Agreement covers this Agreement.

20.17 Prior Diligence. Janssen agrees not to assert any claim that Gilead
failed to used Commercially Reasonable Efforts to conduct any activities that
it was required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to conduct under the
Original Agreement prior to the Restatement Effective Date.

Annex M-6

Revaluation of API

Within fifteen (15) Business Days following December 31, 2014, Janssen shall
provide Gilead with an invoice (or credit note) with respect to each Pre-
Conversion Invoice (or portion thereof) for which a Triggering Sale for
Territory Complera has not yet occurred with respect to the Supplied RPV
Annual Revaluation for Calendar Year 2014 (such invoice, the "Revaluation Pre-
Conversion Invoice") as set forth below. For such purpose, such Triggering
Sales shall be mapped to the earliest Pre-Conversion Invoices (or portion
thereof) for Supplied RPV and for Territory Complera on a first-in, first-out
basis so that the oldest outstanding invoices are paid first. The "Supplied
RPV Annual Revaluation" due (or creditable) with respect to each Pre-
Conversion Invoice shall be the amount in U.S. Dollars determined by
multiplying the Revaluation RPV Supply Price by the kilograms of Supplied RPV
sold to Gilead under the applicable invoice for which a Triggering Sale did
not occur during Calendar Year 2014 or any previous Calendar Year. If the
Supplied RPV Annual Revaluation amount is negative, then Janssen (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall issue a credit note for such amount and if the
Supplied RPV Annual Revaluation amount is positive, then Janssen shall invoice
Gilead for such amount. Any credit note shall be issued to the entity (Gilead
or the Gilead Affiliate) initially invoiced for the quantity of Supplied RPV
in question and shall only be creditable against amounts owed by the entity
(Gilead or the Gilead Affiliate) to which the credit note was issued.

GILEAD ANNOUNCES AMENDED AGREEMENTS WITH JANSSEN TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE
TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE-BASED SINGLE TABLET REGIMENS FOR HIV TREATMENT



Foster City, CA, December XX, 2014 - Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD)
today announced an expansion to its agreement with Janssen RandD Ireland for the
development and commercialization of a new once-daily single tablet regimen
containing Gilead's tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) and emtricitabine,
and Janssen's rilpivirine. The original agreement was established in 2009 for
the development and commercialization of Complera®, marketed as Eviplera® in
the European Union, which combines tenofovir disoproxil fumarate,
emtricitabine and rilpivirine in a once-daily tablet. Gilead will initiate
Phase 3 studies of emtricitabine/rilpivirine/TAF in the coming months. Pending
the product's approval, Gilead will be responsible for the manufacturing,
registration, distribution and commercialization of the regimen in most
countries, while Janssen will distribute in approximately 17 markets.



TAF is a novel nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that has
demonstrated high antiviral efficacy at a dose 10 times lower than Gilead's
Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), as well as an improved renal and bone
safety profile.



"We believe that TAF's efficacy and safety advantages may make it a strong
backbone of new fixed-dose combinations and single tablet regimens," said
Norbert Bischofberger, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research and Development
and Chief Scientific Officer, Gilead Sciences. "Gilead is pleased to continue
its collaboration with Janssen to bring improved treatment options to patients
living with HIV."



Gilead and Janssen also have amended a licensing agreement for the development
and commercialization of a once-daily single tablet regimen for HIV containing
Gilead's TAF, emtricitabine and cobicistat, and Janssen's darunavir. Under the
amended agreement, Janssen will be responsible for further development of the
regimen and, subject to regulatory approval, the manufacturing, registration,
distribution and commercialization of the product worldwide.



Separate to the Janssen agreements, Gilead is advancing its own TAF-based
single tablet regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and
TAF. The company announced on November 6, 2014, it filed for regulatory
approval in the United States.



TAF and TAF-based regimens are investigational products in the United States
and have not yet been determined safe or efficacious in humans.

Forward-Looking Statement

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to
risks, uncertainties and other factors, including risks related to whether
ongoing clinical trials of TAF-based combinations will be successful and
Gilead's ability to coformulate new single tablet regimens containing TAF,
emtricitabine and rilpivirine, and TAF, emtricitabine, cobicistat and
darunavir. In addition, Gilead and Janssen may make a strategic decision to
discontinue development of the TAF combination products if, for example, the
market for the products fails to materialize as expected. As a result, the
agreements may terminate. Further, regulatory authorities may not approve TAF-
based regimens, and marketing approvals, if granted, may have significant
limitations on their use. As a result, TAF combination products may never be
successfully commercialized. These risks, uncertainties and other factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to in the
forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these
forward-looking statements. These and other risks are described in detail in
Gilead's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2014, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-
looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and
Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.

JANSSEN ANNOUNCES COLLABORATION WITH GILEAD TO DEVELOP 
PREZISTA®-BASED SINGLE-TABLET REGIMEN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH
HIV

\-- TWO COMPANIES TO ALSO COLLABORATE ON THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLERA®,
MARKETED AS EVIPLERA® IN THE EUROPEAN UNION --

Cork, Ireland, [XX] December 2014 - Janssen RandD Ireland (Janssen) announced
today an amendment to its existing agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc.
(Gilead), initially established in 2011, for the development of a once daily,
darunavir-based, single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of people
living with HIV. This new STR contains a combination of darunavir (PREZISTA®),
cobicistat (TYBOST®), emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF).
A number of Phase 1 and 2 studies of the new STR have been completed. Under
this amended agreement, Janssen will conduct all further clinical development
of the regimen and, subject to regulatory approval, will be responsible for
all manufacturing, registration, distribution and commercialization of the
product worldwide.

UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





If successfully developed and approved by regulatory authorities, this
treatment would represent the first protease inhibitor-based STR and thereby
continue Janssen's commitment to providing its HIV products in more simplified
dosing presentations.



"Janssen has vast experience in developing and making innovative HIV
treatments available to patients and we have engaged in several successful
collaborations with Gilead. We are proud to be extending our collaboration and
leading the development of this darunavir-based single-tablet regimen," says
Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer and Worldwide Chairman,
Pharmaceuticals, Johnson and Johnson. "Our ultimate goal is to offer new
treatment options for people living with HIV. If approved, this STR has the
potential to provide additional choice in the form of another one pill, once a
day, as a new and simplified regimen."



In addition to this collaboration, Janssen and Gilead have also expanded a
separate agreement initiated in 2009 regarding the approved single-tablet
regimen, COMPLERA®, marketed as EVIPLERA® in the European Union (EU)
(rilpivirine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine). This
expanded agreement will allow for Gilead's investigational novel pro-drug
tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) to replace TDF within COMPLERA®/
EVIPLERA®. TAF has been shown in clinical trials to have a better renal and
bone safety profile than TDF.1 Gilead will be responsible for the development
and commercialization in most countries, while Janssen will lead the
commercialization in select markets.

Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, almost 75 million people have been
infected with the HIV virus.2 It is estimated that 35 million people are
currently living with HIV globally, with 2.5 million people becoming newly
infected each year.2,3,4

PREZISTA®

Indication

PREZISTA® (darunavir), coadministered with ritonavir (PREZISTA®/r), and with
other antiretroviral agents (ARVs), is indicated for the treatment of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.



This indication is based on analyses of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ cell
counts from 2 controlled Phase 3 trials of 48 weeks duration in ARV treatment-
naive and treatment-experienced patients and 2 controlled Phase 2 trials of 96
weeks duration in clinically advanced, treatment-experienced adult patients.

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED

UNDER 17 C.F.R. §§ 200.80(b)(4) AND 240.24B-2





In treatment-experienced adult patients, the following points should be
considered when initiating therapy with PREZISTA®/r:

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Treatment history and, when available, genotypic or phenotypic testing should
guide the use of PREZISTA®/r 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

The use of other active agents with PREZISTA®/r is associated with a greater
likelihood of treatment response 

 

Important Safety Information



PREZISTA® (darunavir) is a prescription medicine. It is one treatment option
in the class of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) medicines known as protease
inhibitors.



PREZISTA® is always taken with and at the same time as ritonavir (Norvir®), in
combination with other HIV medicines for the treatment of HIV infection in
adults. PREZISTA® should also be taken with food.

| 
---|--- 

•

|

The use of other medicines active against HIV in combination with
PREZISTA®/ritonavir (Norvir®) may increase your ability to fight HIV. Your
healthcare professional will work with you to find the right combination of
HIV medicines 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

It is important that you remain under the care of your healthcare professional
during treatment with PREZISTA® 

PREZISTA® does not cure HIV infection or AIDS and you may continue to
experience illnesses associated with HIV-1 infection, including opportunistic
infections. You should remain under the care of a doctor when using PREZISTA®.

the Collaboration Agreement and this JDA, and (b) Janssen shall be Gilead's
exclusive distributor of, and shall have the exclusive right to Distribute,
Territory Combination Product in such country. The Supply Committee shall
determine the commencement date for Manufacture and sale to Janssen under this
JDA of Major Market R/F/TAF Product, Branded Region B/C Complera and Branded
Region B/C R/F/TAF Product, including any required Manufacture of validation
batches required by Applicable Law, provided that the Parties understand and
agree that Gilead shall require at least five (5) months' advance notice to
Manufacture any such required validation batches and commence Manufacture of
Branded Region B/C Complera or Branded Region B/C R/F/TAF Product. In the
event that the Supply Committee cannot reach agreement with respect to the
commencement date for Manufacture and sale to Janssen under this JDA of
Branded Region B/C Complera and Branded Region B/C R/F/TAF Product, then
Gilead shall commence such Manufacture and sale on the date reasonably
requested by Janssen and in no event earlier than the date on which Gilead is
commencing commercial manufacture of the applicable Territory Combination
Product for use by Gilead in the Gilead Countries.

2.2Minimum Shelf Life. To ensure that minimum remaining shelf life
requirements of Territory Combination Product in the Janssen Countries can be
met by Janssen at the time of delivery in such Janssen Countries, [*] if
Gilead Delivers any Territory Combination Product with less than the remaining
shelf life specified in clause (i) above ("Deficient Territory Combination
Product"), Janssen shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell (and to
cause its Affiliates to sell) such Territory Combination Product [*]. For
clarity, the percent remaining shelf life at the time of Delivery shall be
calculated by the formula ((a-b)/a)*100, where "a" is the approved shelf life
of the applicable Territory Combination Product (as described above), and "b"
is the time elapsed between the date of completion of Manufacture (as defined
by Applicable Law for purposes of establishing shelf life) and the date of
Delivery. Prior to the Delivery of any Deficient Territory Combination
Product, Gilead shall provide notice to the Supply Committee of its intent to
Deliver such Deficient Territory Combination Product and the Supply Committee
shall discuss whether such Deficient Territory Combination Product can
reasonably be sold in any of the Janssen Countries by Janssen or its
Affiliates. In addition, the Supply Committee shall coordinate regarding the
Parties' rights and obligations under this Section 2.2 and any special needs
of Janssen regarding shelf life for Territory Combination Product for
particular jurisdictions. Provided that Janssen uses such efforts as described
in clause (ii) above, Janssen shall notify Gilead in writing on an annual
basis of any Deficient Territory Combination Product that it is unable to sell
notwithstanding the exercise of

5.1Notice of Nonconformity. Janssen shall notify Gilead in writing of any
claim that any Territory Combination Product supplied under this JDA is not in
conformance with the warranties set forth in Section 11.1 ("Nonconforming")
within thirty (30) days after Delivery thereof (or within thirty (30) days
after discovery of any Nonconformity that could not reasonably have been
detected by inspection on receipt at the applicable Janssen Destination).
Janssen shall promptly provide Gilead with a sample of such Nonconforming
Territory Combination Product, if available, and all relevant reports, data,
and laboratory test results indicating that such Territory Combination Product
is Nonconforming. Janssen shall have the option to require that Gilead use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to replace such potentially Nonconforming
Territory Combination Product as promptly as possible by placing a Firm Order
therefor. Janssen shall be liable to pay for such Firm Order unless and until
it shall have been determined by the independent testing laboratory described
below, or by agreement of the Parties, that the Territory Combination Product
in question was Nonconforming. If Gilead and Janssen disagree as to whether
Units of Territory Combination Product are Nonconforming, Gilead and Janssen
shall designate an independent testing laboratory reasonably acceptable to
both Parties to make a determination, which determination shall be binding on
the Parties, absent manifest error. Gilead shall bear the costs of such
laboratory testing if such Territory Combination Product is determined to be
Nonconforming (other than due to non-conforming Supplied RPV), and otherwise
Janssen shall bear such costs. The Parties shall attempt to resolve any
Nonconformity issue within ninety (90) days after Janssen notifies Gilead that
any Territory Combination Product is Nonconforming.

5.2Replacement of Nonconforming Territory Combination Product. If the
independent testing laboratory (as set forth above) determines that any
Territory Combination Product was Nonconforming or the Parties agree that any
Territory Combination Product was Nonconforming, then Janssen shall have the
option to:

(a)if not previously done (as set forth above), require that Gilead use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to replace any Nonconforming Territory
Combination Product as promptly as possible by placing a Firm Order therefor;
or

(b)cancel the applicable Firm Order (or portion thereof) corresponding to the
Nonconforming Territory Combination Product.

In the case of clause (a) (if notwithstanding such efforts, and for reasons
other than a Force Majeure Event, Gilead does not so replace such
Nonconforming Territory Combination Product) or clause (b), (i) the Parties
shall make any necessary financial adjustments so that Janssen is not
obligated to pay for such cancelled Territory Combination Product, and (ii) as
Janssen's sole monetary remedy (but without limitation of Gilead's obligations
under Article 18 of the Collaboration Agreement) in the case of Nonconforming
Territory Combination Product, Gilead shall pay to Janssen any out-of-pocket,
documented non-recoverable costs or expenses reasonably incurred by Janssen
(or its Affiliates) as a result of any required rescheduling of the packaging
and labeling by Janssen's or its Affiliates' Contract Manufacturers of any

extent such Nonconforming Territory Combination Product was Nonconforming as a
result of Supplied RPV from Janssen or its Affiliates; provided, further, that
Janssen shall have notified Gilead of such Nonconformity within the thirty
(30) day period described above. Janssen shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to minimize any such costs and expenses incurred by Janssen for such
cancellation.

arrange for the destruction, return to Gilead or other disposal, at Gilead's
election, of any Nonconforming Territory Combination Product in compliance
with Gilead's instructions and Applicable Law. The reasonable, direct, out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of any such destruction, return or other disposal of
Nonconforming Territory Combination Product by Janssen pursuant to this
Section 5.3 shall be borne by Gilead; provided, however, that Janssen shall
bear all such costs to the extent such Territory Combination Product is
Nonconforming due to Supplied RPV from Janssen or its Affiliates.

SECTION 6

TERRITORY COMBINATION PRODUCT SHORTAGE; 
FAILURE TO SUPPLY

6.1Inadequate Delivered Quantity of Territory Combination Product. Janssen
shall notify Gilead in writing of any (i) failure to Deliver Territory

Territory Combination Product (as compared with the amount specified for
Delivery in the applicable Firm Order given by Janssen (as set forth above)),
in each case ((i) and (ii)), within thirty (30) days after Delivery (or
scheduled Delivery) thereof. In the event Gilead disagrees with any claim of
shortage by Janssen, each Party shall designate a representative to be present
at the inventorying of the at-issue Territory Combination Product, as
applicable, the results of which shall be binding on the Parties, absent
manifest error (and Gilead shall invoice Janssen solely based on such binding
results). Gilead shall Deliver any shortage amount (as agreed upon by the
Parties or determined by the inventorying) of Territory Combination Product,
as applicable, as promptly as reasonably possible. Further, as Janssen's sole
monetary remedy in the case of a delayed Delivery of Territory Combination
Product under this JDA, Gilead shall pay to Janssen any documented out-of-
pocket, non-recoverable costs or expenses reasonably incurred by Janssen (or
its Affiliates) as a result of any required rescheduling of the packaging and
labeling by Janssen's or its Affiliates' Contract Manufacturers for any

within thirty (30) days after the Delivery date specified in the applicable
Firm Order, provided that Janssen shall have notified Gilead of such shortfall
within such thirty (30) day period. [*].

injury, property damage and advertising liability, with minimum limits of not
less than $50,000,000 U.S., covering claims brought and suits served anywhere
in the world.

II. Janssen:

Janssen shall maintain, at its sole cost and expense, the following minimum
amounts of insurance coverage:

(A) Clinical Trials Liability Insurance: Insuring against claims for bodily
