limiting the  generality  of the preceding  sentence,  neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement  will  accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any stock
option or benefit,  or increase the amount or value of  compensation  or benefit
due to any current or former employee of RAML.

will use Commercially  Reasonable Efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions  and to do,  or  cause to be  done,  all  things  necessary,  proper  or
advisable  under  applicable  Laws  to  consummate  the  Acquisition  as soon as
practicable  after the Execution Date and (ii) obtain and maintain all Approvals
required to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity that

creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by any third party whose consent
or approval is sought in connection with the Acquisition.

         (b) In  furtherance  and  not in  limitation  of the  covenants  of the
Parties contained in Section 5.2(a), if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding,  including any  proceeding  by a private  party,  is instituted  (or

Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), or if any
statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative
order is enacted,  entered,  promulgated  or enforced by a  Governmental  Entity
which  would  make the  Acquisition  illegal  or  would  otherwise  prohibit  or
materially   impair  or  delay  the  consummation  of  the  Acquisition  or  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby,  each of the Parties shall  cooperate in all
respects

                                       32
<PAGE>

         with each other and use its respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts
         to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
         vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
         injunction or other action or order, whether temporary, preliminary or
         permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
         consummation of the Acquisition and to have such statute, rule,
         regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
         repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable. For purposes of this
         Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
         Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
         the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the regulations
         promulgated thereunder, and all other federal, state and foreign,
         statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and
         judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed or intended to
         regulate mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations
         applicable to SELLER, RAML, BUYER and/or the Acquisition.

          5.3 Covenant to Satisfy Conditions. SELLER will use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII of
this Agreement are satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control of
SELLER. BUYER will use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to ensure that the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII of this Agreement are satisfied, insofar as
such matters are within the control of BUYER. SELLER and BUYER further covenant
and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or
executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the Parties to
consummate the Acquisition, to use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
prevent or lift the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may
be.

           5.4    Breach Notice.

                  (a) If, prior to the Closing Date, SELLER obtains knowledge of
         the existence of a breach of any of SELLER's representations,
         warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, SELLER shall
         notify BUYER in writing of such information (the "Breach Notice")
         within the earlier of five (5) Business Days after such discovery or
         the day prior to the Closing Date. In the event that BUYER obtains
         knowledge of the existence of a breach of any of SELLER's
         representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement
         (by means other than receipt of a Breach Notice from SELLER), BUYER
         shall notify SELLER in writing of such information within the earlier
         of five (5) Business Days after such discovery or the day prior to the
         Closing Date and such notice shall constitute a Breach Notice for
         purposes of this Section. The Breach Notice shall contain reasonable
         details regarding the alleged breach and a good faith estimate by the
         notifying Party of the potential Losses resulting from such breach.

                 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
         the event (i) BUYER obtains knowledge after the Execution Date but on
         or prior to the Closing Date of a breach (by means other than receipt
         of a Breach Notice from SELLER) of any of SELLER's representations,
         warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and fails to timely
         deliver a Breach Notice, or (ii) BUYER shall have knowledge on or prior
         to the Execution Date of any such breach, and the Closing occurs, BUYER
         shall not be entitled to assert any right hereunder with respect to, or
         to assert any claim against

                                       33
<PAGE>

SELLER for Losses attributable to, and hereby waives, such breach and BUYER will
be deemed to fully release and forever discharge the SELLER Indemnified Parties
on account of any and all claims, demands or charges, known or unknown, with
respect to the same.

         (b) In the  event  the  breach  described  in a Breach  Notice  is of a
magnitude such that Losses  resulting from such breach (together with other such
breaches discovered by SELLER or BUYER with respect to which SELLER or BUYER, as
applicable,  has  delivered the requisite  Breach  Notice(s))  are agreed by the
Parties to be  reasonably  likely to be less than  Seven  Million  Five  Hundred
Thousand Dollars (US$7,500,000),  and SELLER fails to deliver to BUYER a written
undertaking  within  the  earlier of ten (10)  Business  Days of receipt of such
Breach Notice or the Closing Date,  that SELLER intends to cure such breach in a
reasonable  and  timely  manner,  BUYER may either (A) deduct the amount of such
estimated  Losses from the  Purchase  Price or (B) proceed  with the Closing and
pursue  indemnification  for  such  breach,  to the  extent  indemnification  is
available pursuant to the applicable provision of ARTICLE X.

         (c) In the  event  the  breach  described  in a Breach  Notice  is of a
magnitude such that Losses  resulting from such breach (together with other such
breaches discovered by SELLER or BUYER with respect to which SELLER or BUYER, as
applicable,  has  delivered the requisite  Breach  Notice(s))  are agreed by the
Parties to be between Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$7,500,000)
and Fifteen  Million  Dollars  (US$15,000,000),  and SELLER  fails to deliver to
BUYER a written  undertaking  within the  earlier of ten (10)  Business  Days of
receipt of such Breach Notice or the Closing Date,  that SELLER  intends to cure
such breach in a reasonable  and timely  manner,  (A) BUYER may  terminate  this
Agreement upon written  notice to SELLER,  or (B) BUYER may deduct the amount of
the Losses resulting from such breach from the Purchase Price.

         (d) In the  event  the  breach  described  in a Breach  Notice  is of a
magnitude such that Losses  resulting from such breach (together with other such
breaches discovered by SELLER or BUYER with respect to which SELLER or BUYER, as
applicable,  has  delivered the requisite  Breach  Notice(s))  are agreed by the
Parties as likely to exceed Fifteen Million Dollars (US$15,000,000),  and SELLER
fails to deliver to BUYER a written  undertaking  within the earlier of ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of such Breach Notice or the Closing Date,  that SELLER
intends to cure such  breach in a  reasonable  and timely  manner,  (A) BUYER or
SELLER may terminate this  Agreement upon written notice to the other Party,  or
(B) BUYER and SELLER  may  mutually  agree to deduct  the  agreed  amount of the
Losses resulting from such breach from the Purchase Price.

         (e) The Parties  agree to use all  reasonable  endeavors  and to act in
good faith to agree on a reasonable estimate of the Losses arising from a Breach
Notice given in accordance with this Section 5.4.

         (f)  BUYER's   sole  remedy  for  any  breach  by  SELLER  of  SELLER's
representations,  warranties  or  covenants  hereunder  of which  BUYER  obtains
knowledge

                                       34
<PAGE>

         prior to the Closing Date by notice from SELLER, or otherwise obtains
         knowledge of such breach, shall be as set forth in subsections (b) -
         (e) above and neither Party shall have any further obligation or
         liability to the other Party except for any obligations that survive
         termination of this Agreement in the event that the Agreement is
         terminated pursuant to subsections (c) or (d) above.

          5.5 Hart-Scott-Rodino Compliance. Each Party hereto agrees (i) to make
promptly, or to cause its Affiliates to make promptly, its respective filings,
if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof,
(ii) to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entity
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act, and (iii) to the extent agreed upon by the SELLER,
request early termination of the applicable waiting period. The SELLER and BUYER
shall split equally the fees or other payments to any Governmental Entity in
order to obtain any such authorization, consent, order or approval.

           5.6    Exclusivity.

         (a) After the Execution Date, SELLER shall not, directly or indirectly,
through any officer,  director,  employee,  representative or agent of SELLER or
any of its  subsidiaries  or Affiliates,  solicit or encourage the initiation of
(including  by  way  of  furnishing  information)  any  inquiries  or  proposals
regarding any merger,  sale of assets,  sale of  membership  interest or similar
transactions  involving RAML that if consummated would constitute an Alternative
Transaction  (as defined  below) (any of the  foregoing  inquiries  or proposals
being referred to herein as an  "Acquisition  Proposal").  Nothing  contained in
this Agreement  shall prevent SELLER from (i) furnishing  information to a third
party which has made a bona fide  Acquisition  Proposal that SELLER concludes in
good faith after consulting with a nationally recognized investment banking firm
would,  if  consummated,  constitute a Superior  Proposal (as defined below) not
solicited in violation of this Agreement, or (ii) subject to compliance with the
other terms of this Section 5.6,  including  Sections 5.6(c),  (d), (e) and (f),
considering  and  negotiating  a bona  fide  Acquisition  Proposal  that  SELLER
concludes in good faith after consulting with a nationally recognized investment
banking firm would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal not solicited
in violation of this Agreement.

         (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means any
of (i) a  transaction  pursuant to which any person (or group of persons)  other
than BUYER or its  Affiliates (a "Third  Party")  acquires or would acquire more
than 25% of the  outstanding  shares,  interests or units of any class of equity
securities  of RAML,  whether from SELLER or  otherwise,  (ii) a merger or other
business  combination  involving RAML pursuant to which any Third Party acquires
or would acquire more than 25% of the outstanding  equity  securities of RAML or
the entity surviving such merger or business combination,  (iii) any transaction
pursuant to which any Third Party  acquires or would  acquire  control of assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of
RAML and securities of the entity  surviving any merger or business  combination
including any of RAML's subsidiaries) of RAML, or any of its subsidiaries having
a fair market value (as determined by SELLER in good faith) equal to

                                       35
<PAGE>

         more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets of RAML and
         its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
         transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination,
         recapitalization or similar transaction involving RAML or any of its
         subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement.

         (c) For purposes of this  Agreement,  a "Superior  Proposal"  means any
proposal  made  by a  Third  Party  to  acquire,  directly  or  indirectly,  for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the equity securities
of RAML or all or  substantially  all the assets of RAML,  on terms which SELLER
reasonably  believes (after  consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized  reputation) to be more  favorable from a financial  point of view to
SELLER than the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement taking into account
at the  time  of  determination  any  changes  to the  financial  terms  of this
Agreement  proposed by BUYER.

         (d) SELLER shall notify BUYER  promptly (but in no event later than two
(2)  Business  Days)  after  receipt  of  any  Acquisition   Proposal,   or  any
modification  of or amendment to any  Acquisition  Proposal,  or any request for
nonpublic  information  relating  to RAML  in  connection  with  an  Acquisition
Proposal  or for  access  to the  properties,  books or  records  of RAML or any
subsidiary  by any Person  that  informs  SELLER or RAML that it is  considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to BUYER shall be made
in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition
Proposal or intending to make an Acquisition  Proposal or requesting  non-public
information  or access to the books and  records of RAML,  the terms of any such
Acquisition  Proposal or modification  or amendment to an Acquisition  Proposal,
and whether  SELLER or RAML is providing or intends to provide the person making
the Acquisition Proposal with access to information  concerning RAML as provided
in Section 5.6(a). SELLER and RAML shall keep BUYER fully informed, on a current
basis,  of any  material  changes  in the  status  and any  material  changes or
modifications in the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication
or request.  SELLER shall also  promptly  notify BUYER in writing,  if it enters
into negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal.

         (e)  SELLER  shall  immediately  cease and cause to be  terminated  any
existing  discussions  or  negotiations  with any  persons  (other  than  BUYER)
conducted  prior to the  Execution  Date with  respect to any of the  foregoing.
SELLER agrees not to release any third party from the confidentiality provisions
of any agreement to which SELLER is a party.

         (f) SELLER shall ensure that the  officers,  managers and  directors of
SELLER,  RAML and their Affiliates and any investment banker or other advisor or
representative  retained  by  SELLER  or  RAML  are  aware  of the  restrictions
described  in this  Section  5.6. It is  understood  that any  violation  of the
restrictions  set  forth  in this  Section  5.6 by any  such  officer,  manager,
director,  investment banker or other advisor or representative  shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 5.6 by SELLER.

         5.7  Termination of Severance  Policy.  SELLER agrees that,  during the
period from the  Execution  Date to the Closing,  SELLER shall cause RAML to (i)
terminate RAML's

                                       36
<PAGE>

Separation and Retirement Policy for the benefit of RAML's employees, and (ii)
enter into an Acknowledgement, Agreement and Release with each of its employees,
which agreements shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
BUYER, providing for the payment of a retention bonus to each employee actively
employed by RAML as of the six month anniversary of the Closing Date.

          5.8 Duty to Obtain Financing. BUYER covenants and agrees to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to satisfy the Financing Condition to complete
the Acquisition on terms acceptable to the Uranium Resources Board of Directors.
In the event that Uranium Resources undertakes a registered public offering of
its common stock in connection with the financing necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and in the event that BUYER does not
reasonably expect to satisfy the entire Financing Condition on or before June 1,
2008, SELLER agrees to purchase up to US$10 million in shares of common stock of
Uranium Resources at the same price paid by other investors in the offering made
to achieve the Financing Condition and agrees that such shares purchased by
SELLER shall be subject to a requirement that they not be sold for a period of
six (6) months after the Closing.

          5.9 Interim Financial Statements. SELLER agrees that during the period
from the Execution Date to the Closing, it shall prepare and deliver to BUYER,
at such times as it would otherwise do so in the ordinary course of business and
in compliance with IFRS, unaudited monthly financial statements in a form to be
agreed by the Parties, acting reasonably. Upon delivery of such financial
statements to BUYER, they shall be considered "Financial Statements" for
purposes of this Agreement. SELLER further agrees that during the period from
the Execution Date to the Closing, it shall provide Uranium Resources such
financial information as it may reasonably require in connection with its public
reporting requirements.

         5.10 Affiliate Agreements. SELLER covenants and agrees that it shall
cause RAML to terminate the affiliate agreements set forth on Schedule 3.26(a)
other than those service level agreements that shall remain in full force and
effect for a period of two months following the Closing Date pursuant to Section
6.8 hereof.

         5.11 Drill Logs. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date,
SELLER shall cause RAML to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to assist BUYER
in its efforts to obtain from Strathmore Resources (US) Ltd. ("Strathmore") the
drill logs and related data specifically related to the Ambrosia Lake site that
RAML sold to Strathmore pursuant to that certain letter agreement between RAML
and Strathmore, dated March 12, 2004.

         5.12 Remediation Trust Fund Amount and Escrow Fund Amount. BUYER
covenants and agrees on the Closing Date to deposit the Remediation Trust Fund
Amount with the Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Remediation Trust Agreement
and the Escrow Fund Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; provided that the total of the Remediation Trust Fund Amount
and the Escrow Fund Amount shall not exceed US$35,000,000.

         5.13 KGL Associates, Inc. SELLER covenants and agrees that prior to the
Closing Date, it will cause RAML to pay to KGL Associates, Inc ("KGL"):

                                       37
<PAGE>

         (a) any  amount  which  becomes  payable  to KGL under the terms of the
Section 4 Clean Up Amendment  dated 14 May 2007 as set out in item 3 of Schedule
3.16; and

         (b) any  amount (if any) which RAML and KGL agree may be payable to KGL
in respect of KGL's request for reimbursement for additional costs in respect of
the  purchase of tires and  equipment  repairs by way of letter dated August 17,
2007 as set out in item 4 of Schedule 3.16.

         In the event there is a dispute between RAML and KGL regarding any
amounts due KGL under items (a) and/or (b) above prior to the Closing Date,
SELLER covenants and agrees to cause RAML to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to resolve the dispute prior to the Closing Date. In the event that any dispute
with KGL is not resolved prior to the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount agreed to by BUYER and SELLER that is at issue in the
dispute with KGL.

                  them harmless from and against any loss, claim, liability,
                  expense or other damage attributable to: (A) all Taxes (or the
                  non-payment thereof) with respect to RAML or its business for
                  all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
                  the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any

                  RAML as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to
                  any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
                  transaction occurring before the Closing; and

                                       38

                  (ii) BUYER shall indemnify SELLER and hold SELLER harmless
         from and against any loss, claim, liability, expense or other damage
         attributable to: (A) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) with
         respect to RAML or its business for all taxable periods commencing
         after the Closing Date and that portion of any taxable period after the
         Closing Date that commenced prior to the Closing Date and continued
         after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Tax Period"), (B) all Taxes of
         any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of
         which RAML (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a
         member after the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
         Regulation ss. 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
         foreign law or regulation, and (C) any and all Taxes of any person
         (other than RAML) imposed on RAML as a transferee or successor, by
         contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate
         to an event or transaction occurring after the Closing

         (b) Straddle  Period.  In the case of any taxable  period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"),  the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of RAML or its business for the
Pre-Closing  Tax Period shall be determined  based on an interim  closing of the
books as of the close of business  on the  Closing  Date and the amount of other
Taxes  of RAML  or its  business  for a  Straddle  Period  that  relates  to the
Pre-Closing  Tax  Period  shall be deemed  to be the  amount of such Tax for the
entire  taxable  period  multiplied  by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number  of days  in the  taxable  period  ending  on the  Closing  Date  and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

         (c)  Responsibility  for Filing Tax Returns.  SELLER shall  prepare and
file,  or cause to be prepared and filed,  when due, all Tax Returns for RAML or

item of income,  loss,  credit or deduction from any period  beginning after the
Closing Date to any period including or ending on the Closing Date.

         (d) Code Section 1445 Withholding. Pursuant to Code Section 1445, BUYER

of the Real Property and shall,  within twenty (20) days after the Closing Date,
remit such amount,  together  with all  requisite  reports,  to the IRS.  SELLER

         the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
         the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6.1 and any audit,
         litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
         shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the
         provision of records and information that

                                       39

                  convenient basis to provide additional information and
                  explanation of any material provided hereunder. RAML and
                  SELLER agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect
                  to Tax matters pertinent to RAML or its business relating to
                  any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
                  expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
                  notified by BUYER or SELLER, any extensions thereof) of the
                  respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
                  retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority,
                  and (B) to give the other Party reasonable written notice
                  prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
                  and records and, if the other Party so requests, RAML or
                  SELLER, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to
                  take possession of such books and records.

                           (ii) BUYER and SELLER further agree, upon request, to
                  use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
                  document from any governmental authority or any other Person
                  as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
                  that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
                  respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

         (f)  Tax-Sharing  Agreements.  All  tax-sharing  agreements  or similar
agreements with respect to or involving RAML or its business shall be terminated
as of the  Closing  Date and,  after the Closing  Date,  RAML shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder.

         (g) Certain Taxes and Fees.  All  transfer,  documentary,  sales,  use,
stamp,  registration and other such Taxes,  and all conveyance  fees,  recording
charges  and other fees and  charges  (including  any  penalties  and  interest)
incurred in connection  with  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement  ("Transfer  Taxes")  shall be paid by BUYER when due, and BUYER
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes,  fees and charges,  and, if required by
applicable  law,  SELLER will join in the  execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

          6.2 Preservation of Records. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, BUYER and SELLER agree, at their own expense, that each (i) shall
preserve and keep their respective records (including all Tax and accounting
records) of RAML for a period of five (5) years from the Closing, or for any
longer periods as may be required by any Governmental Entity, Law, or ongoing
litigation, and (ii) shall make such records available to the other Party as may
be reasonably required by the other Party at such other Party's expense. At the
end of such five (5) year period or other applicable time period, either Party
may destroy such records without notice to the other Party.

proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in
connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity,
practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or
transaction on, prior to, or after the Closing Date involving RAML, the other
Party shall (and in the case that

                                       40
<PAGE>

the other Party is the BUYER, shall cause RAML to), cooperate with such Party or
its counsel in the defense or contest, make available their personnel, and
provide such testimony and access to their books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with the defense or contest, all at the sole

its Affiliates are entitled to indemnification therefor under this Agreement).

          6.4 SELLER's Insurance. After the Closing, under no circumstances will
BUYER be provided coverage under SELLER's or its Affiliate's insurance policies,
and no claims regarding any matter whatsoever, whether or not arising from
events prior to Closing shall be made by BUYER or its Affiliates against or with
respect to SELLER or its Affiliate's insurance policies regardless of their date
of issuance, provided that BUYER shall be entitled to maintain in effect after
Closing any insurance policies of RAML specific to RAML and not covering SELLER
or any of its other Affiliates, and RAML shall be entitled to make claims under
such policies pursuant to the policies' terms and conditions.

           6.5     Environmental Remediation; Remediation Trust.

Requirements");  (ii) the remaining  reclamation  obligations at RAML's Ambrosia
Lake Site  pursuant to the Ambrosia  Lake  closure  requirements  identified  on

reclamation obligations.

         (b) SELLER,  BUYER and RAML shall  establish a Remediation  Trust as of
the  Closing,  funded  by  BUYER,  in the form of  Exhibit  H (the  "Remediation
Trust").  The  purpose  of the  Remediation  Trust is to  serve  as a  financial
assurance that the remaining reclamation  obligations under subsection (a) above
determined as of the Closing Date are completed in a timely manner.

         6.6 RAML Employees.

         (a) Except for item #6 of Schedule  3.17(b) (BHP Billiton  Group Global
Employee Cash Plan),  following the Closing Date,  and for a one (1) year period
thereafter,  BUYER shall continue the Employee Benefit Plans of RAML that are in

         (b) Following the conclusion of the one (1) year period provided for in

on terms no less favorable than those applicable to BUYER's other employees. For
each BUYER Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any employee of RAML, BUYER shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts (not to
include any  disproportionate  increases in costs) to cause (i) each employee of
RAML,  as of the  conclusion  of the one (1) year  period  set forth in  Section
6.6(a), to be eligible, without

                                       41
<PAGE>

         any waiting period, in each such BUYER Plan to the extent that coverage
         under such BUYER Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee
         Benefit Plan for such employee, and (ii) the pre-existing condition
         exclusions of such BUYER Plan to be waived for any such employee or any
         of his or her covered dependents with a pre-existing condition to the
         extent that such pre-existing condition would have been covered for any
         such employee or his or her covered dependents under the comparable
         Employee Benefit Plan.

                  (c) BUYER shall assure that RAML is responsible for the
         continuation of health plan coverage, in accordance with the
         requirements of COBRA and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA, for any
         employee of RAML or qualified beneficiary under a group health plan
         covering employees of RAML and/or their dependents, who, prior to the

at the Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
supplement, amend or create any Schedule in order to add information or correct
previously supplied information. No such amendment shall be evidence, in and of
itself, that the representations and warranties in the corresponding section are
no longer true and correct. It is specifically agreed that such Schedules may be
amended to add immaterial, as well as material, items thereto. No such
supplemental, amended or additional Schedule shall be deemed to cure any breach
for purposes of satisfying the conditions of ARTICLE VIII. In the event that the

determined by the Parties on a reasonable basis to be between Seven Million Five
Hundred   Thousand   Dollars   (US$7,500,000)   and  Fifteen   Million   Dollars
(US$15,000,000),  (A) BUYER may terminate  this  Agreement on written  notice to
SELLER,  or (B) BUYER may  deduct  the  amount  of the  potential  Loss from the
Purchase Price; or

         (d) if the potential  Losses,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  are
determined  by the  Parties  on a  reasonable  basis to exceed  Fifteen  Million

written  notice to the other Party or (B) BUYER and SELLER may mutually agree to
deduct the amount of the potential Loss from the Purchase Price.

The Parties agree to use all reasonable endeavors and to act in good faith to
agree on a reasonable estimate of Loss arising from a notice of such Loss given

Agreement or bring an action or other claim against SELLER for any potential
Losses based upon any supplement or amendment to an existing Schedule or the
creation of a new Schedule.

         (c) there shall be no liability or obligation  hereunder on the part of
SELLER,  BUYER  or any  of  their  respective  directors,  officers,  employees,
Affiliates, agents, advisors or representatives, except that (i) if the basis of
termination is a willful,  material  breach by SELLER or BUYER,  as the case may
be, of one or more of the  provisions of this  Agreement,  the  breaching  Party
shall be liable to the  non-breaching  Party, and (ii) the obligations  provided
for in this Section 9.2 and Sections 7.1, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.7 and 11.8 hereof
and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination.

         10.1 Indemnification Obligations of SELLER. From and after Closing,

as provided in Section 10.6 (any of the foregoing, a "Loss" and collectively,

from, against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred by a SELLER

         (c) any occurrence,  event,  act or omission of RAML or any claims made
against RAML, other than an occurrence,  event,  act,  omission or claim,  which
provides the basis for a right of BUYER to indemnification under Section 10.1;

                                       47
<PAGE>

         (d)  the  termination  of  employment  of any  employee  of RAML or any

         (e) any fraud of BUYER in connection  with this  Agreement or the BUYER
Ancillary Documents.

         10.3 Indemnification for Fraud and/or Willful Misconduct.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in ARTICLE X or anywhere else
in this Agreement, each Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Party
and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by such Person after the Closing Date as a result of or
arising from any fraudulent act or willful or intentional misconduct by the
Party or its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, and Affiliates,
prior to the Closing Date.

         10.4 Indemnification Procedure.

                  (a) Procedures for Third Party Claims. Promptly after receipt
         by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third party of a threatened or
         filed complaint or the threatened or actual commencement of any audit,
         investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which such
         Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other
         Party for any Loss, such Indemnified Party shall provide a Claim Notice
         to BUYER, on the one hand, or SELLER, on the other hand, whoever is the
         appropriate indemnifying Party hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party"),
         within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party's knowledge of
         threatening or filing of such complaint or knowledge of the threatened
         or actual commencement of such audit, investigation, action or
         proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to provide a Claim
         Notice to the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party
         from liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only if,
         and only to the extent that, such failure to provide a Claim Notice to
         the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the forfeiture by the
         Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the
         Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or (ii) material
         prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
         Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered
         to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to assume
         the defense of such complaint, audit, investigation, action or
         proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory
         to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the reasonable fees and
         disbursements of such counsel. If the Indemnifying Party declines or
         fails to assume the defense of the audit, investigation, action or
         proceeding on the terms provided above within such thirty (30) day
         period, the Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend
         it in any such audit, investigation, action or proceeding and, if the
         Indemnifying Party agrees that such audit, investigation, action or
         proceeding is a matter with respect to which the Indemnified Party is
         entitled to receive payment from the Indemnifying Party for the Loss in
         question, the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and
         disbursements of such counsel as incurred; provided, however, that the
         Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and
         disbursements of more than one (1) counsel for all Indemnified Parties
         in any jurisdiction in any single audit, investigation, action or
         proceeding. In any audit, investigation, action or proceeding with
         respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the

                                       48
<PAGE>

         Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming
         the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in such
         matter and to retain its own counsel at such Party's own expense. The
         Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall
         at all times use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to keep the
         Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
         reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which
         they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other
         with respect to the defense of any such matter. No Indemnified Party
         may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any
         judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
         hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

                  (b) Procedures for Direct Claims. If an Indemnified Party
         claims a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement not involving a
         third party claim covered by Section 10.4(a) hereof, such Indemnified
         Party shall send a Claim Notice to the appropriate Indemnifying Party.

         10.5 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement, any schedule or any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect


         (a) in the case of the  representations  and  warranties  of SELLER and
BUYER  contained  in Sections  3.1  (Organization),  3.2  (Capitalization),  3.3
(Authorization),  3.20 (Environmental,  Health & Safety Matters),  3.33 (Certain
Fees),  3.27 (Absence of Certain Business  Practices),  and 3.35 (Exemption from
Registration),  and 4.1  (Authorization),  4.4 (Certain  Fees),  4.5  (Financial
Capability), 4.9 (Investment Intent), and 4.10 (Accredited Investor;  Investment
Representations) for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, (b)
in the case of the representations and warranties of SELLER contained in Section
3.19 (Taxes) for the applicable statutory period of limitations,  and (c) in the
case of all other  representations  and  warranties of the Parties  contained in
this  Agreement,  and in any  schedule  or any  certificate  delivered  pursuant
hereto,  until eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  any  representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity may be
sought  hereunder shall survive the time at which it would  otherwise  terminate
pursuant to this  Section 10.5 if notice of the breach  thereof  shall have been
given to the Party  against  whom  such  indemnity  may be  sought  prior to the
expiration  of the  applicable  survival  period.  The  Parties'  covenants  and
agreements under this Agreement shall survive the Closing  indefinitely unless a
shorter  period of  performance  is specified  with respect to such  covenant or
agreement.

         10.6 Liability Limits.  Subject to Sections 6.1(a), 10.3 and 10.9 only,
the Indemnification Obligations hereunder shall be limited as follows:

                  (a) no Losses shall be payable under Section 10.1 unless and
         until, after taking into account the other limitations of this Section
         10.6, the applicable Indemnified Party or Parties shall have suffered
         indemnifiable Losses in excess of an amount equal to US$400,000.00 in
         the aggregate, in which case, the applicable Indemnified Party or
         Parties shall be entitled to recover the first dollar of all such
         Losses;

                                       49
<PAGE>

         (b) except for fraud, in no event shall the aggregate  amount of Losses
required to be paid by an  Indemnifying  Party under Section  10.1(a) or 10.2(a)
(as  applicable) to all of the applicable  Indemnified  Parties exceed an amount
equal to US$11,000,000.00;

         (c) no Losses shall be payable  under  Section 10.1 or 10.2 for which a
written notice of a claim specifying in reasonable detail the specific nature of
and specific basis of the Losses and the estimated amount of such Losses ("Claim
Notice") is not  delivered to the  Indemnifying  Party prior to, with respect to
the   particular   claim,   the  close  of   business  on  the  date  that  such
representation,   warranty,  covenant,  or  agreement  related  to  claim  would
otherwise  expire  pursuant  to Section  10.5,  and the  indemnities  granted in
Section 10.1 or 10.2 shall terminate on such date; provided,  however, that such
indemnities  shall survive with respect only to the specific  matter that is the
subject  of any Claim  Notice  delivered  in good faith in  compliance  with the
requirements  of this Section  10.6(c) prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival  period set forth in Section 10.5 until the earlier to occur of (i) the
date on which a final  nonappealable  resolution of the matter described in such
Claim Notice has been reached, or (ii) the date on which the matter described in
such Claim Notice has otherwise reached final resolution;

         (d) for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against an
Indemnifying  Party,  the amount of each claim by an Indemnified  Party shall be
deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments by an Indemnifying Party under
Section 10.1 or 10.2 (as  applicable)  shall be limited to, the amount of Losses
that remain after deducting therefrom any third party insurance proceeds and any
indemnity,  contributions  or other similar  payment  payable by any third party
with respect thereto;

         (e) the amount of  indemnity  payable  under  Section 10.1 or 10.2 with
respect to any Loss shall be reduced to the extent  appropriate  to reflect  the
relative  contribution  to such Loss,  if any,  caused by  actions  taken by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates after the Closing;

         (f) no BUYER Indemnified Party shall be permitted to recover any Losses
under  Section  10.1 for any  alleged  breach of a  representation,  warranty or
covenant by SELLER of which BUYER had  knowledge  after the  Execution  Date but
prior to the Closing  Date and,  with  respect to such  breach,  BUYER failed to
timely provide a Breach Notice to SELLER in accordance with Section 5.4; and

         (g) in any case where an Indemnified  Party recovers from third Persons
any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which SELLER or BUYER,  as the
case may be, has  indemnified it pursuant to this  Agreement,  such  Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay over to SELLER or BUYER (as the case may be) the amount
so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred
by it in  procuring  such  recovery),  but not in  excess  of the sum of (i) any
amount  previously  so paid by  SELLER  or  BUYER  (as the case may be) to or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party in respect of such matter,  and (ii) any amount
expended by SELLER or BUYER in pursuing or  defending  any claim  arising out of
such matter.

<PAGE>

         10.7 Damage Exclusions. In any claim for indemnification under this
Agreement, neither SELLER nor BUYER shall be required to indemnify any Person
for special, exemplary or consequential damages, including loss of profit or
revenue, any multiple of reduced cash flow, interference with operations, or
loss of lenders or investors of BUYER in connection with the Acquisition.

         10.8 Reasonable Steps to Mitigate. The Indemnified Party will take all
reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses, including availing itself of any
defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third Persons and
other rights at Law or equity, and will provide such evidence and documentation
of the nature and extent of the Loss as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party's reasonable steps include the
reasonable expenditure of money to mitigate or otherwise reduce or eliminate any
Loss for which indemnification would otherwise be due under this ARTICLE X, and
the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for the Indemnified
Party's reasonable expenditures in undertaking the mitigation.

         10.9 Special  Indemnity.  SELLER agrees to  indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless RAML and the BUYER Indemnified  Parties from any and all Losses related
to or arising out of (i) the option to purchase up to  1,000,000  pounds of U3O8
from the Smith  Ranch  Project,  which  option was  granted to  Solution  Mining
Corporation  pursuant  to an  Agreement  dated  June  23,  1993,  and  (ii)  the
requirement  to deliver  649,691  pounds of U3O8  pursuant to Uranium  Inventory
Purchase  Agreement  dated June 18, 2002 between RAML and Cameco Europe S.A. The
special indemnity  provided for in this Section 10.9 shall not be subject to any
of the liability limits set forth in Section 10.6.

         10.10 Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing Date. Following the
Closing Date, the provisions of this ARTICLE X and Section 11.8 hereof set forth
the exclusive rights and remedies of BUYER and SELLER to seek or obtain damages
or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any Party with respect to matters
arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the Acquisition from and
after the Closing Date.

         10.11 Environmental Remedies. Without limiting the generality of
Section 10.10, BUYER understands and agrees that its right to indemnification
under Section 10.1 for breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.20 shall constitute its sole and exclusive remedy against SELLER and
its Affiliates with respect to any environmental, health, or safety matter
relating to the past, current or future facilities, properties or operations,
acts or omissions of RAML, including without limitation any such matter arising
under any Environmental, Health & Safety Laws and any Environmental Liabilities.
Further, the BUYER Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
to the extent that BUYER's or RAML's actions or omissions following the Closing
Date cause, contribute to, continue or exacerbate (i) any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.20 or (ii) any
Environmental Liability.

         11.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (including by
facsimile) to the other Party.

         11.10 Amendment;  Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented at any time by written agreement of the Parties.

         11.11 Disclosure Schedules. Certain agreements and other matters are
listed in the Schedules and Exhibits for informational purposes only,
notwithstanding the fact that, because they do not rise above applicable
materiality thresholds or otherwise, they are not required to be listed herein
by the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the listing of such agreements
or other matters in the Schedules or Exhibits be deemed or interpreted to
broaden or otherwise amplify SELLER's representations and warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document. The
headings contained in the Schedules and Exhibits are for convenience of
reference only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence the interpretation
of the information contained in the Schedules, the Exhibits or the Agreement.
Furthermore, the disclosure of a particular item of information in the Schedules
or Exhibits shall not be taken as an admission by SELLER that such disclosure is
required to be made under the terms of any of such representations and
warranties. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule or Exhibit hereto
referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement if such
disclosure would permit a reasonable person to find such disclosure relevant to
such other sections. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedules or Exhibits hereto is not intended to imply
that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting
of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy
as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein or included
in a Schedule or Exhibit is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
