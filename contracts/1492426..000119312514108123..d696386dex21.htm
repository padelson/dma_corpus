Entry Shares in exchange for Vidara Ordinary Shares. Upon surrender of Buyer
Certificates or Buyer Book Entry Shares (as applicable) for cancellation to

Shares (as applicable) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the Person requesting such transfer shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of Vidara Ordinary
Shares to a Person other than the registered holder of such Buyer Certificate
or Buyer Book Entry Shares (as applicable) or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.9(b)_, each Buyer Certificate
or Buyer Book Entry Shares (as applicable) shall be deemed at any time after

Consideration upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any amount payable pursuant to  _Section 2.9(a)_.

surrender of any such Buyer Certificate or Buyer Book Entry Shares (as
applicable), there shall be transferred or paid to the record holder thereof
by the Exchange Agent, without interest promptly after such surrender, the
number of Vidara Ordinary Shares transferrable in exchange therefor pursuant

reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article

Entry Shares (as applicable) as of the one year anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Vidara or its designee, upon demand, and the
Vidara Ordinary Shares included therein shall be sold at the best price
reasonably obtainable at that time. Any holder of Buyer Certificates or Buyer
Book Entry Shares (as applicable) who has not complied with this  _Article
II_ prior to the one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter
look only to Vidara for payment of such holders claim for the Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
applicable Laws).

(f) _No Liability_. None of Vidara, Merger Sub, Buyer, Holdings any Vidara
Company or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers,

Ordinary Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Vidara and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person who was a holder of Buyer Common Stock or Vidara Ordinary Shares

such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law. If Vidara determines that it or its Subsidiary is required

provide a reasonable opportunity for the recipient of the payment to provide
forms or other evidence that would mitigate, reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. Holdings, Vidara and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that all Taxes are properly deducted and withheld
and to mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Vidara or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have
been paid.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Buyer
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders
compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Exchange
Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Buyer Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Buyer Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration as may be required in respect of the shares of Buyer
Common Stock represented by the Buyer Certificate pursuant to _Section
2.7(a)_.

2.10 _Buyer Stock Based Awards and Equity Plans_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Buyer Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the
Effective Time into an option to acquire, on substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Buyer Option, the number of Vidara
Ordinary Shares equal to the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to
such Buyer Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, at an exercise
price per Vidara Ordinary Share equal to the exercise price per share of Buyer
Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Buyer Option.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Buyer Share Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the
Effective Time into a share award to acquire, on substantially the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Buyer Share Award, the number of
Vidara Ordinary Shares equal to the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock subject to such Buyer Share Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) The adjustments provided in this _Section 2.10_ with respect to any
Buyer Options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of
the Code) are intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with
Section 424(a) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise price
of, and the number of shares subject to, each Buyer Option adjusted pursuant
to _Section 2.10_ shall be determined in a manner necessary to comply with
Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

(d) As of the Effective Time, Vidara will assume the Buyer Share Plans.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of each Buyer

Time, unless otherwise elected by the holder of any such Buyer Warrant, Vidara
shall assume all obligations under such Buyer

 



-25-  Warrant and shall issue a replacement warrant to acquire, on substantially
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Buyer Warrant, the
number of Vidara Ordinary Shares equal to the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock subject to such Buyer Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time, at an exercise price per Vidara Ordinary Share equal to the exercise
price per share of Buyer Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Buyer Warrant; _provided_ , that each of the Buyer Warrants set forth on
Section 2.10(e) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall terminate on and as of
the Closing unless previously exercised in accordance with their terms. 

(f) The implementation of the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.10_
shall be subject to any adjustments to the Buyer Options, the Buyer Share
Awards, the Buyer Share Plans and the Buyer Warrants that may be required by
Irish law by virtue of the fact that Vidara will be an Irish public limited
company following the Effective Time.

 

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering Buyers stock-based incentive plans)
and Vidara shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be
reasonably required to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this  _Section
2.10_.



   2.11 | _Post-Closing Adjustment_. 
---|--- 

(a) Subsequent to the Closing and subject to  _Section 2.11(f)_, the
Estimated Cash Consideration shall be:

(i) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Cash exceeds the
Estimated Cash or _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Estimated
Cash exceeds the Final Cash;

 

(ii) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Working Capital
exceeds the Estimated Working Capital or  _decreased_ by the amount (if any)
by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Final Working Capital;

(iii)  _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Closing
Interest Bearing Indebtedness exceeds the Final Closing Interest Bearing
Indebtedness or _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Interest
Bearing Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Closing Interest Bearing
Indebtedness; and

(iv) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Holdings
Transaction Expenses exceeds the Final Holdings Transaction Expenses or
_decreased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Holdings Transaction
Expenses exceeds the Estimated Holdings Transaction Expenses.

The Estimated Cash Consideration, as so increased or decreased in accordance
with this _Section 2.11(a)_, shall be the " _Final Cash Consideration_ "
hereunder.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than one hundred and
twenty (120) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) prepare a
statement of the calculation

 



-26-  of Closing Cash, Working Capital, Closing Interest Bearing Indebtedness and
Holdings Transaction Expenses together with a calculation of the estimated
Final Cash Consideration (the " _Closing Date Statement_ "), and (ii) deliver
the Closing Date Statement to Holdings. The calculations of Closing Cash,
Working Capital, Closing Interest Bearing Indebtedness and Holdings
Transaction Expenses for the purposes of the Closing Date Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement.

(c) Buyer shall permit Holdings and its representatives reasonable access to
books and records, personnel, and facilities of the Vidara Companies during
normal working hours to permit Holdings to review the Closing Date Statement;
_provided_ , that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
business operations of the Vidara Companies and that the Persons provided such
access shall treat any confidential or proprietary information of the Vidara
Companies received in connection therewith as confidential and shall not
disclose such information to any third party. Subject to the restrictions in
the preceding sentence, Holdings shall have the right to review the work
papers of Buyer underlying or utilized in preparing the Closing
Date Statement and the calculation of the estimated Final Cash Consideration
to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy and fairness of the
presentation of the Closing Date Statement and calculation of the Final Cash
Consideration in conformity with this Agreement.

(d) Within thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Holdings shall either inform Buyer in writing that the Closing
Date Statement is acceptable or object thereto in writing, setting forth a
specific description of each of its objections. If Holdings so objects and the
Parties do not resolve such objections on a mutually agreeable basis within
thirty (30) calendar days after Buyers receipt of Holdings objections, the
remaining disputed items shall be resolved within an additional thirty (30)
calendar days by Ernst and Young LLP or another mutually agreed accounting firm
(the " _Referral Firm_ "). Holdings shall make available to Buyer (upon
request following the giving of any objection to the Closing Date Statement)
the workpapers of Holdings generated in connection with its review of the
Closing Date Statement. Upon the written agreement of the Parties, the
decision of the Referral Firm, or if Holdings fails to deliver an objection to
Buyer within the first 30-day period referred to above, the Closing Date
Statement, as so adjusted (the " _Final Closing Date Statement_ "), shall be
final, conclusive and binding against the Parties. The statements of Closing
Cash, Working Capital, Closing Interest Bearing Indebtedness and Holdings
Transaction Expenses set forth in the Final Closing Statement shall be the "
_Final Cash_ ", " _Final Working Capital_ ", " _Final Closing Interest Bearing
Indebtedness_ " and " _Final Holdings  Transaction Expenses_" for all
purposes hereunder.

(e) In resolving any disputed item, the Referral Firm (i) shall be bound by
the provisions of this _Section 2.11_, (ii) may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Holdings, (iii) shall
limit its decision to such items as are in dispute and (iv) shall make its
determination based solely on presentations by Buyer and Holdings which are in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement
(i.e., not on the basis of independent review). The fees and expenses of the
Referral Firm shall be allocated between Buyer and Holdings in such a way that
(x) Buyer shall be responsible for that portion of the fees and
expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate
dollar value of disputed items submitted to the Referral Firm that are
resolved against Buyer (as finally

 



-27-  determined by the Referral Firm) and the denominator of which is the total
dollar value of the disputed items so submitted and (y) Holdings shall be
responsible for the remaining amount of fees and expenses, which amount shall
be paid out of the Temporary Escrow Amount. In the event of any dispute
regarding such allocation, the Referral Firm shall determine the allocation of
its fees and expenses as between Buyer and Holdings in accordance with such
allocation methodology, such determination to be final and binding on both
Buyer and Holdings.

(f) Promptly after their receipt of the Final Closing Date Statement,
Holdings and Buyer shall compute the difference, if any, between the Estimated
Cash Consideration and the Final Cash Consideration. If the Estimated Cash
Consideration exceeds the Final Cash Consideration, then Buyer shall be
entitled to receive, promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days,
from the escrow account established under the Temporary Escrow Agreement an
amount in cash equal to such excess amount, plus interest at the rate of five
percent (5%) per annum from the Closing Date to the date of payment. BUYER
AGREES THAT ITS SOLE SOURCE OF RECOVERY UNDER THIS _SECTION 2.11_ SHALL BE
LIMITED TO, AND SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE, THE TEMPORARY ESCROW
AMOUNT. If the Estimated Cash Consideration is less than the Final Cash
Consideration, Holdings shall be entitled to receive, promptly and in any
event within five (5) Business Days, from Buyer an amount in cash equal to
such deficiency, plus interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum
from the Closing Date to the date of payment; _provided_ , that Buyers
payment obligation under this _Section 2.11_ shall be limited to, and in no
event shall it exceed in the aggregate, the Temporary Escrow Amount (which
maximum amount, for clarity, would be payable in addition to the release of
the full amount of the funds contained in the escrow account established under
the Temporary Escrow Agreement to Holdings). Following payment of the amounts
described above, Buyer and Holdings shall cause the Escrow Agent to release
the balance, if any, of the escrow account established under the Temporary
Escrow Agreement to Holdings in accordance with the terms of the Temporary
Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOLDINGS

 

Holdings hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date of this

and operate its respective assets and properties as they are now being owned
and operated. Each of the Vidara Companies is qualified or licensed to do
business and, to the extent applicable, is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or, where relevant, in good standing, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Vidara Material Adverse
Effect. Section 3.1 of the Vidara Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name of
each Vidara Company, the jurisdiction of its organization, the authorized and
outstanding equity interests of such Vidara Company and the Persons owning

 



-28-  such outstanding equity interests of such Vidara Company. Except as set
forth in Section 3.1 of the Vidara Disclosure Schedule, none of the Vidara
Companies owns any equity interest in any Person. Holdings has heretofore
made available to the Buyer complete and correct copies of the Organizational

(a) The entire authorized capital stock of Vidara consists of 100 ordinary
shares. As of the date of this Agreement, of such authorized shares, 100 are
issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of Vidaras capital
stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No
shares of Vidara were issued in violation of the preemptive rights of
any shareholder.

(b) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
preemptive rights, deferred compensation rights, equity appreciation rights,
"phantom" stock rights, calls, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
similar rights, agreements or commitments relating to the issuance of capital
stock or other equity securities to which Holdings or any Vidara Company is a

of capital stock or other equity interests of any Vidara Company or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests (in each
case other than to a Vidara Company); (ii) grant, extend or enter into any
such subscription, option, warrant, put, call, exchangeable or convertible
securities or other similar right, agreement or commitment; or (iii) redeem

understandings with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity

Members). Each of Holdings and Vidara has duly and validly executed and
delivered this Agreement and has duly and validly executed and delivered (or
prior to or at the Closing will duly and validly execute and deliver) its
Related Agreements. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Holdings and Vidara and Holdings and Vidaras Related
Agreements, upon execution and delivery by Holdings and Vidara, will
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Holdings and Vidara, in
each case, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect
which affect the enforcement of creditors 

 



-29-  rights generally and by equitable principles. No "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or
regulation enacted under any federal, state, local or foreign Laws applicable
to Holdings or any of the Vidara Companies is applicable to the Merger or the
other Transactions.

assets of any Vidara Company, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation or
breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents of Holdings or any
Vidara Company or (iii) conflict with or violate any material Laws applicable

(b) Other than (i) as may be required pursuant to or in connection with the
Companies Act, HSR Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and (ii) as set
forth in Section 3.4(b) of the Vidara Disclosure Schedule, no consent,

complete copies the Financial Statements. The Financial Statements set forth
in Section 3.5 of the Vidara Disclosure Schedule have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (except as set forth in the

disclosed in Section 3.5(b) of the Vidara Disclosure Schedule, (ii)
Liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the

other employees of any Vidara Company who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the
Vidara Companies or (z) any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing.

 

(d) Neither Holdings nor any Vidara Company is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or
any similar contract (including any contract relating to any transaction,
arrangement or relationship between or among Holdings or any Vidara Company,
on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving Holdings or any Vidara
Company in the consolidated financial statements of Holdings and the Vidara
Companies. No Vidara Company has guaranteed or is otherwise responsible for
any obligation of any other Person.

 

(e) Holdings has made available to Buyer an aging schedule with respect to the

title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, each of its material assets
reflected in the Financial Statements or used in the Business, free and clear
of any Lien, except for Permitted Liens. The assets and properties (whether
real or personal, tangible or intangible) owned or leased by the Vidara
Companies

 



-31-  constitute all of the assets and properties necessary to operate the
Business or otherwise used by any of the Vidara Companies during the past

Property except as provided in the Vidara Material Contracts.

 

(f) All patents, patent applications and trademark, trade name or service mark
registrations and applications within the Vidara Registered Intellectual
Property have been properly assigned to a Vidara Company, and all such
assignments have been properly recorded in the applicable office in which such
registrations or applications have been filed, to the extent the applicable
office permits such recording.

(g) The Vidara Companies have prosecuted in accordance with applicable Laws,
and have timely made all filings and paid all fees required to be paid or

within the Vidara Registered Intellectual Property on a commercially
reasonable basis.

or in part, any Vidara Intellectual Property that was developed by any of the
Vidara Companies or any of their employees since December 20, 2011. To
the Knowledge of Vidara, no funding, facilities, or personnel of any
Governmental Authority or any public or private university, college, or other
educational or research institution were used, directly or indirectly, to
develop or create, in whole or in part, any Vidara Intellectual Property
owned by the Vidara Companies that was acquired from any third party.

(j) Except as set forth in Section 3.7(j) of the Vidara Disclosure Schedule,
there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Vidara, threatened Actions by any
Person alleging infringement or misappropriation by any Vidara Company of any
Intellectual Property of any other Person, nor has any Vidara Company
received written communication from any Person threatening the institution of
any such Action. To the Knowledge of Vidara, the conduct of the

Vidara Company is subject to any writ, judgment, injunction, order, decree,
stipulation determination or award entered by or with any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Vidara Companies practice of any of the Vidara
Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Vidara, no Person has infringed,
misappropriated or engaged in any unauthorized use, or is currently

Vidara Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to the
Vidara Companies.

(k) Each Vidara Company and Holdings has taken commercially reasonable
precautions to maintain the confidentiality of all trade secrets and know how

(B) executed appropriate instruments assigning, or agreements to assign, to
such Vidara Company the sole and exclusive ownership of all Intellectual
Property conceived by such Person during the course of such Persons

Company or Holdings is in violation of any term of any assignment of the
Vidara Registered Intellectual Property or other agreement regarding the
protection of Vidara Intellectual Property.

(l) Neither the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will,
with or without notice or lapse of time, result in, or give any other Person

Intellectual Property; (b) a breach of or default under any Contract
disclosed in Section 3.8(i) of the Vidara Disclosure Schedule; (c) the
release, disclosure or delivery of any Vidara Intellectual Property by or to
any escrow agent or other Person; or (d) the grant, assignment, or transfer

5.7 _Buyer Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.6_, if Buyer
receives a bona fide unsolicited written Buyer Alternative Proposal or
inquiry or proposal from a Person who Buyer reasonably believes is intending
to make a Buyer Alternative Proposal and the Buyer Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with Buyers financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions described in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this _Section 5.7_ would reasonably constitute a breach of the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and which Buyer
Alternative Proposal, inquiry or proposal was made after the date of this
Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of _Section 5.6_ or this
_Section 5.7_, Buyer may take any or all of the following actions:

 

(i) furnish non-public information to the third party (and any persons acting
in concert with such third party and to their respective potential financing
sources and Representatives) making or intending to make such Buyer
Alternative Proposal (provided that all such information has previously been
provided to Holdings or is provided to Holdings prior to or concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person(s)), if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, Buyer receives from the third party and persons
acting in concert with the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms that permit disclosures by Buyer and its Representatives as required
by _Section 5.6_ and this _Section 5.7_ and that are otherwise not less
restrictive of such person in the aggregate than those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement; or

 



-68- (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party making
or intending to make such Buyer Alternative Proposal with respect to such
Buyer Alternative Proposal,

_provided_ , that prior to taking any action described in clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Buyer Board shall have determined in good faith, based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Buyer Alternative Proposal either
constitutes a Buyer Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Buyer Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Section 5.7, prior to making the determination required
by the foregoing sentence that such Buyer Alternative Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Buyer Superior Proposal the Buyer
and its Representatives may contact the Person making such Buyer Alternative
Proposal solely to clarify the material terms and conditions of such Buyer
Alternative Proposal.

(b) Buyer will promptly (and in any event within 36 hours of receipt) notify
Holdings orally and in writing of the receipt of any Buyer Alternative
Proposal or any communication or proposal that could reasonably be expected to
lead to any Buyer Alternative Proposal and shall, in the case of any such
notice to Holdings as to receipt of a Buyer Alternative Proposal, indicate
the material terms and conditions of such Buyer Alternative Proposal or such
communication or proposal (including any changes to such material terms and
conditions) and the identity of the person making any such Buyer Alternative
Proposal and thereafter shall promptly keep Holdings reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of any material change to the terms and status of any
such Buyer Alternative Proposal. Buyer shall provide to Holdings as soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event
within 36 hours of receipt or delivery) copies of all written correspondence
and other written material exchanged between Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
and the person making a Buyer Alternative Proposal (or such persons
Representatives) that describes any of the material terms or conditions of
such Buyer Alternative Proposal, including draft agreements or term sheets
submitted by either party in connection therewith. Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with
any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits Buyer from
providing such information to Holdings or complying with its obligations to
Holdings under the Agreement.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.7(d)_ below, neither the Buyer Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold or withdraw (or qualify or
modify in any manner adverse to Holdings), or propose publicly to withhold or
withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Holdings), the Buyer
Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend, adopt, or otherwise declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend, adopt or otherwise
declare advisable, any Buyer Alternative Proposal (any of the foregoing
actions in this sub-clause (i) being a " _Buyer Change of Recommendation_ ")
(it being agreed that (x) no "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act in and of itself shall constitute a Buyer
Change of Recommendation and (y) for the avoidance of doubt, the provision by
Buyer to Holdings of notice or information in connection with a Buyer
Alternative Proposal or Buyer Superior Proposal as required or expressly
permitted by this Agreement shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Buyer
Change of Recommendation) or (ii) cause or allow Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, 

 



-69-  agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, transaction
agreement, implementation agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement, license agreement or
other agreement constituting or with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Buyer Alternative Proposal.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Buyer Board at
any time prior to obtaining the Buyer Stockholder Approval, from making a
Buyer Change of Recommendation in connection with a Buyer Alternative Proposal
if the Buyer Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
Buyers outside legal counsel and financial advisors) (i) that such
Buyer Alternative Proposal constitutes a Buyer Superior Proposal and (ii)
that the failure to make a Buyer Change of Recommendation would reasonably
constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer shall have provided prior written notice
to Holdings, at least three Business Days in advance, of the Buyer Boards
making such Buyer Change of Recommendation, and specifying the material terms
of the Buyer Alternative Proposal, the identity of the person making such
Buyer Alternative Proposal and such other information with respect to such
Buyer Alternative Proposal required by _Section 5.7(b)_, and provided,
further, that the Buyer Board shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement or the Transactions proposed by Holdings during such
three Business Day period in response to such prior written notice or
otherwise, and during such three Business Day period Buyer shall engage in
good faith negotiations with Holdings regarding any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Holdings.

(e) Other than in connection with a Buyer Alternative Proposal, prior to the
Closing Date, the Buyer Board may make a Buyer Change of Recommendation in
response to a Change in Circumstance only after the fifth (5th) Business Day
following Holdings receipt of written notice (which notice shall not
constitute a Buyer Change of Recommendation) from the Buyer setting forth a
description of such Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail and stating
that the Buyer Board has determined that the failure to make a Buyer Change of
Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the Buyer Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and only if, during such five (5)
Business Day period, the Buyer and its Representatives shall have negotiated
in good faith with Holdings and its Representatives to amend this Agreement so
that such Change in Circumstance would no longer necessitate a Buyer Change
of Recommendation and, at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, after
taking into account any changes to the terms and provisions of this Agreement
proposed by Holdings as a result of such negotiations, the Buyer Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make the Buyer Change of Recommendation would reasonably
constitute a breach of the Buyer Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

 

(f) (i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.7_ will prohibit Buyer from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or under applicable
Law and (ii) no disclosure that the Buyer Board may determine (after
consultation with outside counsel) that it or the Buyer, as applicable, is
required to make under applicable Law will constitute a violation of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that in any event the Buyer Board shall not make a
Buyer Change Recommendation except in accordance with this  _Section 5.7_.
Any general public disclosure by the Buyer of a Buyer Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Buyer Change Recommendation, unless the Buyer Board
reaffirms its recommendation and declaration of advisability with respect to
this Agreement in such disclosure.

 



-70- 5.8 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of Holdings and Vidara shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i)
cause all the closing conditions contained in _Article VI_ to be satisfied,
including by obtaining and delivering the necessary agreements and documents

to be obtained or provided by any of the Vidara Companies pursuant to any
applicable Law, Contract or otherwise in connection with the Reorganization or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause all the closing
conditions contained in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, including by obtaining
and delivering the necessary agreements and documents pursuant thereto, and
(ii) obtain each consent and provide any notice required to be obtained or
provided by it pursuant to any applicable Law, Contract or otherwise in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, (i) Buyer shall promptly notify Holdings in writing
of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ impossible or unlikely or that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have or result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect and (ii)
Holdings shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of any event, condition, fact
or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to make the timely
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ impossible or
unlikely or that has had or could reasonably be expected to have or result in
a Vidara Material Adverse Effect. No notification given pursuant to this
_Section 5.8(c)_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations of the Parties contained in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement.

 

5.9 _Competition Clearance_.

 

(a) Without limiting _Section 5.8_, each of Buyer and Holdings agrees to make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof
and to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional
information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all
other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable and to obtain all requisite authorizations and approvals under
other Antitrust Laws.

(b) Each of Holdings, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall,
in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.9(a) to obtain all
requisite clearances, approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation

 



-71-  or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party,
(ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed of any communication received by
such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the
" _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_
") or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other Party to review any communication given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the
extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, foreign antitrust or competition related Laws and all other federal,
state and local statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or acquisition.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in _Sections 5.9(a)_ and _(b)_ , if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law
or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private
party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of Holdings and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all such actions as may be necessary to resolve objections
or suits so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner, including (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, regardless of the consideration, the sale, divestiture,
license or disposition of any assets or businesses of Holdings or the
Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates or of Buyer or controlled Affiliates,
and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the
Closing Date would limit Buyers, Holdings or the Subsidiaries or their
controlled Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, one or more of its businesses, product lines or assets, in each case
as may be required in order to effect the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ and _Article VII_ prior to the Termination Date and to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other legal requirement in any suit or proceeding that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the
Closing beyond the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to become subject
to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
order, requirement, condition, understanding or agreement of or with a
Governmental Authority to sell, to license, to hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the
assets or business of Holdings or any of its Affiliates, unless such order,

in the event that the Closing occurs.

 

(d) Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under the
HSR Act.

 



-72- 5.10 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access_. For a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing Date or such other period (if longer) required by
applicable Law, (a) Vidara shall preserve and retain, all corporate,
accounting, legal, auditing, human resources, Tax and other books and records
of the Vidara Companies (including any documents relating to any governmental
or non-governmental claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations)
relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the Vidara Companies
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Vidara Books and Records_ "), in each case,
in accordance with the document and record retention policies of Buyer in
effect as of the Closing, and (b) Buyer and Vidara shall afford to Holdings
and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Vidara Books and Records to the extent, and for a purpose, reasonably
requested by Holdings, but excluding where such Vidara Books and Records are

respect to outstanding litigation), or (ii) attorney-client privilege or other
privilege which would be impaired by such disclosure; _provided_ , that the
Persons provided such access shall treat any non-public information of the
Vidara Companies as confidential and shall not disclose such information to
any third party.

5.11 _Employees and Benefits_.

(a) For a period of no less than one (1) year following the Closing Date, and
other than with the consent of such Vidara Employee, Vidara shall provide or
cause each of the individuals employed by the Vidara Companies immediately
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Vidara Employees_ ") to be provided with,
but only to the extent such Vidara Employee remains employed by a Vidara
Company or the Buyer during the applicable period (i) an annual base salary
(or annual base pay) that is no less favorable to such Vidara Employee than

comparable, in the aggregate, as selected in the Buyers sole discretion to
either (A) to those generally made available to similarly situated

Vidara Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Vidara Benefit
Plans.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.11_ shall not limit the
obligation of Vidara or its Affiliates to comply with applicable Laws or to
maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an
existing contract (if any), must be maintained for a period longer than one
(1) year following the Closing Date. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any Vidara Employee and
this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Vidara or the
Surviving Corporation from having the right to terminate the employment of any
Vidara Employee; _provided_ that any such termination is effected in
accordance with applicable Law.

(c) To the extent that a Vidara Employee continues in employment and
participates in a benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that such Vidara Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Vidara Companies and their Affiliates, and any
predecessor entities thereof, before the Closing Date, under any benefit plan
of the Surviving

 



-73-  Corporation (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings,
medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave
entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance, termination
indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) to the same extent as such
Vidara Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such
service under such Vidara Benefit Plan for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility
and early retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual, if applicable,
except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits
for the same period of service. With respect to the calendar year in which
Vidara or any of its Affiliates ceases to maintain any particular Vidara
Benefit Plan (or to the extent a Vidara Employee ceases to participate in a
Vidara Benefit Plan in connection with or following the Closing Date) and the
Vidara Employee commences participation in a parallel benefit plan of the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that each Vidara Employee shall be given credit
for amounts previously paid under such Vidara Benefit Plan for the applicable
plan year for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums (including any lifetime maximums) as though such amounts had been
paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan,
program or arrangement of the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.

(d) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive for each Vidara
Employee and his or her dependents any waiting period provision, payment
requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation,
actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation under the welfare plans applicable to such
Vidara Employee after the Closing Date to the extent such waiting period, pre-
existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other
restriction would not have been applicable to such Vidara Employee under the
terms of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of Vidara or its Affiliate,
as applicable.

 

(e) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no provision of this
Agreement shall limit the right of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to amend
or terminate any Buyer Benefit Plan or the right to amend or terminate any
Vidara Benefit Plan at any time following the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Vidara Service Providers shall be deemed to be a third
party beneficiary of this _Section 5.11_.

(f) Unless otherwise requested by Buyer in writing at least five days prior to
the Effective Time, each of Holdings and Vidara agrees to take (or cause to
be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to withdraw as a participating
employer in the Oasis Retirement Savings Plan, with such withdrawal effective
as of the date immediately prior to the Effective Time and conditioned upon
the Effective Time, and, prior to and conditioned upon such withdrawal as a
participating employer, fully vest any and all unvested amounts of the
accounts of all U.S. Vidara Employees who are participants at the time of
such withdrawal. In the event of such withdrawal from the Oasis Retirement
Savings Plan, from and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall provide to
Continuing Employees benefits under the Buyer 401(k) Plan (the " _Buyer
401(k) Plan_ "). The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow
the Vidara Employees to make eligible rollover contributions to the Buyer
401(k) Plan of their account balances (in cash and in loan notes, if any,
evidencing loans to such Vidara Employees as of the date of distribution)
from the Oasis Retirement Savings Plan as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time.

 



-74- (g) Unless otherwise requested by Buyer in writing at least five days prior to
the Effective Time, each of Holdings and Vidara agrees to take (or cause to
be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate its Service
Agreement with Oasis and the participation of all Vidara U.S. Employees in the
Oasis Benefit Plans, each effective as of the Effective Time.

5.12 _Public Announcements_. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the SEC or any Governmental Authority,
the Parties shall consult together as to the terms of, the timing of and the
manner of publication of any formal public announcement which any Party may
make primarily regarding the Merger or this Agreement. Buyer and Holdings
shall give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any
such public announcement and shall not issue any such public announcement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the SEC or any Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.12_ to the contrary, (a) each
Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement
in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences and make internal announcements to employees,
so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or
individually, if approved by the other Party), (b) a Party may, without the
prior consent of any other Party, issue any such press release or make any
such public announcement or statement as may be required by Law or the rules
and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the NASDAQ Global
Market if it first notifies and consults with the other Party prior to issuing
any such press release or making any such public announcement or statement;
and (c) Buyer need not consult with the Holdings or Vidara in connection with
any press release, public statement or filing to be issued or made in
accordance with _Sections 5.6_ and _5.7_ with respect to any
Buyer Alternative Proposal or any Buyer Change Recommendation.

5.13 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For at least six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Vidara agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of
the Vidara Companies (each a " _D andO Indemnitee_" and, collectively, the " _D
andO Indemnitees_") to the same extent such persons are currently indemnified by
the Vidara Companies pursuant to their Organizational Documents for acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, and Vidara shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Vidara Companies or their successors Organizational
Documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of former officers
and directors as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer may (at its sole and absolute
discretion) purchase a directors and officers liability insurance "tail
policy" with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time, and on
terms and conditions no less favorable to the DandO Indemnitees than those in
effect under the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Vidara Companies as of the Closing Date (the
"Existing DandO Policy"). If such "tail policy" is not obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer shall cause to be obtained and maintained in effect,
for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, policies of directors and
officers liability insurance protecting the DandO Indemnitees with coverage and
containing terms and conditions (including with respect to deductible, amount
and payment of

 



-75-  attorneys fees) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those of
the Existing DandO Policy; _provided_ _,_ that (i) Buyer may substitute for the
Existing DandO Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage and (ii)
Buyer shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy
(or for any substitute policies) in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid
by the Vidara Companies for the Existing DandO Policy (the " _Maximum Premium_
"). In the event any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or
any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium, Buyer shall be entitled
to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any
substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a
premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 5.13_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely.
In the event that Vidara or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, the successors and assigns of Vidara or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall expressly assume and be bound by the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.13_.

 

(d) The obligations of Vidara and its Subsidiaries under this _Section 5.13_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.13_ applies without the consent of
such affected DandO Indemnitee.

 

5.14 _Filing of Tax Returns; Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Holdings shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed in a
timely manner, all Tax Returns required to be filed by any Vidara Company
after the date hereof and before the Closing Date with respect to any Tax.
Buyer and Vidara shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed in a
timely manner, all Tax Returns required to be filed by Vidara or any of
its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared, and any
positions and elections relating thereto made, in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of Holdings and the Vidara Companies unless otherwise required
by applicable Law. Prior to the filing of any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period, (i) Buyer agrees to deliver such Tax Return to
Holdings at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof, (ii)
discuss in good faith with Holdings the items reflected on the Tax Return, and
(iii) make any adjustments requested by Holdings unless, after a reasonable
good faith determination, the Buyer determines that (A) there is insufficient
authority to conclude that such comment or change is more likely than not
correct in the terms of U.S. Treasury Regulations §1.6694-2(b), or (B) such
comment or proposed change would reasonably be expected to
materially increase the amount of any Taxes due by the Post Transaction Group
in a taxable year after the Straddle Period. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, Vidara shall not, without the prior written consent of
Holdings (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), file
any amended Tax Return with respect to any Vidara Company for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Buyer and Vidara hereby covenant and agree that neither Vidara nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall, unless required by applicable Law with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, retroactively apply any changes, amendments or
alterations in the Tax positions or elections taken by Holdings or any Vidara
Company in any manner that would result in a breach of any of Holdings
representations or warranties contained

 



-76-  herein or would otherwise give rise to any obligation of Holdings. Buyer
shall cooperate in providing Holdings with sufficient information to
determining the earnings and profits amount and the amount includable under
Code section 1248, and all information pertaining to the accurate
determination of the Subpart F income with respect to each of the Vidara
Companies for any Straddle Period.

 

(b) Each Party hereby acknowledges that it is its intent for all Tax purposes
to treat the Merger as a taxable acquisition of Buyer, and the Parties agree
to file their Tax Returns accordingly, except to the extent otherwise required
by a final determination by any Taxing authority.

 

(c) From the Closing Date through December 31, 2014, Buyer shall not allow any
Legacy Vidara Company to: (i) acquire or in-license any intangible property
rights or products that may result in the accrual of any earnings and profits
by a Legacy Vidara Company in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014; (ii)
raise the price of any Product; (iii) license or sell any intangible property
to any party that may result in the accrual of any earnings and profits by a
Legacy Vidara Company in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014, or (iv)
enter into any other transaction or engage in any other business outside such
companys Ordinary Course of Business (provided however that solely for
purposes of this _Section 5.14(c)_, "Ordinary Course of Business" shall
include collaboration agreements and research and development Agreements)
that would increase the earnings and profits or Subpart F income of a Legacy
Vidara Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes; in each case, to the
extent any such action could reasonably be expected to result in a
U.S. federal income tax liability to any Holdings Member in excess of the
U.S. federal income tax liability (determined without regard to any unrelated
tax attribute of such Holdings Member) such Holdings Member would have
otherwise incurred based on an interim closing of the books of the Legacy
Vidara Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date (provided
that reductions or deductions to earnings and profits or Subpart F income that
are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period beginning immediately after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period).

 

(d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
by Buyer.

 

5.15 _Preparation of SEC Documents_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
Vidara shall cooperate and prepare, and Buyer shall file with the SEC, a
preliminary form of the proxy statement to be sent to the Buyer stockholders
in connection with the Buyer Stockholder Meeting (the "Buyer Proxy
Statement"), and Vidara and Buyer shall cooperate and prepare, and Vidara
(in cooperation with Buyer) shall file the Registration Statement with the
SEC. Buyer will cause the Buyer Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable

 



-77-  provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Vidara and Buyer will cause the Registration Statement to comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Registration Statement and the
Buyer Proxy Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by
each of Buyer and Vidara to be included therein. Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Buyer Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC
as promptly as practicable after filing. Buyer will advise Vidara, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of
the Buyer Proxy Statement or any SEC comments thereon. Each of Vidara and
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
filing and to remain effective as long as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Vidara will advise Buyer, promptly after
Vidara receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Registration Statement or any SEC comments thereon. Buyer and Vidara shall
take any action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of
process) in connection with the issuance of Vidara Ordinary Shares in the
Merger.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the initial filing of the Registration
Statement with the SEC, each of Vidara and Buyer shall cooperate and prepare
and file with the SEC the registration statement of Vidara contemplated by
Section 2.1 of the Registration Rights Agreement registering the resale by
Holdings or the Holdings Members of any Registrable Securities (as defined in
the Registration Rights Agreement) held by Holdings or the Holdings Members
following Closing and prior to the submission of the Acceleration Letter or,
if such registration statement is filed pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the
Securities Act, the filing of such registration statement, including by virtue
of the distribution of Vidara Ordinary Shares by Holdings to the Holdings
Members after Closing and prior to the submission of the Acceleration Letter
or, if such registration statement is filed pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the
Securities Act, the filing of such registration statement, as well as, at
Buyers election, any Vidara Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of any
Buyer Warrants (the " _Resale Registration Statement_ "). Each of Vidara and
Buyer will cause the Resale Registration Statement to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. The Resale Registration Statement shall
include all information reasonably requested by each of Buyer and Vidara to be
included therein. If the Resale Registration Statement is not filed pursuant
to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act, each of Buyer and Vidara shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the Resale Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time. Vidara will advise Buyer, promptly after Vidara receives notice thereof,
of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Resale Registration Statement
or any SEC comments thereon. Prior to the initial filing of the Registration
Statement with the SEC, Vidara shall enter into the Registration Rights
Agreement with Holdings and the Holdings Members set forth in Exhibit A to the
Registration Rights Agreement.

 

(c) Buyer and Vidara shall promptly furnish to each other all information, and
take such other actions (including without limitation using their respective
reasonable best efforts to provide any required consents of their respective
independent auditors), as may reasonably be requested in connection with any
action by any of them in connection with this Section 5.15. Whenever any
Party learns of the occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Buyer
Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, the Resale Registration Statement
or any other filing made pursuant to

 



-78-  this _Section 5.15_, Buyer or Vidara, as the case may be, shall, to the
extent legally permitted, promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the SEC and/or mailing to the Buyer stockholders
such amendment or supplement.

(d) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement
or the Resale Registration Statement shall be made by Vidara without the prior
consent of Buyer, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Buyer
Proxy Statement will be made by Buyer without the prior written consent of
Vidara (in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and without providing the applicable Party the
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each of Buyer and Vidara will
advise the other Party, promptly after receiving oral or written notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement or the Resale
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Vidara Ordinary Shares for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for any amendment to
the Buyer Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, the Resale Registration
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information and will promptly provide the other Parties with
copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission.

 

(e) Each of Buyer and Vidara agrees, as to itself and its Affiliates, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Affiliates
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Buyer Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement (including the prospectus therein) or the Resale
Registration Statement (including the prospectus therein), and any amendments
or supplements thereto, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer, Holdings or Vidara discovers that the Registration
Statement (or the prospectus included therein), the Resale Registration
Statement (or the prospectus included therein) or the Buyer Proxy Statement
either (i) includes a misstatement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading or (ii) fails to comply with the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, in any material respect, then the Party that discovers such
information shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify the other
and Buyer and Vidara shall cooperate to promptly prepare and file with the
SEC, and in the case of the Buyer Proxy Statement to the extent required by
Law, disseminate to the Buyer stockholders, an appropriate amendment or
supplement to the applicable document correcting the material misstatement or
omission or causing such document to so comply.

 

(f) For the sake of clarity, (i) in no event shall any Party be deemed to have
supplied any information contemplated by  _Section 5.15(e)_ that relates
solely to the other Party or its Affiliates or their businesses, performance,
assets, liabilities, operations or Representatives, and (ii) in no event shall
Vidara be deemed to have supplied any information contemplated by _Section
5.15(e)_ that consists of or relates to the Vidara Companies objectives,
projections (whether, financial, operational or otherwise), pro forma results,
or plans for any period following the Effective Time.

 



-79- (g) Vidara will cause the prospectus included in the Registration Statement to
be mailed to the Buyer Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act and
Buyer will cause the Buyer Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Buyer
Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act and the Buyer Proxy Statement is
cleared for mailing.

(h) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, each of
Buyer and Vidara shall file with the SEC in a timely manner all forms, reports
and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC (including, in the case
of Vidara, any such forms, reports and documents that are or would otherwise
be required to be filed by it under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act from and
after the date that the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act and prior to the Closing Date) (collectively, the " _Reports_
"). Buyer and Vidara shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
none of the Reports filed by it after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
Closing Date, then on the date of such filing) will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit (or will have omitted) to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

5.16 _Buyer Stockholder Meeting_.

(a) Buyer shall take all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the Buyer Stockholders in accordance with applicable Law
and its Organizational Documents (the "Buyer Stockholder Meeting") as promptly
as practicable following the date upon which the Buyer Proxy Statement has
been cleared and the Registration Statement becomes effective for the purpose
of obtaining the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of
Buyer Shares as required by the DGCL (the "Buyer Stockholder Approval");
provided, however, that Buyer may also conduct the 2014 annual meeting of the
Buyer Stockholders as part of the Buyer Stockholder Meeting and include in the
agenda for the meeting the election of directors and such other proposals as
it would include on its agenda for the annual meeting in the ordinary
course. Except as required by Law, the Buyer shall not adjourn or postpone
the Buyer Stockholder Meeting after filing of the Registration Statement
without the consent of Holdings (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that the Buyer may, without the
consent of Holdings, adjourn or postpone the Buyer Stockholder Meeting (i) to
the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Buyer Proxy Statement or Registration Statement is provided
to the Buyer Stockholders or to permit dissemination of information which is
material to stockholders voting at the Buyer Stockholder Meeting, but only for
so long as the Buyer Board determines in good faith, after having consulted
with outside counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to
give the Buyer Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any such disclosure or
information so provided or disseminated, or (ii) if, as of the time the Buyer
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled (as set forth in the Buyer Proxy Statement),
there are insufficient Buyer Shares represented (either in person or by proxy)
(A) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Buyer
Stockholder Meeting, but only until a meeting can be held at which there are
a sufficient number of Buyer Shares represented to constitute a quorum or (B)
voting for the Buyer Stockholder Approval, but only until a meeting can be
held at which there are a sufficient number of votes of holders of Buyer
Shares to obtain the Buyer Stockholder Approval. Subject

 



-80-  to _Section 5.7_, the Buyer shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
from the Buyer Stockholders the Buyer Stockholder Approval and (ii) through
the Buyer Board make the Buyer Recommendation to the Buyer Stockholders (and
include the Buyer Recommendation in the Buyer Proxy Statement). Buyer shall
submit this Agreement to the Buyer Stockholders at the Buyer Stockholder
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Buyer Stockholder Approval.

(b) The Buyer shall, prior to the Buyer Stockholder Meeting, keep Holdings
reasonably informed in the two (2) weeks prior to the Buyer Stockholder
Meeting of the number of proxy votes received in respect of matters to be
acted upon at the Buyer Stockholder Meeting, and in any event shall provide
such number promptly upon the reasonable request of Holdings or its
representatives.

5.17 _Re-Registration of Vidara_. Each of Holdings and Vidara shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all necessary resolutions are passed,
actions are taken and filings are prepared and made, in each case, as are
required under the Irish Companies (Amendment) Act 1983 in order to effect the
re-registration of Vidara as a public limited company prior to the
Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC.

5.18 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Each of Buyer and Vidara shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Vidara Ordinary Shares to be issued
pursuant to the Merger and the Vidara Ordinary Shares held by Holdings
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be approved for listing on NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

5.19 _Reserved_.

 

5.20 _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the rights of Parent
and Merger Sub in this Section 5.20(a) to obtain Alternative Financing), Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or advisable to arrange the Financing and to consummate the
Financing at the Effective Time, including using reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all of the conditions precedent set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Buyer shall have the right from time to time to amend, restate, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under,
the Commitment Letter and/or substitute other debt financing for all or any
portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative debt financing
sources (together with any alternative financing as described in _Section
5.20(b)_ below, each an " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ , that any
such (i) amendment, restatement, supplement, replacement or other modification
to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter or (ii) Alternative
Financing, shall not, without the prior written consent of Holdings, (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount, unless the Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount on substantially the same terms as
provided in the applicable Commitment Letter) to be funded at Closing, (B)
impose new or additional conditions precedent or contingencies to the
Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or otherwise amend, modify,
or expand any conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing (unless
such conditions precedent or contingencies to the Alternative Financing would
not be reasonably expected to (x) prevent or 

 



-81-  delay in any material respect the Closing, or (y) adversely affect, impede
or impair in any material respect the ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (C) release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the lenders under the Commitment Letter
(except for assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the
terms of or in connection with the syndication of the Alternative Financing
or as otherwise expressly contemplated by the applicable Commitment Letter),
or (D) otherwise amend, restate, supplement, replace or modify any Commitment
Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay in
any material respect the ability of the Buyer to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Related Agreements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any Commitment Letter,
the borrower under any Financing or any Alternative Financing shall be U.S.
HoldCo.

(b) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (other than on account
of any Alternative Financing referred to in _Section 5.20(a)_ above having
been completed and other than due to the failure of a condition to the
consummation of the Financing resulting from a material breach of any
representation, warranty, or covenant of Holdings and the Vidara Companies set
forth in this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
6.1_ of this Agreement) and as a result Buyer would reasonably be expected to
not have sufficient funds to pay the Estimated Cash Consideration and any
other amounts required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain any such portion from alternative debt sources as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event in an amount that will
still enable Buyer to pay the Estimated Cash Consideration and any other
amounts required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) As applicable based on the nature of the Financing or the Alternative
Financing, as the case may be, Holdings shall cause the Vidara Companies to
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Buyer (and use reasonable best
efforts to cause the independent accounting firm and other advisers retained
by the Vidara Companies to cooperate with Buyer) in connection with the
Financing, including (i) participating, upon reasonable advance notice, in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, rating agency
presentations, and drafting sessions, and participating in reasonable and
customary due diligence, in each case with or by the Financing Sources (or
prospective lenders or investors in any Financing) and assisting Buyer in
the preparation of customary offering documents and materials (including any
confidential offering memoranda or circulars and rating agency presentations)
and the review and comment on the definitive documentation for the Financing
or an Alternative Financing to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, (ii)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish to Buyer, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, with the Required Financial Statements and coordinate
with Buyer in the preparation of pro forma historical financial statements,
and (iii) using reasonable best efforts to cause its current or former
independent accountants (including of predecessor owners of any business) to
provide assistance and cooperation in any Financing, including participating
in a reasonable number of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence
sessions and providing customary "comfort letters" and any necessary written
consents to use their audit reports and to be named as "Experts" in any
offering documentation relating to any Alternative Financing. In addition,
U.S. Holdco shall, and Holdings shall cause U.S. Holdco to, and Holdings shall
cause the Vidara Companies (other than U.S. Holdco) to use reasonable best

 



-82-  efforts to (A) in the case of U.S. Holdco, incur the indebtedness
contemplated by the Financing or any Alternative Financing, and in the case of
each Vidara Company, provide customary certificates, opinions and other
documents and instruments, and take all necessary corporate action (subject to
the performance of Buyers obligations pursuant to _Section 5.24_), to permit
the consummation of any Financing and any Alternative Financing and to permit
the proceeds thereof to be made available for use in accordance with _Schedule
1_ at the Effective Time, including, without limitation, executing and
delivering prior to the Closing Date (or, in the case of U.S. Holdco, the
applicable closing date for any Financing or Alternative Financing),
definitive financing documents, including credit agreements, indentures,
intercreditor agreements, pledge and security documents, and certificates
(including borrowing base and solvency certificates), or other documents, to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer and otherwise facilitating the
granting or perfection of collateral to secure any Financing or Alternative
Financing, delivering certificates representing equity interests constituting
collateral, authorizing intellectual property filings with respect to
intellectual property constituting collateral and executing and delivering,
and permitting the filing and registration of, mortgages with respect to
owned real property constituting collateral and obtaining releases of existing
Liens, (B) furnishing Buyer and any Financing Sources promptly, and in any
event at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date (or if earlier, the

sentence of  _Section 10.9_ will survive any termination hereof; _provided_
, _further_ , _however_ , nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall relieve any
Party of any Liability for any breach by such Party of this Agreement prior
to the Effective Time.

8.4 _Termination Fee; Reverse Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that:

 

(i)(A) a Buyer Alternative Proposal shall have been made to Buyer or to the
Buyers stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced a
Buyer Alternative Proposal and such Buyer Alternative Proposal shall not have
been publicly withdrawn, (B) either Buyer or Holdings terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or Holdings terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ and (C) Buyer enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or consummates a Buyer Alternative Proposal with the Person
or Persons making such Buyer Alternative Proposal or any of such Persons or
Persons Affiliates or any group that includes such Person or Persons or any
of their Affiliates within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is
terminated; or

 

(ii)(A) this Agreement is terminated by Holdings pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)(i)_ and (B) the notice of termination to Buyer includes a demand from
Holdings, which demand shall be irrevocable, to receive the Termination Fee.

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.4(a), Buyer
shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
later of (x) the date of such termination and (y) the date of the event giving
rise to Buyers obligation to pay the Termination Fee under Section
8.4(a)(i), pay or cause to be paid to Holdings or its designees a termination
fee in an amount equal to US$23,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of same day funds. Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for
the amount thereof, and without in any way increasing the amount of the
Termination Fee or expanding the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
to be paid, it is agreed that the Termination Fee is a liquidated damage and
not a penalty and that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If Buyer becomes obligated to pay
the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.4(a), Holdings agrees that its
right to receive the Termination Fee from Buyer shall be

 



-93-  its sole and exclusive remedy against Buyer and, upon payment of the
Termination Fee, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
Liability to Holdings or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Holdings pursuant
to _Section 8.1(h)_ and (ii) the notice of termination to Buyer includes a
demand from Holdings, which demand shall be irrevocable, to receive the
Reverse Termination Fee, then Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later
than three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause
to be paid to Holdings or its designees a termination fee in an amount equal
to US$44,000,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same
day funds. Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount
thereof, and without in any way increasing the amount of the Reverse
Termination Fee or expanding the circumstances in which the Reverse
Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed that the Reverse Termination Fee
is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty and that in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If
Buyer becomes obligated to pay the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 8.4(b)_, Holdings agrees that its right to receive the Reverse
Termination Fee from Buyer shall be its sole and exclusive remedy against
Buyer and, upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall have any Liability to Holdings or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby

 

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Holdings or Buyer
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ and (ii) if such termination is by
Holdings, the notice of termination to Buyer includes a demand from Holdings,
which demand shall be irrevocable, to receive the Expense Reimbursement
Amount, Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business
Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Holdings
or its designees an amount equal to US$13,500,000 (the " _Expense
Reimbursement Amount_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds. Solely
for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in
any way increasing the amount of the Expense Reimbursement Amount or expanding
the circumstances in which the Expense Reimbursement Amount is to be paid, it
is agreed that the Expense Reimbursement Amount constitutes reasonable
compensation for the costs and expenses, including opportunity costs, incurred
by Holdings and the Vidara Companies in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and not a penalty and that in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay the Expense Reimbursement Amount on more than one occasion. If
Buyer becomes obligated to pay the Expense Reimbursement Amount pursuant to
this _Section 8.4(c)_, Holdings agrees that its right to receive the Expense
Reimbursement Amount from Buyer shall be its sole and exclusive remedy against
Buyer and, upon payment of the Expense Reimbursement Amount, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any Liability to Holdings or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. If Buyer fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee or the Reverse
Termination Fee, as the case may be, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Holdings commences an action or proceeding that results in a judgment against
Buyer for such fee, Buyer shall pay to Holdings, together with such fee,
interest on such fee from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate
per annum equal to six percent (6%).

 



-94- 8.5 _Enforcement_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages
alone. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof. 

(b) Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by such Party, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 8.5_. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction all in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 8.5_.

 

(c) To the extent any Party brings any action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3_ hereof) when
expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time
during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including,
without limitation, the provisions of _Sections 8.5(a)_ ,  _8.5(b)_ and
_8.5(c)_ , the right of Holdings or any Vidara Company to obtain an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to cause Buyer to
consummate the Closing shall only be available prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement and only in the event that (i) all conditions in _Article
VI_ and _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot
be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which shall be capable of
being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied, and remain
satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have occurred and Buyer fails to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , (ii) the Financing has been funded or is
reasonably expected to be funded at the Closing in accordance with its terms,
and (iii) Holdings has irrevocably confirmed to Buyer in writing that if
specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then Holdings
will perform its obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.1_.
For the avoidance of doubt, (A) under no circumstance shall Holdings be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance
to compel the Closing (which is only available to the extent expressly
permitted by this _Section 8.5(d)_ ) and payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee (which is only available to the extent, expressly 

 



-95-  permitted by _Section 8.4(b)_), and (B) under no circumstance shall
Holdings be entitled to enforce specifically Buyers obligation to seek to
cause the Financing to be funded or to effect the Closing if the Commitment
Letter have not been funded in accordance with the terms thereof (or would not
have been funded at the Closing in accordance with the terms thereof even if
Buyer was ready, willing and above to otherwise effect the Closing).

ARTICLE IX

9.1 _ Survival_. Each and every representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
expire as of, and shall not survive, the Closing and neither Holdings nor any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Vidara Companies following the Closing), on the other, nor any
of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners,
members or representatives shall have any liability whatsoever with respect
to any such representation or warranty. Each and every covenant, undertaking
or agreement contained in this Agreement (other than the Surviving Covenants)

Parties to this Agreement, nor any of their respective Affiliates, nor any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners,
members or representatives shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to
any such covenant, undertaking or agreement. Each Surviving Covenant shall
survive the Closing and will remain in full force and effect thereafter in
accordance with their respective terms. For purposes of this Agreement "

10.3 _Waivers_. The failure of a Party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same, except as provided in _Section 5.7_. No waiver
by a Party of any condition or of any breach of any term,

 



-97-  covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be
effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or more instances shall

breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition or breach of any
other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

 

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and such
counterparts may be delivered in electronic format (including by fax and
email). Such delivery of counterparts shall be conclusive evidence of the
intent to be bound hereby and each such counterpart and copies produced
therefrom shall have the same effect as an original. To the extent
applicable, the foregoing constitutes the election of the Parties to invoke
any law authorizing electronic signatures.

10.5 _Interpretation_. The headings preceding the text of Articles and
Sections included in this Agreement and the headings to Sections of the
Disclosure Schedule are for convenience only and shall not be deemed part of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule or be given any effect in
interpreting this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule. The use of the
masculine, feminine or neuter gender herein shall not limit any provision of
this Agreement. The use of the terms "including" or "include" shall in all
cases herein mean "including, without limitation" or "include, without
limitation," respectively. Underscored references to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules shall refer to those portions of this Agreement. Time
is of the essence of each and every covenant, agreement and obligation in this
Agreement. Neither Holdings, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand,
shall be deemed to be in breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement if
such Partys deemed breach is the result of any action or inaction on the
part of the other. Any information "made available" by Holdings to Buyer shall
include only (i) that information included in the materials posted to the
virtual data room hosted by IntraLinks and made available to Buyer and its
Representatives, but only if so posted and made available on or before the
date that is two days prior to the date of this Agreement; and (ii) the
employment related information contemplated in _Section 3.16(d)_, which was
separately provided to Buyer in writing.

10.6 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF TO THE EXTENT SUCH
PRINCIPLES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION.

10.7 _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement and the Related Agreements shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

10.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned (including by operation of law) by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that each
of Buyer and U.S. HoldCo may pledge their respective rights hereunder as
security for any Financing or Alternative Financing source, provided that no
such pledge pursuant to this _Section 10.8_ shall relieve Buyer

 



-98-  or U.S. HoldCo of its obligations hereunder. For all purposes hereof, a
transfer, sale or disposition of a majority of the capital stock or other
voting interest of Buyer (whether by contract or otherwise) shall be deemed
an assignment hereunder. Any purported assignment in contravention of this
_Section 10.8_ shall be null and void.

 

10.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the Parties and no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon
third parties, either express or implied, any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or other right. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(a) the Persons referred to in _Section 5.13_, and for purposes of _Section
5.14(c)_ the Holdings Members, are hereby made express third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement, with all of the rights, remedies, claims,
liabilities, reimbursements, causes of action and other rights accorded
such Persons under this Agreement and the Related Agreements, and (b) each
Financing Source shall be an express third party beneficiary of and shall be
entitled to rely upon and enforce _Section 10.1_, _Section 10.12_, 
_Section 10.13_ and _Section 10.18_ hereof, and this _Section 10.9_, and
each Financing Party may enforce such provisions. Buyer and Vidara agree and
acknowledge that their mutual intention that the Persons identified in the
foregoing clause (a) benefit from _Section 5.13_ and _Section 5.14(c)_ is a
material part of the Parties purpose in entering into this Agreement and is a
material inducement to Holdings and Vidaras entry into this Agreement.

10.10 _Further Assurances._ Upon the reasonable request of Buyer or Holdings,
each Party will on and after the Closing Date execute and deliver to the
other Parties such other documents, assignments and other instruments as may
be reasonably required to effectuate completely the Reorganization, the
Merger, and to effect and evidence the provisions of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

10.11 _Entire Understanding_. The Exhibits, Schedules and Disclosure Schedule
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof. This Agreement and the Related Agreements set forth the entire
agreement and understanding of the Parties and supersedes any and all prior

DEEMED TO PREVENT ANY PARTY FROM SEEKING TO REMOVE ANY ACTION TO A FEDERAL
COURT IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE); (C) AGREE TO WAIVE TO THE FULL EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR ACTION IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT

agrees, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, that it will not bring or
support any litigation, proceeding or other Action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement, any Related Document or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Related Document, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing, the Commitment
Letter, any Alternative Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or,
if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and appellate courts thereof). The provisions of this _Section 10.12(b)_
shall be enforceable by each Financing Source.

 

10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF

 



-100-  LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.13_.

 

10.14 _Disclosure Schedule_. The disclosures in a particular Disclosure
Schedule are to be taken as relating to each other Disclosure Schedule to the
extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other Disclosure Schedule is
reasonably apparent. The inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedule
shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material to
the Party disclosing such information. In addition, matters reflected in the
Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar
amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended
to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included
or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of
the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter, or
other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business,
and no Party shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of any such
items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

10.15 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed.

 

10.16 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Party. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations

 



-101-  promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. All
references in this Agreement to (a) "USD", "$" or "dollars" shall mean U.S.
denominated dollars and (b) "EUR", "" or "euros" are to euros, the lawful
currency of Ireland. Although the same or similar subject matters may be
addressed in different provisions of this Agreement, the Parties intend that,
except as reasonably apparent on the face of the Agreement or as expressly
provided in this Agreement, each such provision shall be read separately, be
given independent significance and not be construed as limiting any other
provision of this Agreement (whether or not more general or more specific in
scope, substance or content).

10.17 _Provision Respecting Representation of Holdings_. Each of the Parties
hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, member,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Mayer Brown LLP may serve
as counsel to each and any member of the Vidara Group, on the one hand, and
Holdings and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Mayer Brown LLP may
serve as counsel to the Vidara Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Vidara Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation or any continued representation of Holdings and/or any of its
Subsidiaries, and each of the Parties hereby consents thereto and waives any
conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such Parties shall cause
any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation.

 

10.18 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that all claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement,
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
enter into, this Agreement) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be made only against (and are those solely of) the entities that are
expressly identified as parties to this Agreement in the Preamble to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Holdings agrees,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and each of its and its Affiliates
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, controlling persons, agents or
Representatives (collectively, the " _Vidara Parties_ ") that the Financing
Sources shall be subject to no liability or claims to the Vidara Parties in
connection with the Financing or in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise.

2 _Registration Rights_.

 

2.1 _Shelf Registration_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the initial filing of the
Merger Registration Statement with the SEC (or such later date as shall be
mutually agreed by the Company and the Majority Holders), the Company shall
file with the SEC a "shelf" Registration Statement covering the resale of all
of the Registrable Securities (based on the number thereof as estimated
at the time of filing of

 



3  such Registration Statement by the Company to be outstanding at the
Effective Time) for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to
Rule 415 or, if Rule 415 is not available for offers and sales of the
Registrable Securities, by such other means of distribution of Registrable
Securities as the Majority Holders may reasonably specify (the " _Initial
Registration Statement_ "). The Initial Registration Statement shall be on
Form S-3 (except if the Company is then ineligible pursuant to SEC Guidance to
register for resale the Registrable Securities on Form S-3, in which case such
registration shall be on Form S-1) subject to the provisions of Section
2.1(e) and shall contain (except if otherwise required pursuant to written
comments received from the SEC upon a review of such Registration Statement)
the "Plan of Distribution" section attached hereto as  _Annex I_.
Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this Section 2.1(a)
and Section 2.1(b), in the event the SEC informs the Company that all of the
Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be
registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration
statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the Holders
thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to file amendments to the
Initial Registration Statement as required by the SEC or (ii) withdraw the
Initial Registration Statement and file a new registration statement (a " _New
Registration Statement_ "), in either case covering the maximum number
of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the SEC, on Form S-3
or such other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities
as a secondary offering; _provided, however_ , that prior to filing such
amendment or New Registration Statement, the Company shall be obligated to
use its reasonable best efforts to advocate with the SEC for the registration
of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the SEC Guidance,
including without limitation, Section 612.09 of the Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretations of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance with
respect Rule 415, dated January 26, 2009. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of the number
of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular
Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the
Company used reasonable best efforts to advocate with the SEC for the
registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), the number
of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration Statement will
be reduced on a _pro rata_ basis based on the total number of
unregistered Registrable Securities held by such Holders (if prior to the
Closing, based on the number thereof as estimated at the time by the Company
to be outstanding at the Effective Time), subject to any determination by the
SEC that certain Holders must be reduced first based on the number of
Registrable Securities held by such Holders. In the event the Company amends
the Initial Registration Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as
the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC, as promptly as allowed by SEC
Guidance, one or more registration statements on Form S-3 (except if the
Company is then ineligible to register for resale the Registrable Securities
on Form S-3, in which case such registrations shall be on Form S-1) to
register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for
resale on the Initial Registration Statement, as amended, or the
New Registration Statement.

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to cause the Initial
Registration Statement (as may be amended) or the New Registration Statement,
as applicable, to become or to be declared effective as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, (ii) with respect to each other
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.1, to cause each such
Registration Statement to become or to be declared effective as soon as
reasonably practicable after the filing thereof, and (iii) subject to Section
2.4(a) hereof, to keep each Registration Statement continuously effective
under the Securities Act until the earlier of (x) such time as all of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been
publicly sold by the Holders, (y) the date on which the registration rights
provided to each Holder terminate pursuant to Section 2.8 (the "
_Effectiveness Period_ ").

(c) The Company shall ensure that each Registration Statement (including any
amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall
comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein,

 



4  or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of Prospectuses, in
the light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading. Each
Registration Statement shall also cover, to the extent allowable under the
Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416), such
indeterminate number of additional Ordinary Shares resulting from stock
splits, stock dividends or similar transactions with respect to the
Registrable Securities.

(d) Each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company a completed Questionnaire in
the form attached to this Agreement as _Annex II_ (a " _Selling Shareholder
Questionnaire_ ") on a date that is not less than five (5) Business Days prior
to the date of filing of a Registration Statement. Each Holder further agrees
that it shall not be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in a
Registration Statement or use the Prospectus for offers and resales of
Registrable Securities at any time, unless such Holder has returned to the
Company a completed and signed Selling Shareholder Questionnaire. If a Holder
of Registrable Securities returns a Selling Shareholder Questionnaire after
the deadline specified in the previous sentence, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are required to name such
Holder as a selling securityholder in the Registration Statement or any pre-
effective or post-effective amendment thereto and to include (to the extent
not theretofore included) in the Registration Statement the
Registrable Securities identified in such late Selling Shareholder
Questionnaire; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not in any
event be obligated to effect more than two (2) such post-effective amendments
under this Section 2.1(d) in any six-month period (each such post-effective
amendment, a " _Holder POSAM_ "). Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that the
information in the Selling Shareholder Questionnaire will be used by the
Company in the preparation of the Registration Statement and hereby consents
to the inclusion of such information in the Registration Statement.

 

(e) In the event that Form S-3 is not available for the registration of the
resale of Registrable Securities hereunder, the Company shall (i) register
the resale of the Registrable Securities on Form S-1 or another appropriate
form reasonably acceptable to the Majority Holders, and (ii) undertake to
register the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 as soon as such form
is available, _provided_ that, subject to Section 2.4(a) hereof, the Company
shall maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement that is on a
form other than Form S-3 then in effect, until such time as a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 covering the Registrable Securities has been declared
effective by the SEC.

(f) _Underwritten Offerings_.

 

(i) Holders shall be entitled to offer and sell their Registrable Securities
pursuant to an underwritten public offering provided that the aggregate
amount of Registrable Securities to be offered and sold in such offering are
reasonably expected to result in aggregate gross proceeds of not less than $25
million (each such underwritten offering, a " _Permitted Underwritten
Offering_ "). In the event that Holders intend to sell Registrable Securities
in a Permitted Underwritten Offering, the Holders intending to participate in
any such Permitted Underwritten Offering (the " _Participating Holders_ ")
shall so notify the Company, which notice shall be delivered to the Company
not less than twenty-five (25) days prior to the date the underwriting
agreement for such Permitted Underwritten Offering is executed (the "
_Underwriting Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Underwriting Notice
may be delivered to the Company with respect to the sale of any Registrable
Securities that are not covered by an effective Registration Statement.
Following delivery of the Underwriting Notice, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to give written notice of such request for a
Permitted Underwritten Offering to all Holders of Registrable Securities
within five (5) days after receipt of the Underwriting Notice and any Holders
who did not deliver such Underwriting Notice may also participate in the
Permitted Underwritten Offering if they provide the Company with written
notice at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date the underwriting
agreement for such Permitted Underwritten Offering is executed.

 



5 (ii) The bookrunning underwriter(s) for any Permitted Underwritten Offering
shall be selected by the Company with the consent of the Holders of a
majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities to be offered in such
Permitted Underwritten Offering (the " _Holders of a Majority in Interest of
Participating Holders_ ") (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned); _provided,_ that the Holders of a Majority in
Interest of Participating Holders may select up to two (2) co-managers in each
Permitted Underwritten Offering with the consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

(iii) In connection with any Permitted Underwritten Offering and if requested
by the underwriters, the Company and all Holders proposing to distribute
their securities through such underwriting agree to enter into an underwriting
agreement with the underwriters selected for such underwriting, which
underwriting agreement shall be in customary form and reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to the Company (provided that in no event shall the
Company be required to comply with any lock-up provisions for longer than
sixty (60) days from the date of the underwriting agreement), the Holders of
a Majority in Interest of Participating Holders and the underwriters and
shall contain such representations and warranties by the Company and the
Participating Holders and such other terms and provisions as are customarily
contained in agreements of this type, including, but not limited to,
indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in this Agreement or as
are otherwise then customary (if more extensive), provisions for the delivery
of officers certificates, opinions of counsel for the Company and the
Participating Holders and accountants "comfort" letters, and shall also use
reasonable efforts to provide lock-up arrangements by the Companys officers
and directors not to exceed sixty (60) days and which provide customary
exceptions including an exception for shares sold pursuant to written 10b5-1
plans that are in effect as of the date of such lock-up agreements.

 

(iv) If the managing underwriter of a Permitted Underwritten Offering advises
the Holders proposing to distribute their securities in such offering that,
in its good faith view, the number of Registrable Securities and, if permitted
hereunder, other securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds
the largest number of securities which can reasonably be sold in an orderly
manner without having a significant and adverse effect on such offering (the "
_Maximum Offering Amount_ "), then the rights of the Holders to include their
securities in such offering shall be limited to the Maximum Offering Amount
in the following order of priority:

(A) first, all Registrable Securities requested by the Participating Holders
to be included in such offering shall be included, but, if the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the
Maximum Offering Amount, then the number of Registrable Securities that
each Participating Holder will be entitled to include in such offering will
be allocated on a _pro rata_ basis based on the number of Registrable
Securities owned by such Participating Holder to the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities owned by all Participating Holders; and

(B) second, other securities, if any, requested to be included in such
offering to the extent permitted hereunder.

(v) A Majority in Interest of the Participating Holders shall have the right
to cancel a proposed Permitted Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Section
2.1(f) when, (i) prior

 



6  to any public announcement of the proposed Permitted Underwritten Offering,
the managing underwriter of the Permitted Underwritten Offering advises the
Participating Holders and the Company that in its good faith view, market
conditions are so unfavorable as to be seriously detrimental to such Permitted
Underwritten Offering or (ii) the request for cancellation is based upon
information relating to the Company that the managing underwriter of the
Permitted Underwritten Offering determines in good faith to be materially
adverse and that is different from the information publicly available or
otherwise known to the Participating Holders at the time of the
Underwriting Notice, provided that the cancellation occurs within three (3)
business days of such information becoming publicly available or otherwise
known to the Participating Holders. Such cancellation of a Permitted
Underwritten Offering shall not be counted as one of the total of the two (2)
or three (3) Permitted Underwritten Offerings referenced in Section 2.1(f)(vi)
hereof.

 

(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) if the Company furnishes to the
Participating Holders a certificate signed by the Companys principal
executive officer that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
the Company, it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its
shareholders for a Permitted Underwritten Offering to be effected at
such time, the Company shall have the right to defer such Permitted
Underwritten Offering for a period of not more than sixty (60) days from the
date of the Underwriting Notice, _provided_ that the Company shall not
exercise this deferral right more than once in any twelve (12) month period;
(B) the Company shall not be obligated to take any action to effect any
Permitted Underwritten Offering during the ninety (90) day period following
the closing of any underwritten public offering of the Companys securities
(including a Permitted Underwritten Offering); and (C) the Company shall not
be obligated to take any action to effect (a) more than two (2) Permitted
Underwritten Offerings in any twelve (12) month period and (b) more than
three (3) Permitted Underwritten Offerings during the term of this Agreement.

2.2  _Piggyback Offering_. In the event that the Company proposes to
undertake a public underwritten offering of its Ordinary Shares for its own
account and for the primary purpose of raising cash proceeds, pursuant to an
effective registration statement other than a registration statement on Form
S-4 or Form S-8, the Company shall consider in good faith offering the Holders
the opportunity to sell all or a portion of their Registrable Securities in
such underwritten offering after taking into consideration factors the
Company deems relevant in conducting its offering, including, but not limited
to, the timing of the proposed offering, the Companys financing objectives,
the number of Holders at such time and the difficulty of including any
Holders that wish to participate in such offering. Compliance by the Company
of its obligations under this Section 2.2 shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations contemplated by Section 2.1 hereof and inclusion of Registrable
Securities in an underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall not
constitute a Permitted Underwritten Offering under Section 2.1(f).

 

2.3 _Obligations of the Company_. In addition to the other obligations of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall: _ _

(a) not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the filing of a Registration
Statement and not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the filing of
any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for
annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports
on Form 8-K and any similar or successor reports, including any proxy
statements under the Exchange Act (collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ ")), the
Company shall furnish to the Holders (or, in lieu thereof, the Holders
counsel described in Section 2.3(b), if any) copies of such Registration
Statement, Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, as proposed to be
filed; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company shall not be required to
furnish to the Holders any prospectus supplement being prepared and filed
solely to name new or additional selling securityholders unless such Holders
are named in such prospectus supplement, (ii) in the event that any
Registration Statement is on Form S-1 (or other form 

 



7  which does not permit incorporation by reference), the Company shall not be
required to furnish to the Holders any prospectus supplement that does not
contain substantive information other than information included in an SEC
Report that would be incorporated by reference in such Registration Statement
if such Registration Statement were on Form S-3 (or other form which permits
incorporation by reference); _provided that,_ if for any reason Rule 172 is
becomes unavailable, such prospectus supplements shall be furnished by the
Company, and (iii) after it has been filed with the SEC, the Company shall
furnish a copy of the Initial Registration Statement to any Holder
upon written request;

(b) permit a single firm of counsel (which such counsel shall be confirmed to
the Company in writing) designated by the Holders of a majority-in-interest
of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to review
such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto within
a reasonable period of time prior to the filing thereof (but only to the
extent any such amendment or supplement is required to be furnished to the
Holders pursuant Section 2.3(a) above), and use reasonable best efforts to
reflect in such documents any comments as such counsel may reasonably
propose; 

(c) subject to Section 2.4(a), prepare and file with the SEC such amendments
and supplements to a Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in
connection with such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement in compliance with the requirements of the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and
current, effective and free from any material misstatement or omission to
state a material fact during the Effectiveness Period;

(d) furnish to any Holder with respect to the Registrable Securities
registered under a Registration Statement such number of copies of such
Registration Statement, Prospectuses and preliminary prospectuses in
conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and such other documents as the Holder may
reasonably request, in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of all or any of the Registrable Securities by the Holder;

 

(e) use its reasonable best efforts to register and qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by a Registration Statement under such other securities or
blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the
Holders; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required in connection
therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file
a general consent to service of process in any state or jurisdiction in which
it is not now qualified or has not consented;

(f) notify the Holders in writing as promptly as reasonably possible (and, in
the case of (i)(A) below, not less than three (3) Business Days prior to such
filing): (i)(A) when a Prospectus or any prospectus supplement (but only to
the extent notice is required under Section 2.3(a) above) or post-effective
amendment to a Registration Statement is proposed to be filed, (B) when the
SEC notifies the Company whether there will be a "review" of such Registration
Statement and whenever the SEC comments in writing on such Registration
Statement (in which case the Company shall provide true and complete copies
thereof and all written responses thereto to each of the Holders, but not
information which the Company reasonably believes would constitute material
non-public information) and (C) with respect to each Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment, when the same has been declared effective; (ii)
of any request by the SEC or any other Governmental Authority for amendments
or supplements to a Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional
information; (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement covering any or all of the
Registrable Securities or the initiation of any Legal Proceeding for that
purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect
to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any
of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation
or threatening of any Legal Proceeding for such purpose; (v) of the occurrence
of any event or

 



8  passage of time that makes the financial statements included or incorporated
by reference in a Registration Statement ineligible for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein or any statement made in such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that
requires any revisions to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or other
documents so that, in the case of such Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus,
or any form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading; and (vi) of the occurrence or
existence of any pending corporate development with respect to the Company
that the Company believes may be material and that, in the determination of
the Company, makes it not in the best interest of the Company to allow
continued availability of a Registration Statement or Prospectus; _provided_
, that each Holder shall agree to keep any and all of such information
confidential until such information otherwise becomes public; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that notwithstanding each Holders agreement to keep such
information confidential, each such Holder makes no acknowledgement that any
such information is material non-public information;

 

(g) following the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 2.3(f)(v),
as promptly as reasonably possible, prepare a supplement or amendment,
including a post-effective amendment, to the affected Registration Statement
or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered, no Registration Statement nor any
Prospectus will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus, or any form of prospectus
or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading and provide to each Holder such number of copies as may
be reasonably requested of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented;

(h) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities
registered pursuant to this Section 2 to be listed on each securities
exchange and trading system on which the Ordinary Shares are then listed;

(i) use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order
by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or to
promptly obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

 

(j) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement, including without
limitation, Rule 172 under the Securities Act; file any preliminary or final
prospectus, including any supplement or amendment thereof, with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; promptly inform the Holders in
writing if, at any time during the period of effectiveness of a Registration
Statement, the Company does not satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 172
and, as a result thereof, the Holders are required to make available a
prospectus in connection with any disposition of the Registrable Securities;
and take such other actions as may be necessary to facilitate the registration
of the Registrable Securities hereunder;

 

(k) use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of or, if issued,
promptly obtain the withdrawal of any suspension of the qualification (or
exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction;

(l) at any time after the filing of the Initial Registration Statement and
throughout the Effectiveness Period, make available, upon written request, at
reasonable times at the Companys

 



9  principal place of business or such other reasonable place for inspection by
the Holders who shall certify to the Company that they have a current
intention to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration
Statement, the Holders counsel described in Section 2.3(b) and any
underwriter(s) of a Permitted Underwritten Offering and counsel for such
underwriter(s), such financial and other information and books and records of
the Company, and cause the officers, employees, counsel and independent
certified public accountants of the Company to respond to such inquiries, as
shall be reasonably necessary, in their reasonable belief, to conduct a
reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such party shall be required to agree
in writing pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement to maintain in
confidence and not to disclose to any other person any information or records
designated by the Company as being confidential, until such time as (A) such
information becomes a matter of public record (whether by virtue of its
inclusion in a Registration Statement or otherwise) or (B) such person shall
be required to disclose such information pursuant to a subpoena or order of
any court or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the
matter (subject to the requirements of such order, and only after such person
shall have given the Company prompt prior written notice of such requirement
to allow the Company at its expense to undertake appropriate action to prevent
disclosure of the information designated as confidential by the Company); and

(m) cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and
delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be delivered
to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement (or electronic book
entries in lieu thereof), which certificates shall be free, to the extent
permitted by law, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable
Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any
such Holders may reasonably request.

2.4  _Obligations of Holders_.

(a) _Suspension Notice_.

 

(i) Each Holder further agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable
Securities that, upon receipt of (i) a notice from the Company of the
occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 2.3(f)(ii)-(vi)
and/or (ii) the notice required by 2.3(f)(i)(A) with respect to any post-
effective amendment to a Registration Statement (each a " _Suspension Notice_
"), such Holder will, regardless of whether the Company has breached its
obligations under Section 2.4(a)(ii), forthwith discontinue disposition of
such Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement for the
period (the " _Suspension Period_ ") beginning on the receipt of such
Suspension Notice by the Holder until the Holders are advised in writing (the
" _Advice_ ") by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus (as it
may have been supplemented or amended) may be resumed.

(ii) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to not allow any
Suspension Period (other than a Suspension Period caused by a Holder POSAM) to
exceed 30 consecutive days and the aggregate of all Suspension Periods
(excluding any Suspension Period caused by a Holder POSAM) to exceed 90 days
in any twelve-month period.

(iii) Subject to Section 2.4(b), notwithstanding the receipt of a Suspension
Notice from the Company, any Holder may sell its Registrable Securities
pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise (other than pursuant to or under the
Registration Statement), _provided that_ at the time of such sale such Holder
is not in possession of material non-public information.

(b) _Transfer Restrictions_. Each Holder covenants and agrees that the Shares
may be disposed of only pursuant to an effective registration statement
under, and in compliance with the requirements of, the Securities Act
(including a Registration Statement hereunder), or pursuant to an

 



10  available exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with any
applicable U.S. state and federal securities laws. In connection with any
transfer of Shares other than (i) pursuant to an effective registration
statement (including a Registration Statement hereunder), (ii) to the Company,
(iii) to an Affiliate of a Holder or (iv) pursuant to Rule 144 ( _provided
that_ the Holder provides the Company with reasonable assurances (in the form
of seller and broker representation letters) that the securities may be sold
pursuant to such rule), the Company may require the transferor thereof
to provide, and the transferor agrees to provide, to the Company an opinion
of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the
Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not
require registration of such transferred Shares under the Securities Act. Each
Specified Holder further covenants and agrees not to knowingly transfer Shares
to a Person or an Affiliate of such Person (each a  _"Prohibited Transferee"_
) that (i) has filed, or to the Specified Holders knowledge is required to
file, a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company or (ii) has
announced to the general public or, to the Specified Holders knowledge has,
any intention to acquire or influence control of the Company. In the case of a
privately-negotiated or "block" trade of Shares, the transferring Specified
Holder shall make reasonable inquiry, or shall cause such Specified Holders
broker or agent to make reasonable inquiry on the Specified Holders behalf,
as to the identity of the transferee for purposes of determining whether such
transferee is a Prohibited Transferee.

 

(c) _Confidentiality_. Each Participating Holder in a Permitted Underwritten
Offering agrees to keep confidential any and all non-public information
regarding the Company that such Participating Holder receives from or on
behalf of the Company or any underwriter in such Permitted Underwritten
Offering during the period following the delivery of the Underwriting Notice
pertaining to such Permitted Underwritten Offering and through the completion
of termination of such Permitted Underwritten Offering.

2.5 _Expenses of Registration_. All Registration Expenses shall be borne by
the Company. All Selling Expenses shall be borne by the holders of the
securities registered or sold, as applicable, _pro rata_ on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities registered or sold, as applicable, except
that Selling Expenses constituting any fees, commissions or discounts of any
underwriter or broker dealer or any transfer taxes or stamp duties shall be
payable by the Holder of the Registrable Securities to which such fees,
commissions, discounts, taxes or duties relate.

2.6 _Indemnification_. In the event any Registrable Securities are included
in a Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement:

(a) The Company shall, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Holder, the officers, directors,
agents, partners, members, managers, shareholders, Affiliates and employees of
each of them, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for such
Holder, any each Person who controls any such Holder or underwriter (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) and the officers, directors, partners, members, managers,
shareholders, agents and employees of each such controlling Person, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and costs and
expenses of investigating and defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or related action or proceeding) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as
incurred, that arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any
Prospectus or any form of prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus (as
defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) or in any amendment
or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or
relating to any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of any Prospectus, preliminary prospectus, form of

 



11  prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus, or supplement thereto, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, or any
violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities laws,
except to the extent, but only to the extent, that (A) such
untrue statements, alleged untrue statements, omissions or alleged omissions
are based solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing
to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein, or to the extent that
such information relates to such Holder or such Holders proposed method of
distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and approved by such
Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, such Prospectus,
preliminary prospectus, form of prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus
or in any amendment or supplement thereto (it being understood that each
Holder has approved _Annex I_ hereto for this purpose), (B) in the case of an
occurrence of an event of the type specified in Sections 2.3(f)(i)(A) (with
respect to any post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement) and
2.3(f)(ii)-(vi), related to the use by a Holder or any underwriter retained by
such Holder of an outdated or defective Prospectus after the Company has
notified such Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated or defective
and prior to the receipt by such Holder of the Advice contemplated and defined
in Section 2.4(a), but only if and to the extent that following the receipt
of the Advice the misstatement or omission giving rise to such Loss would have
been corrected in a Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) or supplement
thereto delivered to such Holder or underwriter or (C) any such Losses
arise out of the Holders (or any other indemnified Persons) failure to send
or give a copy of the Prospectus or supplement (as then amended or
supplemented) to the Persons asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or
prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities to
such Person in which such delivery is required by the Securities Act
(including Rule 172 under the Securities Act) if such statement or omission
was corrected in such Prospectus or supplement. The Company shall notify the
Holders promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any Legal
Proceeding arising from or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement of which the Company is aware. Such indemnity
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of an Indemnified Party (as defined in Section 2.6(c)) and shall
survive any resales or dispositions of Registrable Securities by the Holders.

(b) Each Holder shall, notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors, officers, agents and employees, any underwriter of
Registrable Securities and each Person who controls the Company or any
underwriter (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and
Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents or
employees of such controlling Persons, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, from and against all Losses, as incurred, arising out of or
are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or any form of
prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus, preliminary
prospectus or any form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading (i) to the extent,
but only to the extent that, such untrue statements or omissions are based
solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the
Company by such Holder expressly for use therein or (ii) to the extent that
such information relates to such Holder or such Holders proposed method of
distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and approved by such
Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (it being understood
that the Holder has approved _Annex I_ hereto for this purpose), such
Prospectus or such form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
thereto. In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be
greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such
Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification obligation.

 



12 (c) If any Legal Proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any Person
entitled to indemnity hereunder (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Person from whom indemnity is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including the employment
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of
all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof;
_provided_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to promptly give
written notice to the Indemnifying Party after commencement of any Legal
Proceeding shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or
liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that
it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which
determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure
shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party, but the failure to so deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party
otherwise than under this Section 2.6.

 

An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such Legal Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party
or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay
such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly
to assume the defense of such Legal Proceeding and to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Legal
Proceeding; or (3) such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel
that an actual or potential conflict of interest exists if the same counsel
were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or any
other Indemnified Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the
Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party); _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
of attorneys (in addition to not more than one local counsel that may be
required in the opinion of such firm) at any time for all Indemnified
Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any
such Legal Proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. No Indemnifying
Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
effect any settlement of any pending Legal Proceeding in respect of which any
Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the
subject matter of such Legal Proceeding and does not include an admission of
fault or any wrong doing by the Indemnified Party.

 

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, all fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the
extent incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to
defend such Legal Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section)
shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within twenty (20)
Business Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_
, that the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
for that portion of such fees and expenses applicable to such actions for
which such Indemnified Party is finally judicially determined to not be
entitled to indemnification hereunder).

(d) If a claim for indemnification under Section 2.6(a) or 2.6(b) is
unavailable to an Indemnified Party (by reason of public policy or otherwise),
then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as
a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection
with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or

 



13  omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by,
or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified
Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The
amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, any
reasonable attorneys or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such
party in connection with any Legal Proceeding to the extent such party would
have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the
indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in
accordance with its terms.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 2.6(d) were determined by _pro rata_
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.6(d), (A) no
Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess
of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by such Holder
from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the Legal Proceeding
exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required
to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission and (B) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

(e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 2.6
are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to
the Indemnified Parties.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification and contribution contained in any underwriting agreement
entered into in connection with any Permitted Underwritten Offering pursuant
to Section 2.1(f) are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the
provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control.

(g) The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.6 shall
survive the completion of any resales or dispositions of Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement under this Section 2 and
otherwise.

2.7 _Rule 144_. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits
of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time
permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without
registration, the Company agrees, for a period of three (3) years following
the Closing Date, to:

(a) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act or, if
the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, make and keep current public information available,
as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, in each case, at all
times on and after the date hereof; and

(b) furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable
Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company that
it has complied with the reporting requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act or, if the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, that adequate current public
information with respect to the Company is available as required by Rule 144,
(ii) if requested by the Companys registrar and transfer agent for the
Ordinary Shares or any broker dealer that is selling the Registrable
Securities on behalf of any Holder, an opinion of counsel, reasonably
acceptable to the registrar and transfer agent and/or such broker dealer, to
the effect that the sale is being made in accordance with Rule 144 (
_provided_

 



14   _that_ the Holder provides the Company with reasonable assurances (in the
form of seller and broker representation letters) that the securities may be
sold pursuant to such rule) and (iii) such other information of the Company
as may be reasonably requested to avail any Holder of any rule or regulation
of the SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without
registration.

 

2.8 _Termination of Registration Rights_. The registration rights provided to
each Holder under this Section 2 shall terminate upon the earlier to occur
of: (a) the date that is (i) two (2) years and six (6) months following the
first date on which the Registration Statement registering all of such
Holders Registrable Securities outstanding on the Closing Date (or the
remainder of such Holders Registrable Securities outstanding on the Closing
Date in the event that such Registrable Securities are registered on more than
one Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.1(a)) became or was declared
effective under the Securities Act _plus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of all
Suspension Periods (excluding any Suspension Period caused by a Holder POSAM);
or (b) such time as there are no Registrable Securities outstanding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Sections 2.6, 2.7 and 3 shall survive the
termination of such registration rights and (ii) Section 2.4(b) shall survive
until the date that is two (2) years and six (6) months from the date of this
Agreement at which time Section 2.4(b) shall terminate.

3 _Miscellaneous_.

 

3.1 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of each of the parties
and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement. The Company may not assign its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Majority Holders (other than by merger or consolidation or to an entity which
acquires the Company, including by way of acquiring all or substantially all
of the voting power or assets of the Company, _provided_ that the successor or
acquiring Person agrees in writing to assume all of the Companys rights and
obligations under this Agreement). The rights of any Holder hereunder,
including the right to have the Company register Registrable Securities
pursuant to this Agreement, may be assigned following the Closing (but only
with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of such
Registrable Securities, _provided_ : (a) the Company is, within a reasonable
time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and
address of such transferee or assignee and the Shares with respect to which
such registration rights are being assigned and (b) such transferee or
assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

3.2 _Amendments and Waivers_. The provisions of this Agreement may not be
amended, modified, supplemented or waived unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Company and the Majority Holders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with
respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of some Holders
and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders
may be given by all Holders to which such waiver or consent relates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this sentence may not be
amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of
the first sentence of this Section 3.2. Each Holder acknowledges that the
Majority Holders have the power to bind all of the Holders.

 

3.3 _Governing Law_. All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
New York, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each
party hereto hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and
consents to process being served in any such Legal Proceeding by mailing a
copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with
evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it
under this 

 



15  Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient
service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted
by law.

3.4 _Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each of
the parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any
signature is delivered by facsimile transmission, or by e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding
obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is
executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof.

 

3.5 _Construction_. The headings herein are for convenience only, do not
constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
affect any of the provisions hereof. The language used in this Agreement will
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party.

 

3.6 _Notices_. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing and shall
be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (a) the date of transmission,
if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile (provided the
sender receives a machine-generated confirmation of successful transmission)
prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on a Business Day, except in the event that
the recipient is located outside the United States, in which case notice shall
be deemed given and effective on the next Business Day after the date
of transmission, (b) the next Business Day after the date of transmission, if
such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile on a day that is not a
Business Day or later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on any Business Day, (c)
the Business Day following the date of mailing, if sent by U.S. nationally
recognized overnight courier service with next day delivery specified, or in
the event the recipient is located outside the United States, five (5)
Business Days following the date of mailing, if sent by internationally-
recognized overnight delivery service, or (d) upon actual receipt by the party
to whom such notice is required to be given. The address and facsimile numbers
for such notices and communications shall be as follows:

To the Company (prior to the Closing):

 

Vidara Therapeutics International Ltd.

 

[]

 

Telephone: []

 

Facsimile No.: []

 

Attention: []

 

or at such other address and facsimile number as shall be specified by notice
to the Holders given in accordance with this Section 3.6. 

To the Company (after the Closing):

[]

Telephone: []

 

Facsimile No.: []

16 To the Holders:

 

At the respective addresses and facsimile numbers set forth on the signature
pages attached hereto (or at such other addresses and facsimile numbers as
shall be specified by notice to the Company given in accordance with this
Section 3.6).

3.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final
expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive
statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect
of the subject matter contained herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject
matter hereof.

3.8  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid
or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a
valid and enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor, and
upon so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in this
Agreement.

 

3.9 _Adjustments in Share Numbers_. In the event of any stock split,
subdivision, combination or other similar recapitalization or event occurring
after the date hereof, each reference in this Agreement to a number of
Ordinary Shares shall be deemed to be amended to appropriately account for
such event.

 

3.10 _Remedies_. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder of any
of their obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company, as the
case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by
law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company and
each Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate
compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the
provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of
any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

We are registering the ordinary shares issued to the selling shareholders to

proceeds from the sale by the selling shareholders of the ordinary shares. We
will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the
ordinary shares.

 

Each selling shareholder of the ordinary shares and any of their pledgees,
assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all
of their ordinary shares covered hereby on The NASDAQ Global Market or any
other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are
traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed prices, at
prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices
determined at the time of sale, or negotiated prices. A selling shareholder
may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:

 



     |  |  | ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which
the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | an underwritten public offering in which one or more
underwriters participate; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to
sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as
principal to facilitate the transaction;  
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by
the broker-dealer for its account; 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of
the applicable exchange; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | privately negotiated transactions;

the selling shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a
stipulated price per share;

     |  |  | put or call options transactions or through the writing
or settlement of standardized or over-the-counter options or other hedging or

     |  |  | by pledge to secure debts and other obligations; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | a combination of any such methods of sale; or 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. 
---|---|---|--- 

To the extent required by law, this prospectus may be amended or supplemented
from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution, which amended
or supplemented prospectus may include the following information to the extent
required by law:

 



     |  |  | the terms of the offering; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | the names of any underwriters or agents; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | the purchase price of the ordinary shares; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | any delayed delivery arrangements; 
---|---|---|--- constituting underwriters compensation; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | any initial public offering price; and 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid
to dealers. 
---|---|---|--- 

The selling shareholders may also sell ordinary shares under Rule 144 under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, if available,
rather than under this prospectus.

 

If underwriters are used in the sale, the ordinary shares will be acquired by
the underwriters for their own account and may be resold from time to time in
one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed public
offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. In
connection with any such underwritten sale of ordinary shares, underwriters
may receive compensation from the selling shareholders, for whom they may act
as agents, in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions. If the
selling shareholders use an underwriter or underwriters to effectuate the sale
of ordinary shares, we and/or they will execute an underwriting agreement
with those underwriters at the time of sale of those ordinary shares. To the
extent required by law, the names of the underwriters will be set forth in a
supplement to this prospectus or, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment
to the registration statement that includes this prospectus, used by the
underwriters to sell those securities. The obligations of the underwriters to
purchase those ordinary shares will be subject to certain conditions
precedent, and unless otherwise specified in a prospectus or a prospectus
supplement, the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the ordinary
shares offered by such prospectus or prospectus supplement if any of such
ordinary shares are purchased. Any initial public offering price and any
discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may be
changed from time to time.

 

Broker-dealers engaged by the selling shareholders may arrange for other
brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive
commissions or discounts from the selling shareholders (or, if any broker-
dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in
amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this
prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary
brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a
principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440-1.

 

From time to time, one or more of the selling shareholders may pledge,
hypothecate or grant a security interest in some or all of the
ordinary shares owned by them. The pledgees, secured parties, or persons to
whom the shares have been hypothecated will, upon foreclosure, be deemed to be
selling shareholders. The number of a selling shareholders ordinary shares
offered under this prospectus will decrease as and when it takes such
actions. The plan of distribution for that selling shareholders ordinary
shares will otherwise remain unchanged.

 

In connection with the sale of the ordinary shares or interests therein, the
selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers
or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of
the ordinary shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The
selling shareholders may also sell the ordinary shares short and deliver
these securities to close out their short positions or to return borrowed
shares in connection with such short sales, or loan or pledge the ordinary
shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling
shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-
dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative
securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial
institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-
dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus
(as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the selling shareholders have been advised that they may not use
shares registered on this registration statement to cover short sales of our
ordinary shares made prior to the date the registration statement, of which
this prospectus forms a part, has been declared effective by the SEC. The selling shareholders may also sell ordinary shares from time to time
through agents. We will name any agent involved in the offer or sale of such
shares and will list commissions payable to these agents in a prospectus
supplement, if required. These agents will be acting on a best efforts basis
to solicit purchases for the period of their appointment, unless we state
otherwise in any required prospectus supplement.

The selling shareholders may sell ordinary shares directly to purchasers. In
this case, they may not engage underwriters or agents in the offer and sale of
such shares.

A selling shareholder that is an entity may elect to make a pro rata in-kind
distribution of the ordinary shares to its members, partners or shareholders.
In such event we may file a prospectus supplement to the extent required by
law in order to permit the distributees to use the prospectus to resell the
ordinary shares acquired in the distribution. A selling shareholder which is
an individual may make gifts of ordinary shares covered hereby. Such donees
may use the prospectus to resell the shares or, if required by law, we may
file a prospectus supplement naming such donees.

The selling shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are
involved in selling the ordinary shares may be deemed to be "underwriters"
within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In
such event, any discounts, commissions or concessions received by such broker-
dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by
them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the
Securities Act. Selling shareholders who are "underwriters" within the meaning
of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to the prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act and may be subject to certain
statutory liabilities of, including but not limited to, Sections 11, 12 and 17
of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Each selling shareholder has informed
us that it is not a registered broker-dealer and does not have any written or
oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to
distribute the ordinary shares. In no event shall any underwriter or broker-
dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would
exceed eight percent (8%).

 

We are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to
the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the selling
shareholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, and the selling shareholders
may be entitled to contribution. We may be indemnified by the selling
shareholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, that may arise from any
written information furnished to us by the selling shareholders specifically
for use in this prospectus, or we may be entitled to contribution.

The selling shareholders will be subject to the prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder unless an
exemption therefrom is available.

We agreed to use our reasonable best efforts keep the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part effective until the earlier of
(i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the selling shareholders
without registration and without regard to any volume restrictions by reason
of under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar
effect, (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or
Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (iii)
two years from the date the registration statement of which this prospectus
is a part was declared effective by the SEC, provided that such two year
period is subject to extension for the number of days that the effectiveness
of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part is
suspended. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed
brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In
addition, in certain states, the resale of ordinary shares covered hereby may
not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the
applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification
requirement is available and is complied with. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person
engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously
engage in market making activities with respect to the ordinary shares for the
applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the
commencement of the distribution. In addition, the selling shareholders will
be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of
purchases and sales of ordinary shares by the selling shareholders or any
other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling
shareholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this
prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale
(including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).

There can be no assurance that any selling shareholder will sell any or all of
the ordinary shares registered pursuant to the registration statement, of
which this prospectus forms a part. In addition, there can be no assurances
that any selling shareholder will not transfer, devise or gift the ordinary
shares by other means not described in this prospectus.

Once sold under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a
part, the ordinary shares will be freely tradable in the hands of persons
other than our affiliates. _Annex II_

Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (" _CDI_ ") of the staff of the
Division of Corporation Finance (with respect to Securities Act Sections)
regarding short selling: 

_"_ _239.10_ _An issuer filed a Form S-3 registration statement for a
secondary offering of common stock which is not yet effective. One of the
selling shareholders wanted to do a short sale of common stock "against the
box" and cover the short sale with registered shares after the effective date.
The issuer was advised that the short sale could not be made before the
registration statement becomes effective, because the shares underlying the
short sale are deemed to be sold at the time such sale is made. There would,
therefore, be a violation of Section 5 if the shares were effectively sold
prior to the effective date. [Nov. 26, 2008]" _

By returning this Questionnaire, the undersigned will be deemed to be aware of
the foregoing CDI. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, by authority duly given, has caused this
Notice and Questionnaire to be executed and delivered either in person or by
its duly authorized agent.

Temporary Escrow Agreement _TEMPORARY ESCROW AGREEMENT_

 

THIS TEMPORARY ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of [ ], 2014, by and among Hamilton Therapeutics Holdings
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Holdings_ "), Horizon Pharma,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ " and, together with Holdings,
sometimes referred to individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_ ", and together with the Escrow Agent, the " _Agreement Parties_
"), and Citibank, National Association, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_
"). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to
them in that certain Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
March 18, 2014 (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Holdings, Hamilton Therapeutics
International LTD., an Irish private limited company, Buyer and the
other parties signatory thereto.

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the deposit by Buyer with the Escrow Agent of $2,750,000 (the "
_Temporary Escrow Amount_ ") in order to provide a source of funding as
described in _Section 2.11 _of the Merger Agreement. The Parties wish such
deposit to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the
Merger Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. _Appointment_. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their
escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby
accepts such appointment and agrees to act as escrow agent in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 

2\. _Escrow Fund_.

(a) Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer is
depositing with the Escrow Agent the Temporary Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent
hereby acknowledges receipt of the Temporary Escrow Amount and shall hold the
Temporary Escrow Amount, together with all products and proceeds thereof,
including all interest, dividends, gains and other income (collectively, the "
_Escrow Earnings_ ") earned with respect thereto (collectively, the " _Escrow
Fund_ ") in a separate and distinct account, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

(b) For greater certainty, all Escrow Earnings shall be retained by the
Escrow Agent and reinvested in the Escrow Fund and shall become part of the
Escrow Fund; and shall be disbursed as part of the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

3\. _Investment of Escrow Fund_. During the term of this Agreement, the Escrow
Fund shall be invested, as directed in writing by the Parties, in one or more
of the following: (a) obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof; (b) certificates of deposit
or interest-bearing accounts of national banks rated with a bond rating of A+
or better; and (c) shares of a money market fund investing only in short-
term U.S. Treasury obligations or obligations backed by short-term U.S.
Treasury obligations, including, without limitation, any money market mutual
fund, unless otherwise 

 



1  instructed jointly in writing by the Parties and as shall be acceptable to
the Escrow Agent, acting reasonably. Such joint written instructions, if any,
referred to in the foregoing sentence shall specify the type and identity of
the investments to be purchased and/or sold. With respect to any such written
instructions, the Escrow Agent will endeavor to comply with such instructions
as soon as reasonably practicable. Subject to receipt of joint written
instructions as referred to above, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to
execute purchases and sales of those investments identified in the applicable
joint instructions through the facilities of its own trading or
capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. In the absence
of such joint written direction to the contrary, the Temporary Escrow Amount
shall be invested in the Citibank Market Deposit Account (the " _MDA_ "), an
interest bearing deposit obligation of Citibank, N.A., or, if not available,
such similar or successor account offered by the Escrow Agent (the MDA
together with the investments described in clause (a), (b) and (c) of this
_Section 3_, collectively, the " _Permitted Investments_ "). The Parties
understand that amounts on deposit in the MDA are insured up to a total of
$250,000, per depositor, per insured bank (including principal and accrued
interest) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ "),
subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the FDIC. The Parties
understand that deposits in the MDA in excess of such FDIC insured amount are
not secured. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any
investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required payments
under this Agreement. The Parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent
will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either
the investment of the Escrow Fund or the purchase, sale, retention or other
disposition of any investment described herein. The Escrow Agent shall not
have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment
made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any
liquidation of any investment made prior to its maturity under the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or for the failure of the Parties to give the
Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow Fund. The Escrow
Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation from third parties
with respect to any investment directed hereunder; provided that the foregoing
shall not limit the Escrow Agents liability for its bad faith, willful
misconduct or gross negligence. Except as expressly provided herein, the
Escrow Fund shall not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, be assigned,
hypothecated, pledged, alienated, released from escrow or transferred
within escrow (or otherwise dealt with in any manner which has the economic
effect of any of the foregoing acts, on a current or prospective basis).

 

The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest the property
held in escrow pursuant to the terms hereof until the following Business Day
if all or a portion of such property is deposited with the Escrow Agent after
12:00 PM Eastern Time on the day of deposit. Instructions to invest or
reinvest funds that are received after 12:00 PM Eastern Time will be treated
as if received on the following Business Day. The Escrow Agent shall have the
power to sell or liquidate the foregoing investments whenever the Escrow Agent
shall be required to distribute amounts from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. Requests or instructions received after 12:00 PM
Eastern Time by the Escrow Agent to liquidate all or any portion of the Escrow
Fund will be treated as if received on the following Business Day. The Escrow
Agent shall have no responsibility for any investment losses resulting from
the investment, reinvestment or liquidation of the Escrow Fund, as applicable,
provided that the Escrow Agent has made such investment, reinvestment or
liquidation of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms, and subject to
the conditions, of this Agreement and the foregoing shall not limit the Escrow
Agents liability for its bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence.

 



2 The Parties to this Agreement acknowledge that non-deposit investment
products are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, Citibank/Citigroup or any
of its affiliates, are not FDIC insured and are subject to investment risks,
including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Only deposits in
the United States (e.g., the MDA) are subject to FDIC insurance.

The Escrow Agent is authorized, for any securities at any time held
hereunder, to register such securities in the name of its nominee(s) or the
nominees of any securities depository, and such nominee(s) may sign the name
of any of the Parties hereto to whom or to which such securities belong and
guarantee such signature in order to transfer securities or certify ownership
thereof to tax or other Governmental Entities.

 

The Escrow Agent shall send an account statement to each of the Parties on a
monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Account for the preceding
month. Although Buyer and Holdings each recognize that it may obtain a broker
confirmation or written statement containing comparable information at no
additional cost, Buyer and Holdings hereby agree that confirmations of
Permitted Investments are not required to be issued by the Escrow Agent for
each month in which a monthly statement is rendered. No statement need be
rendered for the Escrow Account if no activity occurred for such month.

 

The delivery of the Escrow Fund is subject to the sale and final settlement of
Permitted Investments. Proceeds of a sale of Permitted Investments will be
delivered on the Business Day on which the appropriate instructions are
delivered to the Escrow Agent if received prior to the deadline for same day
sale of such Permitted Investments. If such instructions are received after
the applicable deadline, proceeds will be delivered on the next succeeding
Business Day.

4\. _Disposition and Termination of the Escrow Fund_.

(a) _Disposition of Escrow Fund_. Upon receipt of a Joint Release Instruction
with respect to the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, but in any
event within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such Joint Release

with such Joint Release Instruction. If at any time either of the Parties
receives a Final Determination, then upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a
copy of such Final Determination from any Party, the Escrow Agent shall (A)
promptly deliver a copy of such Final Determination to the other Party
and (B) on the fifth (5th) Business Day following receipt by the applicable
Party from the Escrow Agent of the Final Determination, disburse to Buyer

Temporary Escrow Amount (but only to the extent funds are available in the
Escrow Fund) in accordance with such Final Determination. Subject to the terms
of this _Section 4(a)_, the Escrow Agent will act on such Final Determination
without further inquiry. 

(b) _Termination_. Except as provided in _Section 8_, this Agreement and the
escrow arrangements contemplated by this Agreement shall terminate on the
earliest to occur of (i) the date that the Escrow Fund is fully and finally
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) the
delivery to the Escrow Agent of a written notice of termination executed
jointly by Buyer and Holdings (such notice, the " _Termination Notice_ ").

 



3 (c) _Disbursement Logistics_.

4(a)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds or

Determination, as applicable, or (y) _Section 4(b)(ii)_ shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds or cashiers check as set forth
in the Termination Notice.

(ii) In the event a Joint Release Instruction or a Termination Notice is
delivered to the Escrow Agent, whether in writing, by telecopier or
otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such
instruction by telephone call back to the person or persons designated in
_Exhibits  A-1_ and _A-2_ annexed hereto (the " _Call Back Authorized
Individuals_ "), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of
anyone purporting to be a Call Back Authorized Individual. To assure accuracy
of the instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may record such call backs.
If the Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instructions, or is not satisfied
with the verification it receives, it will not execute the instruction until
all such issues have been resolved. The persons and telephone numbers for call
backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the
Escrow Agent.

 

(iii) Whenever the Escrow Agent pays all or any portion of the Temporary
Escrow Amount pursuant to a Joint Release Instruction, Final Determination
and/or Termination Notice, the Escrow Agent shall also pay therewith, as
applicable, all Escrow Earnings earned through the date of payment on the
underlying amount of the Temporary Escrow Amount being paid as set forth in
such Joint Release Instruction, Final Determination and/or Termination
Notice.

(v) " _Person_ " means an individual, a partnership, a corporation, a limited
liability company, an association, firm, a joint stock company, a trust, a
joint venture, an unincorporated organization or a Governmental Entity or
other entity.

5\. _Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties
as are expressly set forth herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be
responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements
to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or
document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any, including
without limitation the Merger Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be
required to determine if any Person has complied with any such agreements, nor
shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the
terms of such agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for
acting or refraining from acting upon any Joint Release Instruction furnished
to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed and
presented by the proper Party or Parties. Concurrent with the execution of
this Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized
signers forms in the form of _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ attached hereto.
The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the
validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or
request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which
may be due to the Escrow Fund. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be
uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions,
claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with
any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from
taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely the Escrow
Fund until it shall be directed otherwise in a Final Determination.
The Escrow Agent may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court
of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to
certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all
liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any
action or non-action based on such declaratory judgment. The Escrow Agent may
consult with legal counsel of its selection in the event of any dispute or
question as to the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof or
its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability or obligation
with respect to the Escrow Fund except for the Escrow Agents bad faith,
willful misconduct or gross negligence. To the extent practicable, the
Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute
(other than with respect to a dispute involving the Escrow Agent) without
making the Escrow Agent a party to the same. Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable,
directly or indirectly, for any (a) damages, losses or expenses arising out of
the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or expenses which
result from the Escrow Agents bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct, or (b) special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any
kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), other than in
connection with the Escrow Agents bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct, even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of
such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 



5 6\. _Resignation and Removal of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent (a) may resign
and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty
(30) calendar days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the
Parties specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect or (b) may
be removed, with or without cause, by Buyer and Holdings acting jointly at
any time by providing written notice to the Escrow Agent. Any corporation or
association into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all
or substantially all of the escrow business of the Escrow Agents corporate
trust line of business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under
this Agreement without further act. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility
after such thirty (30) day notice period expires or after receipt of written
notice of removal shall be to hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund (without any
obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same (i) to a substitute
or successor escrow agent pursuant to a joint written designation from the
Parties, (ii) as set forth in a Joint Release Instruction or (iii) in
accordance with the directions of a Final Determination, at which time of
delivery Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. In
the event the Escrow Agent resigns, if the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar
days following receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of such a
successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting
appointment shall be binding upon all of the Parties hereto.

7\. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent are
described in  _Schedule 1_ attached hereto and shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) by Holdings and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

8.  _Indemnity_. Each of the Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their
respective successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents and employees
(the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings,
litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including the reasonable fees
and expenses of in house or one outside counsel and experts and their staffs
and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively
" _Escrow Agent Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with (a) the
Escrow Agents execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting or
withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection
with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error
of the Indemnitee, except to the extent that such Escrow Agent Losses have
been caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Escrow Agent or any such Indemnitee, or (b) its following any instructions or
other directions from Buyer or Holdings, except to the extent that its
following any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the
terms hereof. The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the
termination of this Agreement. The Parties hereby grant the Escrow Agent a
lien on, right of set-off against and security interest in, the Escrow Fund
for the payment of any reasonable claim for indemnification, expenses and
amounts due hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Escrow Agent is
expressly authorized and directed, but shall not be obligated, upon prior
written notice to the Parties, to charge against and withdraw from the Escrow
Fund for its own account or for the account of an Indemnitee any amounts due
to the Escrow Agent or to an Indemnitee under this _Section 8_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer 

 



6  and Holdings agree, solely as between themselves, that any obligation for
indemnification under this _Section 8_ (or for reasonable fees and expenses
of the Escrow Agent described in  _Section 7_) shall be borne by the Party
or Parties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be responsible
for causing the loss, damage, liability, cost or expense against which the
Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if no such determination is
made, then one-half by Buyer and one-half by Holdings. The provisions of this
_Section 8_ shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and
the termination of this Agreement.

9\. _Tax Matters._

 

(a) Upon execution of this Agreement, each Party shall provide the Escrow
Agent with a fully executed Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-8,
W-9 and/or other required documentation, as applicable, which shall include
the Partys taxpayer identification number assigned by the IRS. Unless
otherwise directed in a joint written instruction executed by Holdings and
Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall report to the IRS and as appropriate withhold
and remit taxes to the IRS or to any other taxing authority as required
by applicable law based upon the information or documentation so provided.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on such information and
documentation and shall not be responsible for and shall be indemnified by
Holdings and Buyer, severally and not jointly, for any additional tax,
interest or penalty arising from the inaccuracy or late receipt of such
information or documentation. Buyer and Holdings shall each be responsible for
fifty percent (50%) of any such indemnification obligation arising under this
_Section 9_.

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges that, for U.S. federal and state income tax
purposes, any Escrow Earnings shall be income of Buyer, whether or not the
income has been disbursed by the Escrow Agent during a particular year and to
the extent required under the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). The Escrow Agent shall be
responsible for reporting any Escrow Earnings to the IRS; _provided_ that the
Parties acknowledge that payments of any Escrow Earnings will be subject to
backup withholding penalties unless a properly completed IRS form W-8 or W-9
certification is submitted to the Escrow Agent by Buyer. The Escrow Agent
shall have no obligation to pay any taxes or estimated taxes.

(c) Subject to the provisions of _Section 9(d)_, Buyer is required to prepare
and file with the IRS to the extent required under the provisions of the Code
and all required state and local departments of revenue any and all income or
other tax returns applicable to the Escrow Fund.

 

(d) The Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes required to be withheld by
applicable law, including but not limited to required withholding in the
absence of proper tax documentation, and shall remit such taxes to the
appropriate authorities.

10\. _Covenant of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees and covenants
with Buyer and Holdings that it shall perform all of its obligations under
this Agreement and shall not deliver custody or possession of any of the
Escrow Fund to anyone except pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement
or as otherwise required by law.

12\. _Miscellaneous._ This Agreement, together with the Merger Agreement
(other than with respect to the Escrow Agent) constitutes the entire agreement
among the Agreement Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and is not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. The
provisions of this Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented,
in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by all of the Agreement
Parties. Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be
assigned in whole or in part by any Agreement Party, except as provided in
_Sections 6_ and _15_ , without the prior consent of the other Agreement
Parties. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Each Agreement Party irrevocably waives any objection
on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and
irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner
permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts
located in the State of Delaware. The Agreement Parties hereby waive any
right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding
arising or relating to this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of
the Agreement Parties may be transmitted by facsimile or electronic
transmission in portable document format (.pdf), and such facsimile or .pdf
will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such
Agreement Party whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such
Agreement Party. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be
prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any applicable law of a
jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the 

 



9  remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability
in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provisions in any other jurisdiction. The Parties represent, warrant and
covenant that each document, notice, instruction or request provided by such
Party to the Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any such applicable law may be
waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the Parties hereto to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this Agreement shall be
enforced as written. Except as expressly provided in _Section 8_, any and all
remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other legal or equitable remedy conferred hereby and the
exercise by any Party of one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of
another. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 

13\. _Compliance with Court Orders_. In the event that any portion of the
Escrow Fund shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order,
or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or
any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the Escrow Fund deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent
is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply
with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with
any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties
hereto or to any other Person, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding
such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside or vacated.

14\. _Further Assurances_. Following the date hereof, each Agreement Party
shall deliver to the other Agreement Parties such further information and
documents and shall execute and deliver to the other Agreement Parties such
further instruments and agreements as any other Agreement Party shall
reasonably request to consummate or confirm the transactions provided for
herein, to accomplish the purpose hereof or to assure to any other Agreement
Party the benefits hereof.

 

15\. _Assignment_. No assignment of the interest of any of the Parties shall
be binding upon the Escrow Agent unless and until written notice of such
assignment shall be filed with and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent.

16\. _Force Majeure_. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not
performing any act or fulfilling any obligation hereunder by reason of any
occurrence beyond its control (including, but not limited to, any provision of
any present or future law or regulation or any act of any Governmental
Entity, any act of God or war or terrorism, or the unavailability of the
Federal Reserve Bank wire services or any electronic communication facility).

 

17\. _Use of Citibank Name._ No publicly distributed printed or other material
in any language, including prospectuses, notices, reports, and promotional
material which mentions "Citibank" by name or the rights, powers, or duties of
the Escrow Agent under this Agreement shall be issued by any of the Parties

Escrow Agent.

effective (the "Effective Time"), will be allotted and issued by the Company
to an exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") who shall hold such ordinary
shares in trust for the holders of shares of common stock of Horizon Pharma,
Inc. (the "Merger Consideration"). As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Horizon Common Stock
(the "Horizon Certificates") and each holder of record of a non-certificated
outstanding share of Horizon Common Stock represented by book entry ("Horizon
Book Entry Shares"), which at the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title
to the Horizon Certificates and Horizon Book Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Horizon Certificates or Horizon Book Entry Shares
(as applicable) to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Horizon Pharma, Inc.), and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Horizon Certificates and Horizon Book
Entry Shares in exchange for 

---|--- 
 



5 of Horizon Certificates or Horizon Book Entry Shares (as applicable) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Horizon Certificates or Horizon Book
Entry Shares (as applicable) shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor that number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (after
taking into account all Horiozon Certificates or Horizon Book Entry Shares (as
applicable) surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
(which may be in uncertificated form), and the Horizon Certificates or Horizon
Book Entry Shares (as applicable) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Horizon Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of Buyer, the proper number of
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company may be transferred to a person
other than the person in whose name the Horizon Certificate or Horizon Book
Entry Shares (as applicable) so surrendered is registered, if such Horizon
Certificate or Horizon Book Entry Shares (as applicable) shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such transfer shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company to a person other
than the registered holder of such Horizon Certificate or Horizon Book Entry
Shares (as applicable) or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Horizon
Pharma, Inc. that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Any portion of
the Merger Consideration which has not been transferred to the holders of
Horizon Certificates or Horizon Book Entry Shares (as applicable) as of the
one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company
or its designee, upon demand, and the ordinary shares in the capital of the
Company included therein shall be sold at the best price reasonably
obtainable at that time. Any holder of Horizon Certificates or Horizon Book
Entry Shares (as applicable) who has not complied with this Article 12 prior
to the one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter look only
to the Company for payment of such holders claim for the Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
applicable laws).

receive any dividend or distribution and shall not be entitled to receive
notice of, nor to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company.
On a return of assets, whether on liquidation or otherwise, the deferred
shares shall entitle the holder thereof only to the repayment of the amounts
paid up on such shares after repayment of the capital paid up on the ordinary
shares plus the payment of $5,000,000 on each of the ordinary shares and the
holders of the deferred shares (as such) shall not be entitled to any further
participation in the assets or profits of the Company. 
---|--- 
 



   14. | The special resolution passed on the Adoption Date adopting these
Articles shall be deemed to confer irrevocable authority on the Company at any

an agreement to transfer the same otherwise than for valuable consideration to
the Company or to such other person as the Company may nominate;

shares as aforesaid, cancel such shares (except those which, or any interest
of the Company in which, it shall have previously disposed of) and reduce the
amount of the share capital by the nominal value of the shares so cancelled
and the Directors may take such steps as are requisite to enable the Company
to carry out its obligations under that subsection without complying with
Sections 72 and 73 of the 1963 Act including passing resolutions in accordance
with Section 43(5) of the 1983 Act. 
---|--- 
 



   16. | Neither the acquisition by the Company otherwise than for
valuable consideration of all or any of the deferred shares nor the redemption
thereof nor the cancellation thereof by the Company in accordance with
this Article shall constitute a variation or abrogation of the rights or
privileges attached to the deferred shares, and accordingly the deferred
shares or any of them may be so acquired, redeemed and cancelled without any
such consent or sanction on the part of the holders thereof. The rights
conferred upon the holders of the deferred shares shall not be deemed to be

of defacement or wearing out, upon delivery of the old certificate.

7 REGISTER OF MEMBERS

 



   21. | The Company shall maintain or cause to be maintained a Register
of its Members in accordance with the Companies Acts. 
---|--- 



   22. | If the Board considers it necessary or appropriate, the Company
may establish and maintain a duplicate Register or Registers of Members at
such location or locations within or outside Ireland as the Board thinks
fit. The original Register of Members shall be treated as the Register of
Members for the purposes of these Articles and the Companies Acts. 
---|--- 



   23. | The Company, or any agent(s) appointed by it to maintain the
duplicate Register of Members in accordance with these Articles, shall as soon
as practicable and on a regular basis record or procure the recording in
the original Register of Members all transfers of Shares effected on any
duplicate Register of Members and shall at all times maintain the original
Register of Members in such manner as to show at all times the Members for the
time being and the Shares respectively held by them, in all respects in
accordance with the Companies Acts. 
---|--- 



   24. | The Company shall not be bound to register more than four persons
as joint holders of any Share. If any Share shall stand in the names of two or
more persons, the person first named in the Register of Members shall
be deemed the sole holder thereof as regards service of notices and, subject
to the provisions of these Articles, all or any other matters connected with
the Company. 
---|--- 
 

TRANSFER OF SHARES



   25. | All transfers of Shares shall be effected by an instrument of
transfer in such form as the Board may approve. All instruments of transfer
must be left at the registered office or at such other place as the Board
may appoint and all such instruments of transfer shall be retained by the
Company. 
---|--- 



   26. | 
---|--- 



     | 26.1 | The instrument of transfer shall be executed by or on
behalf of the transferor. The instrument of transfer of any Share shall be in
writing and shall be executed with a manual signature or facsimile signature
(which may be machine imprinted or otherwise) by or on behalf of the
transferor provided that in the case of execution by facsimile signature by or
on behalf of a transferor, the Board shall have previously been provided with
a list of specimen signatures of the authorised signatories of such
transferor and the Board shall be reasonably satisfied that such facsimile
signature corresponds to one of those specimen signatures. The instrument of
transfer need not be signed by the transferee.  
---|---|--- 



     | 26.2 | The instrument of transfer of any Share may be executed for
and on behalf of the transferor by any Director, the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary on behalf of the Company, and the Company shall be deemed to have
been irrevocably appointed agent for the transferor of such Share or Shares
with full power to execute, complete and deliver in the name of and on behalf
of the transferor of such Share or Shares all such transfers of Shares held by
the Members in the share capital of the Company. Any document which records
the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee, the class and number
of Shares agreed to be transferred, the date of the agreement to transfer
Shares, shall, once executed by the transferor or any Director or the
Secretary or Assistant Secretary on behalf of the Company as agent for the
transferor, be deemed to be a proper instrument of transfer for the purposes
of section 81 of the 1963 Act. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the
holder of the Share until the name of the transferee is entered on the
Register in respect thereof, and neither the title of the transferee nor the
title of the transferor shall be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in
the proceedings in reference to the sale should the Directors so determine. 
---|---|--- 
 



8 the Companies Acts or any other applicable law permits, may, or may procure
that a subsidiary of the Company shall, pay Irish stamp duty arising on a
transfer of Shares on behalf of the transferee of such Shares of the Company.
If stamp duty resulting from the transfer of Shares in the Company which would
otherwise be payable by the transferee is paid by the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company on behalf of the transferee, then in those
circumstances, the Company shall, on its behalf or on behalf of its subsidiary
(as the case may be), be entitled to (i) seek reimbursement of the stamp duty
from the transferee, (ii) set-off the stamp duty against any dividends
payable to the transferee of those Shares and (iii) to claim a first and
permanent lien on the Shares on which stamp duty has been paid by the Company
or its subsidiary for the amount of stamp duty paid. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 26.4 | Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles and
subject to any regulations made under section 239 of the 1990 Act, title to
any Shares in the Company may also be evidenced and transferred without a
written instrument in accordance with section 239 of the 1990 Act or any
regulations made thereunder. The Directors shall have power to permit any
class of Shares to be held in uncertificated form and to implement any
arrangements they think fit for such evidencing and transfer which accord
with such regulations and in particular shall, where appropriate, be entitled
to disapply or modify all or part of the provisions in these Articles with
respect to the requirement for written instruments of transfer and share
certificates (if any), in order to give effect to such regulations. 
---|---|--- 



   27. | The Board may in its absolute discretion and without assigning
any reason for its decision, decline to register any transfer of any Share
which is not a fully paid Share. The Board may also, in its absolute
discretion, and without assigning any reason, refuse to register a transfer
of any Share unless: 
---|--- 



     | 27.1 | the instrument of transfer is fully and properly completed
and lodged with the Company accompanied by the certificate for the Shares (if
any) to which it relates (which shall upon registration of the transfer
be cancelled) and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to
show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; 
---|---|--- 



     | 27.2 | the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class
of Shares; 
---|---|--- 



     | 27.3 | a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933
of the United States of America is in effect with respect to such transfer or
such transfer is exempt from registration and, if requested by the Board, a
written opinion from counsel reasonably acceptable to the Board is obtained
to the effect that such transfer is exempt from registration; 
---|---|--- 



     | 27.4 | the instrument of transfer is properly stamped (in
circumstances where stamping is required). For the purposes of these Articles,
the Company is entitled to assume that the instrument of transfer is
chargeable with stamp duty unless the transferor or transferee can
demonstrate that it is not chargeable; 
---|---|--- 



     | 27.5 | in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of
joint holders to which the Share is to be transferred does not exceed four; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 27.6 | it is satisfied, acting reasonably, that all applicable
consents, authorisations, permissions or approvals of any governmental body or
agency in Ireland or any other applicable jurisdiction required to be obtained
under relevant law prior to such transfer have been obtained; and 
---|---|--- 
 



9 would not violate the terms of any agreement to which the Company (or any of
its subsidiaries) and the transferor are party or subject. 
---|---|--- 
 



   28. | If the Board shall refuse to register a transfer of any Share, it
shall, within two (2) months after the date on which the transfer was lodged
with the Company, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of
such refusal. 
---|--- 



   29. | The Company shall not be obligated to make any transfer to an
infant or to a person in respect of whom an order has been made by a competent
court or official on the grounds that she is or may be suffering from
mental disorder or is otherwise incapable of managing her affairs or under
other legal disability. 
---|--- 



   30. | Upon every transfer of Shares the certificate (if any) held by
the transferor shall be given up to be cancelled, and shall forthwith be
cancelled accordingly, and subject to Article 18 a new certificate may be
issued without charge to the transferee in respect of the Shares transferred
to her, and if any of the Shares included in the certificate so given up shall
be retained by the transferor, a new certificate in respect thereof may be
issued to her without charge. The Company shall also retain the instrument(s)
of transfer. 
---|--- 

REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF SHARES

 



   31. | The Holdings Redeemable Bonus Shares shall be redeemed for the
amount and at the time specified in, and in accordance with, the Transaction
Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   32. | Subject to the provisions of Part XI of the 1990 Act and the
other provisions of this Article 32, the Company may: 
---|--- 



     | 32.1 | pursuant to section 207 of the 1990 Act, issue any Shares
of the Company which are to be redeemed or are liable to be redeemed at the
option of the Company or the Member on such terms and in such manner as may
be determined by the Company in general meeting (by Special Resolution) on
the recommendation of the Directors; 
---|---|--- 



     | 32.2 | redeem Shares of the Company on such terms as may be
contained in, or be determined pursuant to the provisions of, these Articles.
Subject as aforesaid, the Company may cancel any Shares so redeemed or may
hold them as treasury shares and re-issue such treasury shares as Shares of
any class or classes or cancel them; 
---|---|--- 



     | 32.3 | subject to or in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Acts and without prejudice to any relevant special rights attached
to any class of shares, pursuant to section 211 of the 1990 Act, purchase any
of its own Shares (including any Redeemable Shares and without any obligation
to purchase on any _pro rata_ basis as between Members or Members of the same
class) and may cancel any shares so purchased or hold them as treasury (as
defined by section 209 of the 1990 Act) and may reissue any such shares as
shares of any class or classes or cancel them; or 
---|---|--- 



     | 32.4 | pursuant to section 210 of the 1990 Act, convert any of its
Shares into Redeemable Shares provided that the total number of Shares which
shall be redeemable pursuant to this authority shall not exceed the limit
in section 210(4) of the 1990 Act. 
---|---|--- 



   33. | The Company may make a payment in respect of the redemption or
purchase of its own Shares in any manner permitted by the Companies Acts. 
---|--- 
 



10 deliver up to the Company at its registered office or such other place as the
Board shall specify, the certificate(s) (if any) thereof for cancellation
and thereupon the Company shall pay to her the purchase or redemption monies
or consideration in respect thereof. 
---|--- 

VARIATION OF RIGHTS OF SHARES



   35. | If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into
different classes of Shares, the rights attached to any class (unless
otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be
varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of three-
quarters of all the votes of the issued Shares of that class, or with the
sanction of a Special Resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of
the Shares of that class.  
---|--- 



   36. | The provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings of
the Company shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to every such general meeting of
the holders of one class of Shares except that the necessary quorum shall be
one or more persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-half of the
issued Shares of the class. 
---|--- 



   37. | The rights conferred upon the holders of the Shares of any class
issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly
provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class, be deemed to
be varied by (i) the creation or issue of further Shares ranking _pari passu_
therewith; (ii) a purchase or redemption by the Company of its own Shares; or
(iii) the creation or issue for value (as determined by the Board) of further
Shares ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of the
Company or otherwise in priority to them. 
---|--- 
 

LIEN ON SHARES



   38. | The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share
(not being a fully paid Share) for all monies (whether presently payable or
not) payable at a fixed time or called in respect of that Share.
The Directors, at any time, may declare any Share to be wholly or in part
exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Companys lien on a Share
shall extend to all monies payable in respect of it. 
---|--- 
 



   39. | The Company may sell in such manner as the Directors determine
any Share on which the Company has a lien if a sum in respect of which the
lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within fourteen clear days
after notice demanding payment, and stating that if the notice is not
complied with the Share may be sold, has been given to the holder of the Share
or to the person entitled to it by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the
holder. 
---|--- 
 



   40. | To give effect to a sale, the Directors may authorise some person
to execute an instrument of transfer of the Share sold to, or in accordance
with the directions of, the transferee. The transferee shall be entered
in the Register as the holder of the Share comprised in any such transfer and
she shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase monies nor
shall her title to the Share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity
of the proceedings in reference to the sale, and after the name of the
transferee has been entered in the Register, the remedy of any person
aggrieved by the sale shall be in damages only and against the Company
exclusively. 
---|--- 
 



   41. | The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall
be applied in payment of so much of the sum for which the lien exists as is
presently payable and any residue (upon surrender to the Company
for cancellation of the certificate for the Shares sold and subject to a like
lien for any monies not presently payable as existed upon the Shares before
the sale) shall be paid to the person entitled to the Shares at the date of
the sale.  
---|--- 



   42. |

Whenever any law for the time being of any country, state or place imposes or
purports to impose any immediate or future or possible liability upon the
Company to make any payment or empowers any government or taxing authority or
government official to require 

---|--- 
 



11 registered in the Register as held either jointly or solely by any Members or
in respect of any dividends, bonuses or other monies due or payable or
accruing due or which may become due or payable to such Member by the Company
on or in respect of any Shares registered as mentioned above or for or on
account or in respect of any Member and whether in consequence of: 
---|--- 
 



     | 42.1 | the death of such Member; 
---|---|--- 



     | 42.2 | the non-payment of any income tax or other tax by such
Member; 
---|---|--- 



     | 42.3 | the non-payment of any estate, probate, succession, death,
stamp or other duty by the executor or administrator of such Member or by or
out of her estate; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 42.4 | any other act or thing; 
---|---|--- 

in every such case (except to the extent that the rights conferred upon
holders of any class of Shares render the Company liable to make additional
payments in respect of sums withheld on account of the foregoing):



     | 42.5 | the Company shall be fully indemnified by such Member or
her executor or administrator from all liability; 
---|---|--- 



     | 42.6 | the Company shall have a lien upon all dividends and other
monies payable in respect of the Shares registered in the Register as held
either jointly or solely by such Member for all monies paid or payable by the
Company as referred to above in respect of such Shares or in respect of any
dividends or other monies thereon or for or on account or in respect of such
Member under or in consequence of any such law, together with interest at the
rate of 15% per annum (or such other rate as the Board may determine) thereon
from the date of payment to date of repayment, and the Company may deduct or
set off against such dividends or other monies so payable any monies paid or
payable by the Company as referred to above together with interest at the
same rate; 
---|---|--- 



     | 42.7 | the Company may recover as a debt due from such Member or
her executor or administrator (wherever constituted) any monies paid by the
Company under or in consequence of any such law and interest thereon at the
rate and for the period referred to above in excess of any dividends or other
monies then due or payable by the Company; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 42.8 | the Company may if any such money is paid or payable by it
under any such law as referred to above refuse to register a transfer of any
Shares by any such Member or her executor or administrator until such money
and interest is set off or deducted as referred to above or in the case that
it exceeds the amount of any such dividends or other monies then due or
payable by the Company, until such excess is paid to the Company. 
---|---|--- 
 

Subject to the rights conferred upon the holders of any class of Shares,
nothing in this Article 42 will prejudice or affect any right or remedy which
any law may confer or purport to confer on the Company. As between the Company
and every such Member as referred to above (and, her executor, administrator
and estate, wherever constituted), any right or remedy which such law
shall confer or purport to confer on the Company shall be enforceable by the
Company.

CALLS ON SHARES

 



   43. |

Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may make calls upon the
Members in respect of any monies unpaid on their Shares and each
Member (subject to receiving at least fourteen 

---|--- 
 



12 made) shall pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on
her Shares. A call may be required to be paid by instalments. A call may be
revoked before receipt by the Company of a sum due thereunder, in whole or in
part and payment of a call may be postponed in whole or in part. 
---|--- 
 



   44. | A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the
resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 
---|--- 



   45. | A person on whom a call is made shall (in addition to a
transferee) remain liable notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the Share
in respect of which the call is made. 
---|--- 
 



   46. | The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. 
---|--- 



   47. | If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable, the
person from whom it is due and payable shall pay interest on the amount unpaid
from the day it became due until it is paid at the rate fixed by the terms of
allotment of the Share or in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed,
at the appropriate rate (as defined by the Companies Acts) but the Directors
may waive payment of the interest wholly or in part. 
---|--- 
 



   48. | An amount payable in respect of a Share on allotment or at any
fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value by way of premium, shall be
deemed to be a call and if it is not paid the provisions of these Articles
shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call. 
---|--- 



   49. | Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may make
arrangements on the issue of Shares for a difference between the holders in
the amounts and times of payment of calls on their Shares. 
---|--- 
 



   50. | The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member
willing to advance the same all or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid
upon any Shares held by her, and upon all or any of the monies so advanced
may pay (until the same would, but for such advance, become payable) interest
at such rate as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the Member paying
such sum in advance. 
---|--- 
 

FORFEITURE



   51. | If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the
day appointed for payment thereof, the Directors, at any time thereafter
during such times as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid, may
serve a notice on her requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment
as is unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued. 
---|--- 



   52. | The notice shall state a further day (not earlier than the
expiration of fourteen clear days from the date of service of the notice) on
or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall
state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed the
Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. 
---|--- 



   53. | If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not
complied with then, at any time thereafter before the payment required by the
notice has been made, any Shares in respect of which the notice has been
given may be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect. The
forfeiture shall include all dividends or other monies payable in respect of
the forfeited Shares and not paid before forfeiture. The Directors may accept
a surrender of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder. 
---|--- 



   54. |

On the trial or hearing of any action for the recovery of any money due for
any call it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the Member sued is
entered in the Register as the holder, 

---|--- 
 



13 debt accrued, that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the
minute book and that notice of such call was duly given to the Member sued,
in pursuance of these Articles, and it shall not be necessary to prove the
appointment of the Directors who made such call nor any other matters
whatsoever, but the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive
evidence of the debt. 
---|--- 



   55. | A forfeited Share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such
terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit and at any time before a
sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as
the Directors think fit. Where for the purposes of its disposal such a Share
is to be transferred to any person, the Directors may authorise some person to
execute an instrument of transfer of the Share to that person. The Company may
receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale or
disposition thereof and may execute a transfer of the Share in favour of the
person to whom the Share is sold or disposed of and thereupon she shall be
registered as the holder of the Share and shall not be bound to see to the
application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall her title to the Share be
affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to
the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the Share.  
---|--- 



   56. | A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a
Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but nevertheless shall remain
liable to pay to the Company all monies which, at the date of forfeiture,
were payable by her to the Company in respect of the Shares, without any
deduction or allowance for the value of the Shares at the time of forfeiture
but her liability shall cease if and when the Company shall have received
payment in full of all such monies in respect of the Shares. 
---|--- 



   57. | A statutory declaration or affidavit that the declarant is a
Director or the Secretary of the Company, and that a Share in the Company has
been duly forfeited on the date stated in the declaration, shall be
conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons
claiming to be entitled to the Share. 
---|--- 



   58. | The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in
the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share,
becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value
of the Share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue
of a call duly made and notified. 
---|--- 



   59. | The Directors may accept the surrender of any Share which the
Directors have resolved to have been forfeited upon such terms and conditions
as may be agreed and, subject to any such terms and conditions, a
surrendered Share shall be treated as if it has been forfeited. 
---|--- 

NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS

 



   60. | The Company shall not be obligated to recognise any person as
holding any Share upon any trust (except as is otherwise provided in these
Articles or to the extent required by law) and the Company shall not be bound
by or be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof)
any equitable, contingent, future, or partial interest in any Share, or any
interest in any fractional part of a Share, or (except only as is otherwise
provided by these Articles or the Companies Acts) any other rights in respect
of any Share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the
registered holder. This shall not preclude the Company from requiring the
Members or a transferee of Shares to furnish to the Company with information
as to the beneficial ownership of any Share when such information is
reasonably required by the Company. 
---|--- 
 

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES



   61. |

In case of the death of a Member, the survivor or survivors where the deceased
was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased
where she was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the
Company as having any title to her interest in the 

---|--- 
 



14  Shares, but nothing herein contained shall release the estate of any such
deceased holder from any liability in respect of any Shares which had been
held by her solely or jointly with other persons.



   62. | Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the
death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any other
way than by transfer) may, upon such evidence being produced as may from
time to time be required by the Board and subject as hereinafter provided,
elect either to be registered herself as holder of the Share or to make such
transfer of the Share to such other person nominated by her and to have such
person registered as the transferee thereof, but the Board shall, in either
case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would
have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by that Member before her
death or bankruptcy as the case may be.  
---|--- 



   63. | If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to be registered
herself as holder, she shall deliver or send to the Company a notice in
writing signed by her stating that she so elects. 
---|--- 
 



   64. | Subject to Article 65, a person becoming entitled to a Share by
reason of the death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of the holder
(or in any other case than by transfer) shall be entitled to the
same dividends and other advantages to which she would be entitled if she
were the registered holder of the Share, except that she shall not, before
being registered as a Member in respect of the Share, be entitled in respect
of it to exercise any right conferred by Membership in relation to meetings
of the Company provided however that the Board may at any time give notice
requiring any such person to elect either to be registered herself or to
transfer the Share and if the notice is not complied with within ninety days
the Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other
monies payable in respect of the Share until the requirements of the notice
have been complied with. 
---|--- 
 



   65. | The Board may at any time give notice requiring a person entitled
by transmission to a Share to elect either to be registered herself or to
transfer the Share and if the notice is not complied with within 60 days
the Board may withhold payment of all dividends and other monies payable in
respect of the Share until the requirements of the notice have been complied
with. 
---|---

CHANGE OF LOCATION OF REGISTERED OFFICE; AND ALTERATION OF CAPITAL

 



   66. | The Company may by Ordinary Resolution:

divided into Shares of such nominal value, as such Ordinary Resolution shall
prescribe;

     | 66.3 | consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into
Shares of larger amount than its existing Shares; 
---|---|--- 



     | 66.4 | by subdivision of its existing Shares or any of them divide
the whole or any part of its share capital into Shares of smaller nominal
value than is fixed by the Memorandum subject to section 68(1)(d) of the 1963
Act, so, however, that in the sub-division the proportion between the amount
paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced Share shall be the same as
it was in the case of the Share from which the reduced Share is derived; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 66.5 | cancel any Shares that at the date of the passing of the
relevant Ordinary Resolution have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any
person; and 
---|---|--- 
 



15 denomination of its share capital. 
---|---|--- 



   67. | Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may: 
---|--- 



     | 67.1 | by Special Resolution change its name, alter or add to the
Memorandum with respect to any objects, powers or other matters specified
therein or alter or add to these Articles; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 67.2 | by Special Resolution reduce its issued share capital and
any capital redemption reserve fund or any share premium account. In relation
to such reductions, the Company may by Special Resolution determine the terms
upon which the reduction is to be effected, including in the case of a
reduction of part only of any class of Shares, those Shares to be affected;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | 67.3 | by resolution of the Directors change the location of its
registered office. 
---|---|--- 



   68. | Whenever as a result of an alteration or reorganisation of the
share capital of the Company any Members would become entitled to fractions of
a Share, the Directors may, on behalf of those Members, sell the
Shares representing the fractions for the best price reasonably obtainable to
any person and distribute the proceeds of sale in due proportion among those
Members, and the Directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument
of transfer of the Shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the
purchaser. The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the
purchase money nor shall her title to the Shares be affected by any

CLOSING REGISTER OF MEMBERS OR FIXING RECORD DATE

 



   69. | For the purpose of determining Members entitled to notice of or
to vote at any meeting of Members or any adjournment thereof, or Members
entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a
determination of Members for any other proper purpose, the Board may provide,
subject to the requirements of section 121 of the 1963 Act, that the Register
of Members shall be closed for transfers at such times and for such periods,
not exceeding in the whole 30 days in each year. If the Register of Members
shall be so closed for the purpose of determining Members entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of Members such Register of Members shall be so
closed for at least five (5) days immediately preceding such meeting and the
record date for such determination shall be the date of the closure of the
Register of Members. 
---|--- 



   70. | In lieu of, or apart from, closing the Register of Members, the
Board may fix in advance a date as the record date (a) for any such
determination of Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
the Members, which record date shall not be more than ninety (90) days nor
less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, and (b) for the
purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any
dividend, or in order to make a determination of Members for any other proper
purpose, which record date shall not be more than ninety (90) days prior to
the date of payment of such dividend or the taking of any action to which such
determination of Members is relevant. The record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Directors. 
---|--- 



   71. | If the Register of Members is not so closed and no record date is
fixed for the determination of Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of Members or Members entitled to receive payment of a dividend,
the date immediately preceding the date on which notice of the meeting is
deemed given under these Articles or the date on which the resolution of the
Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the
record date for such determination of Members. When a determination of
Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members has been made as provided
in these Articles, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof;
provided, however, that the Directors may fix a new record date of the
adjourned meeting, if they think fit.

Secretary to postpone any general meeting called in accordance with the
provisions of these articles (other than a meeting requisitioned under Article
73 of these Articles or the postponement of which would be contrary to the
Companies Acts, law or a court order pursuant to the Companies Acts) if the
Board considers that, for any reason, it is impractical or unreasonable to
hold the general meeting, provided that notice of postponement is given to
each Member before the time for such meeting. Fresh notice of the date, time
and place for the postponed meeting shall be given to each Member in
accordance with the provisions of these articles.  
---|---

receipt of such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive notice
shall not invalidate any resolution passed or any proceeding at any such
meeting. A Member present, either in person or by proxy, at any general
meeting of the Company or of the holders of any class of Shares in the
Company, will be deemed to have received notice of that meeting and, where
required, of the purpose for which it was called.

the meeting the Members present shall be a quorum. 
---|--- 



   86. | If the Board wishes to make this facility available to Members
for a specific or all general meetings of the Company, a Member may
participate in any general meeting of the Company, by means of a telephone,
video, electronic or similar communication equipment by way of which all
persons participating in such meeting can communicate with each other
simultaneously and instantaneously and such participation shall be deemed to
constitute presence in person at the meeting.

speak at any general meeting of the Company. 
---|--- 



   88. | The Chairman, if any, of the Board shall preside as Chairman at
every general meeting of the Company, or if there is no such Chairman, or if
she shall not be present within one hour after the time appointed for

---|--- 



   89. | The Chairman may, with the consent of any general meeting duly
constituted hereunder, and shall if so directed by the meeting, adjourn the
meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall
be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left
unfinished, or which might have be transacted, at the meeting from which the
adjournment took place. When a general meeting is adjourned for thirty days or
more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an
original meeting; save as aforesaid it shall not be necessary to give any

18 ---|--- 



     | 90.1 | Subject to the Companies Acts, a resolution may only be put
to a vote at a general meeting of the Company or of any class of Members if: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) | it is proposed by or at the direction of the Board; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | it is proposed at the direction of the Court; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | it is proposed on the requisition in writing of such number
of Members as is prescribed by, and is made in accordance with, section 132 of
the 1963 Act; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | it is proposed pursuant to, and in accordance with the
procedures and requirements of, Articles 98 or 99; or

decides that the resolution may properly be regarded as within the scope of
the meeting. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 90.2 | No amendment may be made to a resolution, at or before the
time when it is put to a vote, unless the Chairman of the meeting in her
absolute discretion decides that the amendment or the amended resolution may
properly be put to a vote at that meeting. 
---|---|--- 



     | 90.3 | If the Chairman of the meeting rules a resolution or an
amendment to a resolution admissible or out of order (as the case may be), the
proceedings of the meeting or on the resolution in question shall not be
invalidated by any error in her ruling. Any ruling by the Chairman of the
meeting in relation to a resolution or an amendment to a resolution shall be
final and conclusive. 
---|---|--- 



   91. | Except where a greater majority is required by the Companies Acts
or these Articles, any question proposed for a decision of the Members at any
general meeting of the Company or a decision of any class of Members at
a separate meeting of any class of Shares shall be decided by an Ordinary
Resolution. 
---|--- 



   92. | At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the

are to be counted. 
---|--- 



   93. | A poll demanded on the election of the Chairman or on a question
of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question
shall be taken at such time, not being more than ten days from the date

Chairman of the meeting directs, and any business other than that on which a
poll has been demanded may be proceeded with pending the taking of the poll.

one vote need not use all her votes or cast all the votes she uses in the
same way. 
---|--- 



   95. | If authorised by the Board, any vote taken by written ballot may
be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic or telephonic transmission,
provided that any such electronic or telephonic submission must either
set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined
that the electronic submission has been authorised by the Member or proxy. 
---|--- 
 



19 such meeting may make such arrangement and impose any requirement or
restriction it or she considers appropriate to ensure the security of a
general meeting including, without limitation, requirements for evidence of
identity to be produced by those attending the meeting, the searching of
personal property and the restriction of items that may be taken into the
meeting place. The Board and, at any general meeting, the chairman of such
meeting are entitled to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply with
such arrangements, requirements or restrictions.

as if the resolution had been passed at a general meeting of the Company duly
convened and held, and may consist of several documents in like form each
signed by one or more persons, and if described as a special resolution shall
be deemed to be a special resolution within the meaning of the 1963 Act. Any
such resolution shall be served on the Company.

send it on behalf of that Member.

---|--- 

APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS



   149. |

The Directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The initial division of the Board into classes shall
be made by the decision of the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Directors in office and each class need not be of equal size or number. The
term of the initial Class I directors shall terminate on the date of the 2015
annual general meeting; the term of the initial Class II directors shall
terminate on the date of the 2016 annual general meeting; and the term of the
initial Class III directors shall terminate on the date of the 2017 annual
general meeting. At each annual general meeting of Members beginning in 2015,
successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual general
meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. Save as otherwise permitted in
these Articles, Directors will be elected by way of Ordinary Resolution of
the Company in general meeting. If the number of Directors is changed, any
increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain
the number of Directors in each class as nearly equal as possible or as
the Chairman of the Board may otherwise direct. In no case will a decrease in
the number of Directors shorten the term of any incumbent Director. A Director
shall hold office until the annual general meeting for the year in which her
term expires and until her successor shall be elected and shall qualify,
subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal from office. Any vacancy on the Board, including a vacancy that
results from an increase in the number of directors or from the death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal of a Director, shall be
deemed a casual vacancy. Subject to the terms of any one or more classes or
series of preferred shares, any casual vacancy shall only be filled by
decision of a majority of the Board then in office, provided that a quorum is
present. Any Director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an
increase in the number of Directors of such class shall hold office for a term
that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. Any Director
elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an 

---|--- 
 



30 remaining term as that of her predecessor. A Director retiring at a meeting
shall retain office until the close or adjournment of the meeting. 
---|--- 



   150. | During any vacancy in the Board, the remaining Directors shall
have full power to act as the Board. If, at any general meeting of the
Company, the number of Directors is reduced below the minimum prescribed by
the Board in accordance with Article 114 due to the failure of any persons
nominated to be Directors to be elected, then in those circumstances, the
nominee or nominees who receive the highest number of votes in favour of
election shall be elected in order to maintain the prescribed minimum number
of Directors and each such Director shall remain a Director (subject to the
provisions of the Companies Acts and these articles) only until the conclusion
of the next annual general meeting of the Company unless such Director is
elected by the Members during such meeting. 
---|--- 



   151. | The Company may by Ordinary Resolution appoint any person to be
a Director. 
---|--- 



   152. | Alternate Directors: 
---|--- 



     | 152.1 | Any Director may appoint by writing under her hand any
person (including another Director) to be her alternate provided always that
no such appointment of a person other than a Director as an alternate shall
be operative unless and until such appointment shall have been approved by
resolution of the Directors. 
---|---|--- 



     | 152.2 | An alternate Director shall be entitled, subject to her
giving to the Company an address, to receive notices of all meetings of the
Directors and of all meetings of committees of Directors of which her
appointor is a member, to attend and vote at any such meeting at which the
Director appointing her is not personally present and in the absence of her
appointor to exercise all the powers, rights, duties and authorities of her
appointor as a Director (other than the right to appoint an alternate
hereunder). 
---|---|--- 



     | 152.3 | Save as otherwise provided in these Articles, an alternate
Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be
responsible for her own acts and defaults and she shall not be deemed to be
the agent of the Director appointing her. The remuneration of any such
alternate Director shall be payable out of the remuneration paid to the
Director appointing her and shall consist of such portion of the last
mentioned remuneration as shall be agreed between the alternate and the
Director appointing her. 
---|---|--- 



     | 152.4 | A Director may revoke at any time the appointment of any
alternate appointed by her. If a Director shall die or cease to hold the
office of Director the appointment of her alternate shall thereupon cease and
determine but if a Director retires by rotation or otherwise but is
reappointed or deemed to have been reappointed at the meeting at which she
retires, any appointment of an alternate Director made by her which was in
force immediately prior to her retirement shall continue after her re-
appointment. 
---|---|--- 



     | 152.5 | Any appointment or revocation pursuant to this Article 152
may be sent by delivery, post, cable, telegram, telex, telefax, electronic
mail or any other means of communication approved by the Directors and may
bear a printed or facsimile signature of the Director making such appointment
or revocation or in any other manner approved by the Directors. 
---|---|--- 
 

SECRETARY



   153. | The Secretary shall be appointed by the Board at such
remuneration (if any) and on such terms as it may think fit and any Secretary
so appointed may be removed by the Board. 
---|---

prescribed by the Board, and in any case, shall include the making and
keeping of records of the votes, doings and proceedings of all meetings of
the Members and the Board of the Company, and committees, and the
authentication of records of the Company. 
---|--- 
 



   155. | A provision of the Companies Acts or these articles requiring or
authorising a thing to be done by or to a Director and the Secretary shall not
be satisfied by its being done by or to the same person acting both
as Director and as, or in the place of, the Secretary. 
---|--- 

SEAL

 



   156. | The Company may, if the Board so determines, have a Seal
(including any official seals kept pursuant to the Companies Acts) which shall
only be used by the authority of the Board or of a committee of the
Board authorised by the Board in that regard and every instrument to which
the Seal has been affixed shall be signed by any person who shall be either a
Director or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary or some other person
authorised by the Board, either generally or specifically, for the purpose. 
---|--- 



   157. | The Company may have for use in any place or places outside
Ireland, a duplicate Seal or Seals each of which shall be a duplicate of the
Seal of the Company except, in the case of a Seal for use in sealing
documents creating or evidencing securities issued by the Company, for the
addition on its face of the word "Securities" and if the Board so determines,
with the addition on its face of the name of every place where it is to be
used.  
---|--- 

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND RESERVES



   158. | The Company in general meeting may declare dividends, but no
dividends shall exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. 
---|--- 



   159. | Subject to the Companies Acts, the Board may from time to time
declare dividends (including interim dividends) and distributions on Shares of
the Company outstanding and authorise payment of the same out of the funds
of the Company lawfully available therefore and in any currency chosen at its
discretion. 
---|--- 



   160. | The Board may, before declaring any dividends or distributions,
set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall
at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for any purpose of
the Company and pending such application may, at the like discretion, be
employed in the business of the Company. The Directors may also, without
placing the same to reserve, carry forward any profits which they may think it
prudent not to divide.  
---|--- 



   161. | No dividend, interim dividend or distribution shall be paid
otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the 1983 Act. 
---|--- 
 



   162. | Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to Shares
with special rights as to dividends or distributions, if dividends or
distributions are to be declared on a class of Shares they shall be declared
and paid according to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the Shares of
such class outstanding on the record date for such dividend or distribution as
determined in accordance with these Articles. 
---|--- 
 



   163. | The Directors may deduct from any dividend payable to any Member
all sums of money (if any) immediately payable by her to the Company in
relation to the Shares of the Company. 
---|--- 
 



   164. |

The Board or any general meeting declaring a dividend (upon the recommendation
of the Board), may direct that any dividend or distribution be paid wholly or
partly by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of paid up
Shares, debentures, or debenture 

---|--- 
 



32  stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways and where any
difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Board may settle the
same as they think expedient and in particular may issue fractional
certificates and fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any
part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members
upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of all
Members and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem
expedient to the Board.



   165. | Any dividend, distribution, interest or other monies payable in
cash in respect of Shares may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the
post, or sent by any electronic or other means of payment, directed to
the registered address of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the
holder who is first named on the Register of Members or to such person and to
such address as such holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such
cheque or warrant, electronic or other payment shall be made payable to the
order of the person to whom it is sent and payment of the cheque or warrant
shall be a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders
may give effectual receipts for any dividends, bonuses, or other monies
payable in respect of the Share held by them as joint holders. Any such
dividend or other distribution may also be paid by any other method (including
payment in a currency other than US$, electronic funds transfer, direct
debit, bank transfer or by means of a relevant system) which the Directors
consider appropriate and any Member who elects for such method of payment
shall be deemed to have accepted all of the risks inherent therein. The
debiting of the Companys account in respect of the relevant amount shall be
evidence of good discharge of the Companys obligations in respect of any
payment made by any such methods. 
---|--- 
 



   166. | No dividend or distribution shall bear interest against the
Company. 
---|--- 



   167. | If the Directors so resolve, any dividend which has remained
unclaimed for six years from the date of its declaration shall be forfeited

or not), and, for such purpose, may value any assets and determine how the
