securities to close out their short positions or to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales, or loan or pledge the ordinary shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling shareholders may also enter
into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus,
which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the selling shareholders have been advised that they may
not use shares registered on this registration statement to cover short sales of our ordinary shares made prior to the date the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, has been declared effective by the SEC. </P>

Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer is depositing with the Escrow Agent the Temporary Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Temporary Escrow Amount and shall hold the Temporary Escrow

instructed jointly in writing by the Parties and as shall be acceptable to the Escrow Agent, acting reasonably. Such joint written instructions, if any, referred to in the foregoing sentence
shall specify the type and identity of the investments to be purchased and/or sold. With respect to any such written instructions, the Escrow Agent will endeavor to comply with such instructions as soon as reasonably practicable. Subject to receipt
of joint written instructions as referred to above, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of those investments identified in the applicable joint instructions through the facilities of its own trading or capital
markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. In the absence of such joint written direction to the contrary, the Temporary Escrow Amount shall be invested in the Citibank Market Deposit Account (the&nbsp;&#147;<U>MDA</U>&#148;), an interest

relating to either the investment of the Escrow Fund or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment described herein. The Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment made
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment made prior to its maturity under the terms and conditions of this Agreement or for the failure of the Parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest
or reinvest the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation from third parties with respect to any investment directed hereunder; provided that the foregoing shall not limit the Escrow Agent&#146;s liability for
its bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. Except as expressly provided herein, the Escrow Fund shall not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, be assigned, hypothecated, pledged, alienated, released from escrow or transferred within
escrow (or otherwise dealt with in any manner which has the economic effect of any of the foregoing acts, on a current or prospective basis). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest the property held in escrow pursuant to the terms hereof until the following

The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with,
knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation the Merger Agreement, nor shall the
Escrow Agent be required to determine if any Person has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this
Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any Joint Release Instruction furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed and presented by the proper
Party or Parties. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers&#146; forms in the form of <U>Exhibit <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">A-1</FONT></U> and <U>Exhibit <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">A-2</FONT></U> attached hereto. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no
duty to solicit any payments which may be due to the Escrow Fund. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its
opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely the Escrow Fund until it shall be directed otherwise in a Final Determination. The
Escrow Agent may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation
with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or non-action based on such declaratory judgment. The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its selection in the event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or construction of
any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability or obligation with respect to the Escrow Fund except for the Escrow Agent&#146;s bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. To the extent
practicable, the Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute (other than with respect to a dispute involving the Escrow Agent) without making the Escrow Agent a party to the same. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable, directly or indirectly, for any (a)&nbsp;damages, losses or expenses arising out of the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or expenses which result from the
Escrow Agent&#146;s bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (b)&nbsp;special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), other than in connection with the Escrow
Agent&#146;s bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct, even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. </P>
