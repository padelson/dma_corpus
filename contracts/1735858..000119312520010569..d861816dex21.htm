(an " _FPAC Common Share_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior

32

action on the part of Founder, each Excluded Founder Share shall thereupon be
converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Surviving Delaware Company. For the avoidance of doubt, this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.11(d)_ shall occur after transfer and contribution in kind

the Transactions, which Person shall be selected by New Topco and FPAC (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") and shall act on behalf of the holders of FPAC Common
Shares entitled to the Per Share Merger Consideration, and enter into an
exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to New
Topco and the FPAC for the purpose of (i) exchanging Certificates (if any) or
uncertificated shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the FPAC Common Shares and (ii) effecting the contribution in kind
of newly issued membership interests of US Holdco to New Topco against the
issuance of New Topco Shares, as contemplated by _ Exhibit B_. As of the
Merger Effective Time and, subject to and in accordance with the completion
of the steps contemplated in _Exhibit B_ , New Topco shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the FPAC Common Shares, as
consideration for the deliveries by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _ Exhibit
B_, and for exchange in accordance with this _ Section 2.12_ through the
Exchange Agent, New Topco Shares issued pursuant to _ Section 2.11(a)_. All
New Topco Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _
Section 2.12_ shall be referred to as the " _FPAC Exchange Fund_ ".

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Merger Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record of
FPAC Common Shares who has the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration hereunder: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form to be
approved by New Topco and FPAC (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) prior to the Closing (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that, in respect of any Certificate, risk
of loss and title shall pass only upon receipt thereof (or of an affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) by the Exchange Agent or, in the case of uncertificated
FPAC Common Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter
of Transmittal, and shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as New Topco and FPAC may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates held by any holder of
FPAC Common Shares represented by Certificates. In the event a holder of FPAC
Common Shares does not deliver to the Exchange Agent a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal or does not deliver the Certificate(s) (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), where applicable, such Person shall not be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration relating to such
Certificate or uncertificated FPAC Common Share unless and until such Person
delivers a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and
Certificate(s) (or an affidavit loss in lieu thereof), as applicable, to the
Exchange Agent. Each Certificate or uncertificated FPAC Common Share shall at
any time after the Merger Effective Time represent only the right to receive,
upon compliance with these requirements, the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to _ Section 2.11_ and this _ Section 2.12_. The delivery of a
duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal is a condition to
each holder of FPAC Common Shares receiving any portion of the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 



33

    

(c) Upon receipt of a Letter of Transmittal (accompanied with all Certificates
representing FPAC Common Shares of the holder of such FPAC Common Shares, to
the extent such FPAC Common Shares are certificated (or an affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof)) duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by New Topco, the holder of such FPAC Common Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration into which
such FPAC Common Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.11(a)_ in book-entry from. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.12(c)_, each FPAC Common Share shall be deemed at any time
from and after the Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration which the
holders of FPAC Common Shares were entitled to receive in respect of such
shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.12(c)_. 

(d) Concurrently with the Closing, without any action of the FPAC
Stockholders, New Topco and FPAC shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to
the transfer agent the New Topco Shares and The Depository Trust Company book-
entry shares representing the New Topco Shares issued to the FPAC Stockholders
entitled to the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(e) All New Topco Shares delivered upon the surrender of FPAC Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
securities represented by such FPAC Common Stock and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of FPAC of the shares
of FPAC Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to

of FPAC Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of FPAC,
except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

2.13 _Lost Certificate_. In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
New Topco, the provision by such Person of a customary indemnity against any
claim that may be made against New Topco with respect to such Certificate, in
each case in a form approved by New Topco, and New Topco shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger
Consideration, deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance
with this _Article II._

2.14 _FPAC Warrants_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any holder of FPAC Warrants, each FPAC
Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
shall, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 4 of the Warrant Agreement,
automatically and irrevocably be modified to provide that such FPAC Warrant
shall no longer entitle the holder thereof to purchase the amount of share(s)
of FPAC Common Stock set forth therein and in substitution thereof such FPAC
Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to acquire such number of New Topco
Shares per FPAC Warrant, subject to adjustments as provided in Section 4 and
the last sentence of Section 3.1 of

 



34

    

 the Warrant Agreement, that such holder was entitled to acquire pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Warrant Agreement if the FPAC Warrant was
exercised prior to the Transactions. The parties shall cause the Warrant
Agreement to be amended or exchanged as of immediately prior the Merger
Effective Time to the extent necessary to give effect to this _Section_ __ _
2.14_, including adding New Topco as a party thereto, with the effect that
FPAC Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time will
be exchanged for warrants to purchase ordinary shares of New Topco.

 

2.15 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional New
Topco Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of FPAC Common
Stock, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of New Topco.

 

2.16 _Payments at Closing_. At the Closing, New Topco will pay (or cause to be
paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds:

 

(a) on behalf of the Company, pay or cause to be paid the Payoff Amount to

that prior to New Topco paying Globetrotter or its Affiliate the Nominal
Capital Expenses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.16(c)_, FPAC shall have

Agreement that relate to items presented on the Closing Statement shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the Accounting Principles Annex and IFRS
consistently applied. When the Final Closing Statement is determined, the

Consideration_ ", respectively, and each component of Final Net Debt
Difference and Final Total Consideration as set forth in their respective
definitions shall also be final. The FPAC Shareholders Representative shall

execution of appropriate access letters and similar agreements with New
Topcos accountants and auditors) relating to the preparation of the Closing
Statement. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by the GB Shareholders
Representative, then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with
clauses (A) or (B) below) shall become the Final Closing Statement and become
final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of the date (A) on which the
FPAC Shareholders Representative and the GB Shareholders Representative
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (B) all matters in dispute are
finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.19(b)_. During the thirty (30) days following the GB
Shareholders Representatives receipt of a Notice of Disagreement, the GB

resolution, the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
the agreement of the GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC
Shareholders Representative.

(b) If the GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders
Representative are unable to resolve the disputed items set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days following the GB Shareholders
Representatives receipt of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer
period as the GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders
Representative may mutually agree in writing), such dispute shall be submitted
to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by, (i)
KPMG, or (ii) in the event KPMG is (x) unable or unwilling to take such
assignment or (y) not independent, the dispute resolution group of a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm promptly and mutually
agreed upon by the GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders
Representative or, if the GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC
Shareholders Representative cannot promptly agree on an accounting firm
within forty-five (45) days after timely delivery of a Notice of Disagreement,
each of the GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders
Representative shall promptly select a nationally recognized accounting firm
and such two (2) accounting firms shall designate the dispute resolution group
of a third nationally recognized accounting firm that is not presently engaged
on material matters by either party or any of their respective Affiliates
(which term for this purpose shall not include any portfolio company (as that
term is generally understood in the private equity industry) of Globetrotter
or its Affiliates). The " _Accounting Firm_ " means either (x) KPMG, (y) the
accounting firm so agreed to by the GB Shareholders Representative and the
FPAC Shareholders Representative, or (z) the third accounting firm so
selected by the two (2) accounting firms, in each case in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 2.19(b)_. The GB Shareholders Representative and the
FPAC Shareholders Representative shall submit to the Accounting Firm, as
experts and not as arbitrators, for review and resolution all matters (but
only such matters) that are set forth in the Notice of Disagreement which
remain in dispute. The GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC
Shareholders Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select one
(1) of its partners experienced in purchase price adjustment disputes to make
a final determination of the Net Debt Difference and Total Consideration,
including in each case each component of the Net Debt Difference and the
Total Consideration as set forth in their respective definitions, calculated
with reference to the items that are in dispute as set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement. The GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders 

 



37

    

 Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm that, in resolving items
in the Notice of Disagreement that are still in dispute and in determining the
Net Debt Difference and Total Consideration, including in each case each
component of the Net Debt Difference and the Total Consideration as set forth
in their respective definitions, the Accounting Firm shall (i) not assign to
any item in dispute a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value for
such item assigned by the GB Shareholders Representative, on the one hand, or
the FPAC Shareholders Representative, on the other hand, or (B) less than the
smallest value for such item assigned by the GB Shareholders Representative,
on the one hand, or the FPAC Shareholders Representative, on the other hand,
(ii) make its determination in accordance with the guidelines and procedures
set forth in this Agreement and a single written presentation submitted by
each of the GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders
Representative and a single written response of each of the GB Shareholders
Representative and the FPAC Shareholders Representative to each such
presentation so submitted, (iii) render a final resolution in writing to the
GB Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders Representative
(which final resolution shall be requested by the GB Shareholders
Representative and the FPAC Shareholders Representative to be delivered not
more than thirty (30) days following the initial submission of such disputed
matters to the Accounting Firm), which, absent manifest error, shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties with respect to the Net Debt
Difference and Total Consideration, including in each case each component of
the Net Debt Difference and the Total Consideration as set forth in
their respective definitions, and (iv) provide a written report to the GB
Shareholders Representative and the FPAC Shareholders Representative, if
requested by either of them, which sets forth in reasonable detail the basis
for the Accounting Firms final determination. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by New Topco or a Subsidiary.

(c) The Closing Statement (as adjusted by the agreement of the parties or at
the direction of the Accounting Firm, as applicable) shall be deemed final for
the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.19_ upon the earliest of the (i)
failure of the FPAC Shareholders Representative to notify the GB
Shareholders Representative of a dispute within forty-five (45) days after
the FPAC Shareholders Representative receives the Closing Statement, (ii)
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.19(b)_, and (iii)

Accounting Firm.

 

(d) The Net Debt Adjustment Amount and the Consideration Adjustment Amount
shall be determined as follows, in each case, within five (5) Business Days
following the determination of the Final Closing Statement, in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.19(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.19(c)_, as applicable:

 

(i) The " _Net Debt Adjustment Amount_ " shall be equal to the Final Net Debt
Difference, if any, and shall be settled in either cash (" _Adjustment Cash_
") or New Topco Shares (" _Adjustment Shares for Net Debt Adjustment_ "), as
detailed herein. If the Net Debt Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then
New Topco shall pay or issue to Company Shareholders, as determined solely by
the GB Shareholders Representative, an amount equal to the Net Debt
Difference in either of (a) Adjustment Cash (expressed as a positive) or (b)
Adjustment Shares for Net Debt Adjustment (expressed as a positive). If the
Net Debt Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then New Topco shall redeem,
and the Company Shareholders shall transfer, a corresponding amount of
Adjustment Shares for Net Debt Adjustment (expressed as a negative).

 



38

    

(ii) The " _Consideration Adjustment Amount_ " shall be an amount, if any,
equal to the Final Total Consideration _minus_ the Estimated Total
Consideration and shall be settled in New Topco Shares (" _Adjustment Shares
for Consideration Adjustment_ "). If the Consideration Adjustment Amount is
positive, then New Topco shall issue a corresponding amount of Adjustment
Shares for Consideration Adjustment (expressed as a positive). If the
Consideration Adjustment Amount is negative number, then New Topco shall
redeem, and the Company Shareholders shall transfer, a corresponding amount
of Adjustment Shares for Consideration Adjustment (expressed as a negative).

 

(e) When giving effect to (i) and (ii) of _Section_ __ _ 2.19(d)_, New Topco
shall consider the impact in the aggregate of such issuance and / or
redemption, in which case the sum of Adjustment Shares for Net Debt Adjustment
and Adjustment Shares for Consideration Adjustment shall represent the " _Net
Adjustment Shares_ ". If Net Adjustment Shares is (i) positive, then New
Topco shall issue New Topco Shares to Company Shareholders subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.19(g)_ or (ii) if Net Adjustment Shares is negative, then
New Topco shall redeem, and the Company Shareholders shall transfer, for no
consideration, New Topco Shares from Company Shareholders, in each case of (i)
and (ii), in an amount equal to the Updated Allocable Share of Net Adjustment
Shares and after having delivered to the Company Shareholders evidence that
such issuances or redemptions, as applicable, have been reflected on the books
and records of New Topco.

(f) The GB Shareholders Representative shall determine the Updated Allocable
Share in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Management
Shareholders Agreement and provide written notice (the " _Updated Allocable
Share Notice_ ") thereof to New Topco.

(g) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.19_, if Net Adjustment Shares is
positive, then it shall be a condition to each Company Shareholder receiving
its Updated Allocable Share of the Net Adjustment Shares that such Company
Shareholder (i) execute and provide an original of a subscription form as
required under Swiss law and (ii) pay to New Topco the nominal value (CHF
0.01) of each Net Adjustment Share to be issued and received by such Company
Shareholder.

2.20  _Founder Contingent Share_ _s_.

_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, (ii) the contribution of Transferred Portion Company
Shares per _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_, and (iii) the contribution
of Transferred Remaining Company Shares per _Section_ __ _ 2.01(c)_, the
Founder shall contribute to New Topco the Excluded Founder Shares that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and,
in consideration for such contributed Excluded Founder Shares, New Topco
shall issue to Founder, and Founder shall direct New Topco to deliver such
newly issued New Topco Shares to the Nominee (as defined below), to 

 



39

    

 hold on behalf of the Founder, one New Topco Share for each contributed
Excluded Founder Share (each share, the " _FPAC Founder Contingent Share_ ");
_provided_ that, if the number of Redeemed Shares exceeds 20,000,000, then
the Founder will forfeit the Excluded Founder Shares for no consideration,
_provided_ _further_ , that if the number of Redeemed Shares exceeds 5,000,000
but is less than 20,000,000, the Founder will forfeit for no consideration a
number of Excluded Founder Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal
to the product of (i) 2,500,000 _multiplied by_ (ii) (A) the total number of
Redeemed Shares _minus_ 5,000,000  _divided by_ (B) 15,000,000. The number of
Founder Shares to be forfeited will correspondingly reduce the maximum number
of potential FPAC Founder Contingent Shares that may be earned on the First
Value Achievement Date and the Second Value Achievement Date.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in any event
prior to the Closing, the GB Shareholders Representative, New Topco and the
Founder shall reasonably cooperate to agree to and enter into a nominee

shall be a Swiss entity mutually agreed by the GB Shareholders
Representative and the Founder (the " _Nominee_ "). At the Closing, New Topco
shall deliver the FPAC Founder Contingent Shares to the Nominee. The Nominee

(i) if, at any time following the Closing, the VWAP of New Topco Shares is
greater than or equal to $12.50 for any twenty (20) Trading Days within any
thirty (30) Trading Day period (such time when the foregoing is first
satisfied, the " _First Value Achievement Date_ "), the Nominee shall within
fifteen (15) Business Days deliver to the Founder the number of New Topco
Shares that would have been equivalent in value to 1,250,000 shares of FPAC
Common Stock at the time of the Closing; and

 

(ii) if, at any time following the Closing, the VWAP of New Topco Shares is
greater than or equal to $15.00 for any twenty (20) Trading Days within any
thirty (30) Trading Day period (such time when the foregoing is first
satisfied, the " _Second Value Achievement Date_ "), the Nominee shall within
fifteen (15) Business Days deliver to the Founder the number of New Topco
Shares that would have been equivalent in value to 1,250,000 shares of FPAC
Common Stock at the time of the Closing.

The New Topco Share price targets set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.20(b)(i)_
and _Section_ __ _ 2.20(b)(ii)_ and the number of shares to be issued
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.20(b)(i)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.20(b)(ii)_

reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
or any similar event affecting New Topco Shares after the date of this

Delaware Company and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash amounts otherwise deliverable under this Agreement,
and from any other consideration otherwise paid or delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such amounts that any
such Persons are required to deduct and withhold with respect to any of the
deliveries and payments contemplated by this Agreement under the Code or any
other applicable Law. FPAC shall give the Company at least fifteen (15) __
days prior written notice of any anticipated deduction or withholding
(together with any legal basis therefor) to provide the Company with
sufficient opportunity to provide any forms or other documentation from the
applicable equity holders or take such other steps in order to avoid such
deduction or withholding and shall reasonably consult and cooperate with the
Company in good faith to attempt to reduce or eliminate any amounts that would
otherwise be deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.22_. To
the extent that FPAC, New Topco, the Company, the Surviving Delaware Company
or their respective Affiliates withholds such amounts with respect to any
Person and properly remits such withheld amounts to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to or on behalf of such Person. In the case of any such payment payable

The owner of record of each item of Company Registered Intellectual
Property is the entity identified as the current assignee and owner thereof

otherwise violating any rights relating to the Owned Intellectual Property in
any material respect; and (ii) there has been no inadvertent or unauthorized
disclosure of any material confidential or non-public information included in
the Company Intellectual Property. Neither the conduct of the business as
presently conducted, nor the exploitation by the Group of the Company
Owned Intellectual Property infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates
the Intellectual Property rights of a third party in any material respect. No
Group member has received a written notice alleging that the activities of the
Group infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property
of any third party, or has been involved in any dispute or proceeding relating
to Intellectual Property or has received any offer in writing to license any
third party Intellectual Property, in each case that has not since been
resolved without any material obligations for the Group. The

 



47

    

 Owned Intellectual Property has not been and is not the subject of any
outstanding injunction, judgement, order, decree, ruling, settlement or
disposition of any dispute. To the knowledge of the Company, there exist no
facts or circumstances which could reasonably provide the basis for any claim
or assertion adversely affecting the ownership, use, right to use,
enforceability or scope of any Owned Intellectual Property.

Liens) or other material right of a third Person in respect of the Owned
Intellectual Property and (ii) has a valid right to use all other Company
Intellectual Property as currently used by the Group (provided that the
foregoing representation will not be read as a representation of non-
infringement). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not directly impair or result in (i) the loss of any of the
members rights in any material Owned Intellectual Property or (ii) FPAC or
the Group being obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts to any Person
in excess of those payable to them in the absence of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. None of the Owned Intellectual Property nor,

Intellectual Property rights created or developed for Company or a Company
Subsidiary and has agreed to waive and did waive all moral rights such person
may have in any work in which copyright subsists of which such person is or
was the creator or an author (" _Proprietary Rights Agreement_ "), except
where such an assignment or waiver is deemed to have occurred by operation of
Law or, in the case of a lack of such express assignment, waiver or operation
of Law, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. No former or current employee, officer, consultant, or
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or entity engaged in
development of Intellectual Property with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (i) has breached or has threatened to breach such Proprietary
Rights Agreement in any material respect or (ii) has expressly excluded

Agreement _except_ in respect of a joint development agreement entered into
in the ordinary course of business, wherein the parties to such agreement have
agreed to not assign or transfer previously created background Intellectual
Property and/or to jointly own Intellectual Property created pursuant to the
joint development agreement wherein neither the withholding of background
Intellectual Property from the Company nor the restrictions on the use of
jointly developed Intellectual Property by the Company would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

contaminants, effects or routines, in each case intended to disrupt, impair,

tested backup and disaster recovery policies, procedures and systems to

its business, each applicable Group member has been and is in material
compliance with all applicable licenses with respect thereto.

Schedule_, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or any other
person acting on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has

delivery to any escrow agent or other party of, any Company Source Code. No
event has occurred, and no circumstances or condition exists, that (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) shall, or would reasonably be
expected to, require the disclosure or delivery by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any other party acting on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any third party of any Company Source Code (other than to any
escrow agent). The Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not currently have
on deposit, are not (and are not subject to an obligation by which they would
be) required to deposit, with an escrow agent or other third party, any

from escrow.

or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and no written request for any such
waiver or extension is currently pending.

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts, circumstances or
plans that, either alone or in combination, could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Transactions from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is party to or bound by (i)
any Tax sharing, Tax allocation, Tax indemnification or similar Contract or
arrangement that is currently in effect, or (ii) any Contract or arrangement
under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is liable for any Taxes of
another Person, except, in each case, for any such Contracts that
are commercial contracts not primarily relating to Taxes.

(g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to include
any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Closing Date as a result of any of the following that occurred or exists
on or prior to the Closing Date (i) a binding agreement with a Taxing
Authority or with any Governmental Authority in respect of Taxes, (ii) an
installment sale or open transaction, (iii) a prepaid amount, or (iv) a change
in the accounting method of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries.

(h) All material related party transactions involving the Company or any
Company Subsidiary are in material compliance with the arms length standards
of applicable Tax Laws.

(i) Assuming that (i) the Management Rollup is executed as of April 30, 2020,
at an assumed sum of Pre-Deal Dividend and Total Consideration equal to 1,650
million, (ii) the gains realized by Management Sellers on the disposal
of their shares are taxed at capital gain tax rates and are not requalified
and taxed as employment income, and (iii) the shares allocated to the
Management Sellers from the employee benefit trust will be subject to tax at
the highest marginal rates, the social security payable by the Global Blue
Group in relation to the Management Rollup is estimated to be around 750,000.

 

(j) The Companys Capital Contribution Reserves at December 31, 2019 equaled
CHF 460,000,000. This amount will be reduced as a result of the dividend that
is expected to be paid by the Company prior to Closing. To the knowledge of
the Company, the Company expects that immediately after Closing the Capital
Contribution Reserve of New Topco will be not less than the
Capital Contribution Reserve of the Company immediately prior to Closing, but
the final amount of Capital Contribution Reserve at the level of New Topco is
subject to confirmation from the Swiss federal Tax authorities which will be
applied for by way of a tax ruling sought with Swiss federal Tax authorities
prior to Closing, and the actual level of New Topcos Capital Contribution
Reserve may therefore ultimately be lower.

transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the Closing, no FPAC Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the
extent such FPAC Stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder. There are no Actions
pending or, to the knowledge of FPAC, threatened with respect to the Trust

comments, that such party receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus promptly after the receipt of
such comments and shall give the other parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any proposed written or oral responses to such comments
prior to responding to the SEC or its staff. FPAC, the Company and New Topco
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Form F-4 to be declared
effective as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC and to
keep the Form F-4 effective through the Closing in order to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) FPAC shall file the Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Exchange Act. FPAC agrees to include provisions
in the Proxy Statement and to take reasonable action related thereto, with
respect to (i) approval of the Business Combination (as defined in the
Certificate of Incorporation) (the " _Transaction Proposal_ ") and (ii) and
approval of any other proposals reasonably agreed by FPAC and the Company to
be necessary or appropriate in connection with the transaction contemplated
hereby (the " _Additional Proposal_ " and, together with the Transaction
Proposal, the " _Proposals_ "). Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the Proposals shall be the only matters (other than procedural
matters) which FPAC shall propose to be acted on by FPACs stockholders
at the Special Meeting.

 



93

    

(d) New Topco shall file the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to
Rule 424. FPAC, the Company and New Topco shall use reasonable best efforts
to, as promptly as practicable (and in any event, within seven Business Days
after the SEC Clearance Date), (i) establish the record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting in accordance with the
DGCL for a date no later than 30 days following the SEC Clearance Date, (ii)
cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be disseminated to FPACs stockholders
in compliance with applicable Law and (iii) solicit proxies from the holders

Proposals (the " _FPAC Board Recommendation_ ") and shall include the FPAC
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus; _provided_ , _however_
, that the FPAC Board may change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or
publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify its
recommendation (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") if it determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and/or financial
advisors, that a failure to make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably
be expected to constitute a breach by the FPAC Board of its fiduciary
obligations to FPACs stockholders under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_, if on a date for
which the Special Meeting is scheduled, FPAC has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of FPAC Common Stock to obtain the
FPAC Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, FPAC shall
have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of
the Special Meeting; _provided_ , that the Special Meeting (i) is not
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 45 days after the date for
which the Special Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments
or postponements required by applicable Law) and (ii) is held no later than
three Business Days prior to the Termination Date.

 

9.03 _Exclusivity_.

take, nor shall the Companys shareholders or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives take, whether directly or indirectly, any action to solicit,
initiate, continue or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or enter
into any agreement with, or encourage, respond, provide information to or
commence due diligence with respect to, any Person (other than FPAC and/or any
of its Affiliates or Representatives) concerning, relating to or which is
intended or is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in any purchase of
any of equity securities of, or membership interests in, or the issuance and
sale of any equity securities of, or membership interests in, the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries (other than any purchases of equity securities by the
Company from employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or any merger or
sale of substantial assets involving the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
in each case, other than the Transactions or as provided in this Agreement
(any such purchase, issuance, sale or merger, an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"). If any Seller Party or the Company or any of the Companys shareholders
or any of its Affiliates or Representatives receives any inquiry or proposal
regarding an Acquisition Transaction at any time prior to the Closing, then
the Company shall promptly notify such Person indicating only that it is
subject to an exclusivity agreement that prohibits providing any information
related to or entertaining any proposals or offers or engaging in any
negotiations or discussions concerning any Acquisition Transaction and, in
such event, the Company shall also promptly notify FPAC of such facts and
circumstances. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or

 



94

    

 negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect
to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, an Acquisition
Transaction. During the Interim Period, the Seller Parties shall not, except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including the Management Rollup,
the Restructuring and the Pre-Deal Dividend), directly or indirectly transfer
any interest (direct or indirect, record, beneficial, economic voting or
otherwise) in the Company Shares, whether by sale or exchange, by gift, by
operation of law, by pledge or encumbrance or otherwise.

 

(b) During the Interim Period, FPAC shall not take, nor shall any of its
Affiliates or Representatives take, whether directly or indirectly, any
action to solicit, initiate, continue or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or enter into any agreement with, or encourage, respond, provide
information to or commence due diligence with respect to, any Person (other
than the Company, its shareholders and/or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives), concerning, relating to or which is intended or is
reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, any offer, inquiry, proposal
or indication of interest, written or oral relating to any Business
Combination (a " _Business Combination Proposal_ ") other than with the
Company, its shareholders and their respective Affiliates and Representatives.
If FPAC or any of its Affiliates or Representatives receives any inquiry or
proposal regarding a Business Combination Proposal at any time prior to the
Closing, then FPAC shall promptly notify such Person indicating only that it
is subject to an exclusivity agreement that prohibits them from providing
any information considering such inquiry or proposal and, in such event, FPAC
shall also promptly notify the GB Shareholders Representative of such facts
and circumstances. FPAC shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect
to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, a Business
Combination Proposal.

 

9.04 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, New Topco shall pay or cause to be paid all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, value added or other similar Taxes incurred
in connection with the Transactions (the " _Transfer Taxes_ "). New Topco or
its Affiliates, as appropriate, shall, at its own expense, file all necessary
Tax Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by applicable
Law, FPAC will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

(b) _Tax Treatment_. New Topco, FPAC, US Merger Sub and the Company intend
that the Transactions shall qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment and for
the Intended Swiss Tax Treatment. None of the parties or their respective
Affiliates shall knowingly take or cause to be taken, or knowingly fail to
take or knowingly cause to be failed to be taken, any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent qualification for such Intended Tax
Treatment or such Intended Swiss Tax Treatment or the confirmation of the
Capital Contribution Reserves of New Topco as provided for in  _Section_ __ _
3.16(j)_. Each party shall, unless otherwise required by a final determination
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar state, local
or non-U.S. final determination) or a change in applicable Law, or based on a
change in the facts and circumstances underlying the Transactions from the
terms described in this Agreement, cause all Tax Returns to be filed on a
basis of treating the Merger as a transaction that qualifies under Section
351 of the Code and that does not subject shareholders of

 



95

    

 FPAC and the Company to tax under Section 367 of the Code (subject to the
entry into gain recognition agreements by any such shareholders required to
enter into such agreements to preserve tax-free treatment under Section 367 of
the Code). Each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
promptly notify all other parties of any challenge to the Intended Tax
Treatment, the Intended Swiss Tax Treatment or the confirmation of the
Capital Contribution Reserves of New Topco as provided for in _Section_ __ _
3.16(j)_ by any Governmental Authority. Each of FPAC, the Company and New
Topco shall execute and deliver officers certificates containing customary
representations at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by
counsel to the Company in connection with the delivery of any opinion by such
counsel to the Company with respect to the tax treatment of the Transactions.
Prior to Closing, New Topco and the Company shall, in close consultation with
FPAC and its tax advisors, use reasonable efforts to prepare and obtain
customary Tax rulings with the Swiss Tax authorities confirming the Intended
Swiss Tax Treatment and the confirmation of the Capital Contribution Reserves
of New Topco as provided for in _Section_ __ _ 3.16(j)_ and the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to mitigate any negative Tax consequences if the
Intended Swiss Tax Treatment cannot be fully achieved.

9.05 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

 

(a) FPAC acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(b) The GB Shareholders Representative and FPAC shall reasonably cooperate
to (a) prepare and make a public announcement regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the date hereof and (b) create and implement
a communications plan regarding the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Communications Plan_ ") promptly following the date hereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the parties hereto will make any public announcement or
issue any public communication regarding this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or any matter
related to the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the GB
Shareholders Representative, in the case of a public announcement by FPAC, or
FPAC, in the case of a public announcement by any other party hereto (such
consents, in either case, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (i) if such announcement or other communication is required
by applicable Law (including pursuant to Securities Laws or the rules of any
national securities exchange), in which case the disclosing party shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, first allow such other parties to
review such announcement or communication and the opportunity to comment
thereon and the disclosing party shall consider such comments in good faith,
(ii) in the case of Globetrotter, FPAC and their respective Affiliates, if
such announcement or other communication is made in connection with
fundraising or other investment related activities and is made to such
Persons direct and indirect investors or potential investors or financing
sources subject to an obligation of confidentiality, (iii) to the extent
provided for in the Communications Plan, internal announcements to employees
of the Company, (iv) to the extent such announcements or other communications
contain only information previously disclosed in a public statement, press
release or other communication previously approved in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_, and (v) announcements and communications to
Governmental Authorities in connection with filings or permits relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby required to be made under this Agreement.

Company, New Topco and FPAC shall take all actions necessary or appropriate
to cause (a) the number of directors constituting the board of directors of
New Topco to be such number as is specified in _Schedule 9.06_ and (b) the
individuals set forth in _Schedule 9.06_ (together with any other individuals
mutually agreed in writing between the GB Shareholders Representative and
FPAC period to Closing) to be elected as members of the board of directors of
New Topco, effective as of the Closing. On the Closing Date, New Topco shall
enter into customary indemnification agreements, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the GB Shareholders Representative and FPAC, with
the individuals who will be directors of New Topco, which indemnification
agreements shall continue to be effective following the Closing in accordance
with their terms.

9.07 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Closing, New Topco shall indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of each of FPAC and the Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Party_")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred (including
the advancing of expenses as incurred) in connection with any Action, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent that FPAC
or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have
been permitted under applicable Law and their respective certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect as of the
date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person. Without limiting the
foregoing, New Topco shall, (i) maintain for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Closing provisions in its certificate of incorporation (if
applicable), bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of officers and directors that are no less favorable to those
Persons than the provisions in such certificates of incorporation, bylaws and
other organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
(ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect
that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each
case, except as required by Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing, New Topco shall, or shall
cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect directors and
officers liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered
by FPACs, the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries directors and
officers liability insurance policies on terms not less favorable than the
terms of such current directors and officers liability insurance policies;
_provided_ that (i) FPAC or the Company, as applicable, shall cause coverage
to be extended under the current directors and officers liability insurance
policies by obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms not less
favorable than the terms of such current directors and officers liability

 



97

    

 insurance policies with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior
to the Closing and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six (6)
year period, such insurance shall be continued in respect of such claim until
the final disposition thereof. All costs associated with such "tail policies"
shall be borne by the Company.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section_ __ _ 9.07_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on New Topco and all
successors and assigns of New Topco. In the event that New Topco or any of
their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, New Topco shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of New Topco, as the case may be, shall
succeed to and assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.07_.
The obligations of New Topco under this _Section_ __ _ 9.07_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Party without such DandO Indemnified Partys consent.

 

(d) With respect to any indemnification obligations of New Topco pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.07_, New Topco shall be the indemnitor of first resort
with respect to all indemnification obligations of New Topco pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.07_ (i.e., its obligations to an applicable DandO Indemnified
Party are primary and any obligation of any other Person to advance expenses
or to provide indemnification and/or insurance for the same expenses or
liabilities incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party are secondary) and New
Topco irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases any such other Person
from any and all claims for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof.

9.08 _R andW Policy_. During the policy period of the RandW Policy, the Company
and New Topco shall not, and shall not permit any of their Affiliates to,
amend, modify or waive the subrogation provisions of the RandW Policy in a
manner that is adverse to the Company Shareholders or any of their Affiliates
without the prior written consent of each of the GB Shareholders
Representative and the FPAC Shareholders Representative.

 

9.09 _Post-Closing Cooperation; Further Assurances_. Following the Closing,
each party shall, on the request of any other party, execute such further
documents, and perform such further acts, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to give full effect to the allocation of rights, benefits,
obligations and liabilities contemplated by this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

9.10 _Registration Rights Agreement_. At the Closing, New Topco and certain
persons who will be shareholders of New Topco after Closing shall have
entered into a Registration Rights Agreement substantially in the form of

_ 12.12_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO

12.13 _Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof and thereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
each of which remedies (including under this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_) may be
pursued simultaneously, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and without that right, none of the parties would have
entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or any Transaction Document and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_ shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

(b) Each party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for
in this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_, a party shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such party
under this Agreement or any Transaction Document in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_ are not available or otherwise are not granted,
and (ii) nothing set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 12.13_ shall require any
party to institute any action or proceeding for (or limit any partys right to
institute any Action or proceeding for) specific performance under this 
_Section_ __ _ 12.13_ prior to or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, nor shall the commencement of
any Action or proceeding pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 12.13_ or anything
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_ restrict or limit any partys right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of  _Section_ __ _
11.01_ or to pursue any other remedies under this Agreement or any Transaction
Document that may be available then or thereafter.

 



108

claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in
this Agreement), (a) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement
and (b) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or
representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability
(whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, the Seller Parties, New Topco,
US Holdco, US Merger Sub or FPAC under this Agreement of or for any claim
based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

12.15 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements in
this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and other
provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire upon the
occurrence of the Closing (and there shall be no liability after the Closing
in respect thereof), except for (a) those covenants and agreements contained
herein that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in part after the
Closing and then only with respect to any breaches occurring after the
Closing and (b) this _Article XII_. Nothing herein is intended to limit any
partys liability for such partys Fraud.

7.1 Subject to this Agreement and mandatory Swiss law, including without

(i) no Put Option or Call Option has been exercised in accordance with a Put
Transfer Notice or Call Transfer Notice (as applicable) in respect of the

Company has obtained a tax ruling from the Swiss Federal Tax Authority that
the redemption is not a payment or distribution subject to Swiss taxes
including but not limited to Swiss Federal Withholding, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Holders of a majority of Series A Preferred Shares, for

if earlier, upon a change of control of the Company which would result in the
Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares receiving an amount equal to or
greater than $10.00 per Series A Preferred Share]2 (the " _Redemption
Transfer Intention_ "). After thirty (30) calendar days following but within
45 days following the Redemption Transfer Intention, the Company shall have
the right to issue an irrevocable notice of its intention to redeem the Series
A Preferred Shares which were the subject of the Redemption Transfer Intention
(the " _Redemption Transfer Notice_ ") provided the VWAP of the Series A
Preferred Shares on an As-Converted Basis on the trading day prior to the
Redemption Transfer Notice is equal to or greater than $10.00. The Redemption
Transfer Notice shall specify the date and time on which the Redemption (as
defined below) is to be completed, which shall be no later than two (2)
Business Days following the date of the Redemption Transfer Notice (the "
_Redemption Effective Time_ "). There shall be no limit on the number of
Redemption Transfer Intentions that the Company is permitted to issue per
calendar year but no such notice shall be issued within 60 Business Days of a
previous Redemption Transfer Intention unless approved by the Preferred
Holder Majority (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

7.2 Following issue of a valid Redemption Transfer Notice in accordance with
Clause 7.1, the Company may redeem some or all of the Series A Preferred
Shares (pro-rata among all Holders) (the " _Redemption_ ") at the Redemption
Effective Time for the VWAP of the Series A Preferred Shares on an As-
Converted Basis on the trading day prior to the Redemption Effective Time on
an As-Converted Basis, payable in cash or Common Shares (at the Companys
election) (such amount being the " _Redemption Amount_ ").

7.3 If the conditions in Clause 7.1(i) are satisfied but Clause 7.1(ii) is not
satisfied because there are insufficient Capital Contribution Reserves to
effect the Redemption (but all other mandatory Swiss law requirements,
including Article 659 et seq. Swiss Code of Obligations, are complied with),
the Company shall still have the right to issue a Redemption Transfer Notice
specifying the Redemption Effective Time, which shall in this case be a date
at least forty (40) calendar days after the date on which such notice is
delivered to the Holders or such other date and time as the Preferred Holder
Majority and the Company may agree. Such Redemption Transfer Notice shall also
provide each Holder with the right to exercise the Put Option (in substitution
for the Redemption, which would no longer occur), provided that such Holder
delivers a Put Transfer Notice in accordance with Clause 5.1 above and so long
as the Put Transfer Notice is delivered to the Company on a date at least ten
(10) calendar days prior to the Redemption Effective Time.

operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

judicial or administrative body to be null, void or unenforceable, said

without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of
another jurisdiction. 

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including any question regarding its conclusion, existence,
validity, invalidity, breach, amendment or termination (each, a "Dispute"),
shall be finally resolved by arbitration under Rules of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") in force at the time of such
submission (the "Rules"). The Rules are deemed to be incorporated by

The number of arbitrators shall be three. The Claimant(s) shall nominate one

arbitrator (or any arbitrator that Claimant(s) or Respondent(s) shall fail

arbitration shall be English.

 

The arbitral proceedings shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 12 of

participants without the prior written consent of all parties to the
arbitration, except to the extent: (i) required by law and applicable internal
reporting requirements; or (ii) necessary to recognize, confirm or enforce
the final award in the arbitration.

The Parties hereby agree that, in the event of a dispute relating to any
matter contained both in this Agreement and in the Articles, the provisions
of this Agreement will prevail and, in particular, the provisions of this
Clause 22 shall take precedence over the dispute resolution provisions in the
Articles.

 

23\. _Remedies_ _; Specific Performance_.

 

The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Clause 17, the Company will be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

WHEREAS, this Agreement is being entered into in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

REGISTRATION

 

1.1. _Demand Registrations_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, solely if the Company has
failed to file the Shelf Registration Statement or maintain its effectiveness
as provided in Section 1.3, any Demand Shareholders (" _Requesting
Shareholders_ ") shall be entitled to make written requests of the Company

 



1

    

 (each, a " _Demand_ ") for registration under the Securities Act of an
amount of Registrable Securities then held by such Requesting Shareholders
(such amount, in the case where SL Sponsor is a Requesting Shareholder, to
include a number of Registrable Securities held by the Escrow Agent determined
pursuant to the Management Shareholders Agreement) that equals or is greater
than the Registrable Amount (a " _Demand Registration_ "). Thereupon the
Company will, subject to the terms of this Agreement, use its reasonable best
efforts to effect the registration as promptly as practicable under the
Securities Act of:

 

(i) the Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to
register by the Requesting Shareholders for disposition in accordance with
the intended method of disposition stated in such Demand;

(ii) all other Registrable Securities which the Company has been requested to
register pursuant to Section 1.1(b), but subject to Section 1.1(h); and

 

(iii) all Company Shares which the Company may elect to register in connection
with any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 1.1, but
subject to Section 1.1(h),

all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance with
the intended methods thereof) of the Registrable Securities and the
additional Company Shares, if any, to be so registered.

(b) A Demand shall specify (i) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities
requested to be registered in such Demand Registration, (ii) the intended
method of disposition in connection with such Demand Registration, to the
extent then known and (iii) the identity of the Requesting Shareholder(s).
Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of a Demand, the Company shall
give written notice of such Demand to all Other Holders of Registrable
Securities. The Company shall include (but only on a pro rata basis among the
Requesting Shareholder and the Other Holders that have requested to
participate in such Demand Registration based upon the relative number of
Registrable Shares then held by each such Requesting Shareholder and Other
Holders) in the Demand Registration covered by such Demand all Registrable
Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request
for inclusion therein from the Other Holders thereof within five (5) days
after the Companys notice required by this paragraph has been given, subject
to Section 1.1(h). Each such written request shall comply with the
requirements of a Demand as set forth in this Section 1.1(b).

 

(c) During each fiscal year of the Company, SL Sponsor shall have the right to
request up to nine (9) Demand Registrations and/or deliver Take-Down Notices
pursuant to Section 1.3, in the aggregate, and FP/TP Sponsor shall have the
right to request up to three (3) Demand Registrations and/or deliver Take-Down
Notices pursuant to Section 1.3, in the aggregate (of which only two (2)
Take-Down Notices may be for Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offerings).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the FP/TP Sponsor shall not be entitled to
request a Demand Registration, deliver a Take-Down Notice or a Piggyback
Notice or sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration statement,
at any time when the SL Sponsor is restricted from selling Registrable
Securities pursuant to Clause 6.2 or Clause 6.9 of the Management Shareholders
Agreement; provided, however, that this sentence shall not be applicable in
so far as it relates to Clause 6.9 of the Management

 



2

    

 Shareholders Agreement if the FP/TP Sponsor (or Far Point or Third Point
individually if it is requesting a Demand Registration, delivering a Take-Down
Notice or otherwise selling Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration
statement that in each case would not involve sales by the other) does not
possess material nonpublic information with respect to the Company or its
securities and has no representative on the Company Board. A Demand
Registration shall not be deemed to have been effected and shall not count as
a Demand Registration (A) unless a registration statement with respect thereto
has become effective and has remained effective for a period of at least one
hundred eighty (180) days or such shorter period in which all Registrable
Securities included in such Demand Registration have actually been sold
thereunder ( _provided_ that such period shall be extended for a period of
time equal to the period the Holder of Registrable Securities refrains from
selling any securities included in such registration statement at the request
of the Company or the lead managing underwriter(s) pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement) or (B) if, after it has become effective, such Demand
Registration becomes subject, prior to one hundred eighty (180) days after
effectiveness, to any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of
the Commission or other Governmental Authority, other than by reason of any
act or omission by the applicable Selling Stockholders.

(d) Demand Registrations shall be on Form F-1 or Form F-3 if the Company is
eligible under Applicable Law to register Registrable Securities on Form
F-3 or, if the Company reasonably believes another registration form of the
Commission would be more appropriate, such other appropriate registration form
of the Commission as shall be selected by the Company and reasonably
acceptable to the Requesting Shareholders.

(e) The Company shall not be obligated to (i) subject to Section 1.1(c),
maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities
Act filed pursuant to a Demand Registration for a period longer than one
hundred eighty (180) days or (ii) effect any Demand Registration (A) within
forty-five (45) days of a "firm commitment" Underwritten Offering in which
all Demand Shareholders were offered "piggyback" rights pursuant to Section
1.2 (subject to Section 1.2(b)) and at least 90% of the number of Registrable
Securities requested by such Demand Shareholders to be included in such
Underwritten Offering were included and sold or (B) during the first year
after the Closing Date, within three (3) months of the completion of any other
Demand Registration.

 

(f) The Company shall be entitled to postpone (upon written notice to the
Requesting Shareholders and any Other Holders whose Registrable Securities
are covered by such Demand pursuant to Section 1.1(b)) the filing or the
effectiveness of a registration statement for any Demand Registration in the
event of a Blackout Period until the expiration of the applicable Blackout
Period. In the event of a Blackout Period, the Company shall deliver to the
Requesting Shareholders requesting registration and any Other Holders whose
Registrable Securities are covered by such Demand pursuant to Section 1.1(b) a
certificate signed by either the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that, in the good faith judgment
of the Company, the conditions described in the definition of Blackout Period
are met.

 

(g) If the Majority in Interest of the Requesting Shareholders so advise the
Company as part of their Demand Registration that the offering of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such Requesting

 



3

    

 Shareholder or Other Holders that have requested to include Registrable
Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon such Requesting
Shareholders participation in such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion
of such Requesting Shareholders Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Offering to the extent provided herein (for the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that SL Sponsor acts as Requesting Shareholder on behalf of the Escrow
Agent, including the Registrable Securities held by the Escrow Agent and
included in the Underwritten Offering in accordance with the Management
Shareholders Agreement). All such Requesting Shareholders and Other
Holders (including the Escrow Agent and, if required, Management
Shareholders) proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this Section 1.1(g) shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 1.1(i).

(h) If, in connection with a Demand Registration or Shelf Offering that
involves an Underwritten Offering, the lead managing underwriter(s) advise(s)
the Company that, in its (their) opinion, the inclusion of all of the
securities sought to be registered in connection with such
Demand Registration or Shelf Offering would adversely affect the success
thereof, then the Company shall include in such registration statement only
such securities as the Company is advised by such lead managing underwriter(s)
can be sold without such adverse effect as follows and in the following order
of priority: (i) first pro rata among the Holders that have requested to
participate in such Demand Registration or Shelf Offering based on the
relative number of Registrable Shares then held by each such Holder
(including, in the event that SL Sponsor has included Registrable Securities
held by the Escrow Agent, such Registrable Shares, as if they were held by SL
Sponsor); (ii) second, other securities of the Company duly requested to be
included in such registration statement by other persons, pro rata on the
basis of the amount of such other securities requested to be included or such
other allocation method determined by the Company; and (iii) third, securities
the Company proposes to sell.

(i) Any time that a Demand Registration or Shelf Offering involves an
Underwritten Offering, the Majority in Interest of the Requesting
Shareholders shall select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) that will
serve as managing underwriters (including which of such managing underwriters
will serve as lead or co-lead) and underwriters and their respective
economics with respect to the offering of such Registrable Securities;
_provided_ that such investment banker(s) and manager(s) shall be subject to
the prior written consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

1.2. _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, whenever the Company proposes
to register any Company Ordinary Shares under the Securities Act for its own
account or for the account of other persons who are not Demand Shareholders
(other than the PIPE Registration Statement or a registration by the Company
(i) on Form F-4 or any successor form thereto, (ii) on Form S-8 or any
successor form thereto, or (iii) pursuant to Section 1.1) (a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "), the Company shall give all Holders prompt written
notice thereof (but not less than ten (10) days prior to the filing by the
Company with the Commission of any registration statement with respect
thereto). Such notice (a " _Piggyback Notice_ ") shall specify the number of
Company Shares proposed to be registered, the proposed date of filing of such
registration statement with the Commission, the

 



4

    

 proposed means of distribution, the proposed managing underwriter(s) (if
any) and a good faith estimate by the Company of the proposed minimum offering
price of such Company Ordinary Shares, in each case to the extent then known.
Subject to Sections 1.1 (b) and 1.2(b), the Company shall include in each such
Piggyback Registration all Registrable Securities held by Holders (a "
_Piggyback Seller_ ") with respect to which the Company has received written
requests (which written requests shall specify the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be disposed of by such Piggyback Seller) for inclusion
therein within ten (10) days after such Piggyback Notice is received by such
Piggyback Seller.

(b) If, in connection with a Piggyback Registration that involves an
Underwritten Offering, the lead managing underwriter(s) advises the Company
that, in its opinion, the inclusion of all the Company Ordinary Shares sought
to be included in such Piggyback Registration by (i) the Company, (ii) other
Persons who have sought to have Company Ordinary Shares registered in such
Piggyback Registration pursuant to rights to demand (other than pursuant to
so-called "piggyback" or other incidental or participation registration
rights) such registration pursuant to agreements entered into by the Company
in accordance with Section 3.14 (such Persons, if any, being " _Other
Demanding Sellers_ "), (iii) the Piggyback Sellers and (iv) any other proposed
sellers of Company Ordinary Shares (such Persons being " _Other Proposed
Sellers_ "), as the case may be, would adversely affect the success thereof,
then the Company shall include in the registration statement applicable to
such Piggyback Registration only such Company Ordinary Shares as the Company
is so advised by such lead managing underwriter(s) can be sold without such an
effect, as follows and in the following order of priority:

 

(i) if the Piggyback Registration relates to an offering for the Companys own
account, then (A) first, such number of Company Ordinary Shares to be sold by
the Company as the Company, in its reasonable judgment and acting in good
faith and in accordance with sound financial practice, shall have determined,
(B) second, Registrable Securities of Piggyback Sellers, pro rata based on
the number of Registrable Shares then held by each such Piggyback Seller
(including, in the case of SL Sponsor, Registrable Shares held by the Escrow
Agent and included with SL Sponsors Registrable Shares as if they were held
by SL Sponsor), (C) third, Company Ordinary Shares sought to be registered by
Other Demanding Sellers, pro rata on the basis of the number of Company

(ii) if the Piggyback Registration relates to an offering other than for the
Companys own account, then (A) first, such number of Company Ordinary Shares

pro rata based on the number of Registrable Shares then held by all such

(c) For clarity, in connection with any Underwritten Offering under this
Section 1.2 that is initiated by the Company, the Company shall not be
required to include the Registrable Securities of a Piggyback Seller in the
Underwritten Offering unless such Piggyback Seller accepts the terms of the
underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and the lead managing
underwriter(s); in connection with any Underwritten Offering under this
Section 1.2 that is not initiated by the Company, the Company shall not be
required to include the Registrable Securities of a Piggyback Seller in the
Underwritten Offering unless such Piggyback Seller accepts the terms of the
underwriting as agreed upon between the Majority in Interest of the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in such offering and the lead
managing underwriter(s).

(d) If, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register
any Company Ordinary Shares as set forth in this Section 1.2 and prior to the
time the registration statement filed in connection with such Piggyback
Registration is declared effective, the Company shall determine for any reason
not to register such Company Ordinary Shares, the Company may, at its
election, give written notice of such determination to the Piggyback Sellers
within five (5) Business Days thereof and thereupon shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with
such particular withdrawn or abandoned Piggyback Registration; _provided_
that Demand Shareholders may continue the registration as a Demand
Registration pursuant to the terms of Section 1.1.

 

(e) Any time that a Piggyback Registration involves an Underwritten Offering
that is initiated by the Company, the Company shall select the investment
banker(s) and manager(s) that will serve as managing underwriters (including
which of such managing underwriters will serve as lead or co-lead) and
underwriters with respect to the offering of such Registrable Securities and
their respective economics; in the event that a Piggyback Registration
involves an Underwritten Offering that is not initiated by the Company, the
Majority in Interest of the Holders of Registrable Securities
participating in such offering shall select the investment banker(s) and
manager(s) that will serve as managing underwriters (including which of such
managing underwriters will serve as lead or co-lead) and underwriters with
respect to the offering of such Registrable Securities and their respective
economics; _provided_ that such investment banker(s) and manager(s) shall be
subject to the prior written consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

1.3. _Shelf Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Promptly, but in any event within forty-five (45) days from the date
hereof, the Company shall file a registration statement on Form F-1 or any
successor form thereto to register all of the Registrable Securities of the
Holders (which registration statement shall be amended, converted or replaced,
as provided in the following sentence, with a registration statement on Form
F-3 or any successor form thereto (" _Form F-3_")) providing for an offering
to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ "); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to delay the
filing of the Shelf Registration Statement until such time as any financial
statements required by Applicable Law are available for inclusion in the Shelf
Registration Statement. The Company shall cause the Shelf Registration
Statement to be amended and/or converted to, or replaced with, a registration
on Form F-3 as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Company becomes
eligible to use Form F-3 under Applicable Law. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective by the Commission
as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing date, the Shelf
Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of
an amount of 

 



6

    

 Registrable Securities then held and specified by such Demand Shareholders
(and including Registrable Securities held by the Escrow Agent) that equals or
is greater than the Registrable Amount and including a plan and method of
distribution substantially in the form of Exhibit A or as otherwise specified.

(b) Subject to Section 1.3(c), the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to keep a Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until
the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities covered by the
Shelf Registration Statement have been sold thereunder in accordance with the
plan and method of distribution disclosed in the prospectus included in the
Shelf Registration Statement, or otherwise cease to be Registrable Securities;
and (ii) the date on which this Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 3.1.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company shall be entitled, from time to time, by providing written notice
to the Holders whose Registrable Securities are registered under the Shelf
Registration Statement, to require such Holders to suspend the use of the
prospectus for sales of Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration
Statement during any Blackout Period. In the event of a Blackout Period, the
Company shall deliver to such Holders a certificate signed by either the chief
executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company certifying
that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the conditions described in
the definition of Blackout Period are met. After the expiration of any
Blackout Period, the Company shall deliver a notice of such expiration to
Holders of Registrable Securities and without any further request from a
Holder of Registrable Securities, the Company to the extent necessary shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective amendment or
supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or the prospectus, or any
document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable
Securities included therein, the prospectus will not include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

 

(d) If one or more Demand Shareholders deliver a notice to the Company (a "
_Take-Down Notice_ ") stating that such Demand Shareholder(s) intend to sell
at least a Registrable Amount of Registrable Securities on the Shelf
Registration Statement in an Underwritten Offering (a " _Shelf Offering_ "),
the Company shall promptly, and in a manner reasonably agreed with such
Demand Shareholder(s) amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement as
may be necessary in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be
distributed pursuant to the Shelf Offering. The Demand Shareholders shall have
the right to request the number of Shelf Offerings provided for in Section
1.1(c). In connection with any Shelf Offering that is an Underwritten Offering
and where the plan of distribution set forth in the applicable Take-Down
Notice includes a customary "road show" (including an "electronic road show")
or other substantial marketing effort by the Company and the underwriters (a "
_Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering_ "), unless the Take-Down Notice
is executed by or on behalf of all the Demand Shareholders (even if all the
Demand Shareholders are not participating in such Marketed Underwritten Shelf
Offering), the Company shall forward the Take-Down Notice to all other Demand
Shareholders whose Registrable Securities are included on the Shelf
Registration Statement and the Company and such proposing Demand
Shareholder(s) shall permit each such other Demand Shareholder to include (but
only on a pro rata basis with the 

 



7

    

 proposing Demand Shareholder based on the relative number of Registrable
Shares then held by each such Demand Shareholder) its Registrable Securities
(including, in the case of SL Sponsor, Registrable Securities held by the
Escrow Agent in an amount determined in accordance with the Management
Shareholders Agreement) included on the Shelf Registration Statement in the
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering if such other Demand Shareholder
notifies the proposing Demand Shareholder(s) and the Company within two (2)
days after delivery of the Take-Down Notice to such other Demand Shareholder.

 

In connection with any Shelf Offering that is an Underwritten Offering but is
not a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering (a " _Non-Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Offering_"), the Company shall forward the Take-Down Notice to all other
Demand Shareholders whose Registrable Securities are included on the Shelf
Registration Statement and the Company and such proposing Demand
Shareholder(s) shall permit each such other Demand Shareholder to include (but
only on a pro rata basis with the proposing Demand Shareholder based on the
relative number of Registrable Shares then held by each such Demand
Shareholder) its Registrable Securities (including, in the case of SL Sponsor,
Registrable Securities held by the Escrow Agent in an amount determined in
accordance with the Management Shareholders Agreement) included on the
Shelf Registration Statement in the Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering
if such other Demand Shareholder notifies the proposing Demand Shareholder(s)
and the Company within 24 hours of receiving the Take-Down Notice.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, no Other Holders (except the Escrow Agent on
behalf of the Management Shareholders as provided herein and, for the
avoidance of doubt, except a non-proposing Demand Shareholder in accordance
with Section 1.1(e)) will be entitled to participate in Shelf Offerings unless
SL Sponsor determines otherwise in a written notice delivered to the Company
and such Other Holders (in which case such Other Holders shall be treated the
same as a non-proposing Demand Shareholder with respect to such
Shelf Offerings).

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, any Shelf Offering will be subject to Sections
1.1(h) and (i).

 

(g) Upon the written request of any Demand Shareholder, the Company will file
and seek the effectiveness of a post-effective amendment to the Shelf
Registration Statement to register additional Registrable Securities that
would have been included in the Shelf Registration Statement had they been
owned by such Demand Shareholder on the date hereof (or, if such additional
Registrable Securities cannot be registered pursuant to a post-effective
amendment under Applicable Law, an additional shelf registration statement);
provided that when the Company effects a Demand Shareholder request to file
such a post-effective amendment (or additional shelf registration statement),
it shall notify the other Holders and provide such other Holders a reasonable
opportunity to include additional Registrable Securities in such amendment (or
additional shelf registration statement).

 

1.4. _Withdrawal Rights_. Any Demand Shareholder having notified or directed
the Company to include any or all of its Registrable Securities in a
registration statement under the Securities Act shall have the right to
withdraw any such notice or direction with respect to any or all of the
Registrable Securities designated by it for registration by giving written
notice to such effect to the Company prior to the effective date of such
registration statement. In the event of any such withdrawal, the Company shall
not include such Registrable Securities in the applicable registration 

 



8

    

 and such Registrable Securities shall continue to be Registrable Securities
for all purposes of this Agreement (subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement). No such withdrawal shall affect the obligations of the
Company with respect to the Registrable Securities not so withdrawn if any
other Demand Shareholder has requested that Registrable Securities be included
in such registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a Demand
Registration, if such withdrawal shall reduce the number of Registrable
Securities sought to be included in such registration below the Registrable
Amount, then the Company shall as promptly as practicable give each
Demand Shareholder seeking to register Registrable Securities notice to such
effect and, within ten (10) days following the mailing of such notice, such
Demand Shareholders still seeking registration shall, by written notice to the
Company, elect to register additional Registrable Securities to satisfy the
Registrable Amount or elect that such registration statement not be filed or,
if theretofore filed, be withdrawn. During such ten (10) day period, the
Company shall not file such registration statement if not theretofore filed
or, if such registration statement has been theretofore filed, the Company
shall not seek, and shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent, the
effectiveness thereof.

 

1.5. _Underwriter Lock-up Agreements_. (a) In connection with any Underwritten
Offering in which a Holder participates pursuant to Section 1.2, each such
Holder agrees to enter into customary agreements, including such customary
carve-outs and limitations as any such Holder may reasonably request,
restricting the public sale or distribution of equity securities of the
Company (including sales pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 145 under the Securities
Act) to the extent requested in writing by the lead managing underwriter(s)
with respect to an applicable Underwritten Offering during the period
commencing on the date of the "pricing" of such Underwritten Offering) and
continuing for not more than the lesser of (i) the period to which the Company
(subject to customary carve-outs and limitations) is restricted and (ii)
ninety (90) days for the first offering of Company Shares after the Closing
Date and forty-five (45) days thereafter, in each case, after the date of the
"final" prospectus (or "final" prospectus supplement if the Underwritten
Offering is made pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement), pursuant to
which such Underwritten Offering shall be made, or such other period as is
required by the lead managing underwriter(s). Any discretionary waiver or
termination of the requirements under the foregoing provisions made by the
Company or applicable lead managing underwriter(s) shall apply to each Holder
on a pro rata basis.

 

(b) If any Demand Registration involves an Underwritten Offering or in the
event of a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering, the Company will not effect
any public sale or distribution of any ordinary share capital (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for ordinary share capital)
(other than a registration statement on Form F-4, Form S-8 or any successor
forms thereto) for its own account, within ninety (90) days, after the date of
such Underwritten Offering or Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering, as
applicable, except as may otherwise be agreed between the Company and the lead
managing underwriter(s) of such Underwritten Offering or Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Offering, as applicable.

 

1.6. _Registration Procedures_.

 

(a) If and whenever the Company is required to use reasonable best efforts to
effect the registration and/or offering of any Registrable Securities under
the Securities Act as provided in Section 1.1, Section 1.2 or Section 1.3, the
Company shall as expeditiously as reasonably practicable:

 



9

    

(i) prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement to
effect such registration in accordance with the intended method or methods of
distribution of such securities and thereafter use reasonable best efforts to

the terms of this Article I; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may
discontinue any registration of its securities which are not Registrable
Securities at any time prior to the effective date of the registration
statement relating thereto;  _provided_ , _further_ , that before filing such
registration statement or any amendments thereto, the Company will furnish to
the Holders which are including Registrable Securities in such registration ("
_Selling Stockholders_ "), their counsel and the lead managing underwriter(s)

which documents will be subject to the review and reasonable comment of such
counsel, and other documents reasonably requested by such counsel, including
any comment letter from the Commission, and, if requested by such counsel,
provide such counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
preparation of such registration statement and each prospectus included
therein. The Company shall not file any such registration statement or
prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto with respect to a Demand
Registration to which the Holders of a majority of Registrable
Securities held by the Selling Stockholder(s), their counsel or the lead

timely basis, unless, in the opinion of the Company, such filing is necessary
to comply with Applicable Law; 

(ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith

registration statement;

permit the intended method of distribution of such securities and make all
required filings of such prospectus supplement or such post-effective
amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company has received
such request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to take any actions under this Section 1.6(a)(iii) that are not, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, in compliance with Applicable Law;

(iv) furnish to the Selling Stockholders and each underwriter, if any, of the
securities being sold by such Selling Stockholders such number of conformed
copies of such registration statement and of each amendment and supplement
thereto, such number of copies of the prospectus contained in such
registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary
prospectus) and each free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act) (a " _Free Writing Prospectus_ ") utilized in connection
therewith and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the Securities
Act, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other
documents as such Selling Stockholders and underwriter, if any, may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the
Registrable Securities owned by such Selling Stockholders;

"blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Stockholders and any
underwriter of the securities being sold by such Selling Stockholders shall
reasonably request, and to keep each such registration or qualification (or
exemption therefrom) effective during the period such registration statement
is required to be kept effective and take any other action which may be
necessary or reasonably advisable to enable such Selling Stockholders and
underwriters to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
Registrable Securities owned by such Selling Stockholders, except that the
Company shall not for any such purpose be required to (A) qualify generally
to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would
not but for the requirements of this clause (v) be obligated to be so
qualified, (B) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) file
a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction;

(vi) use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be
listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the
Company are then listed and, if no such securities are so listed, use
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market;

(vii) use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with or
approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be
reasonably necessary to enable the Selling Stockholder(s) thereof to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(viii) use reasonable best efforts to provide and cause to be maintained a
transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement from and after a date not later than the effective date

form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings and in
connection therewith, (A) make representations and warranties to the Holders
of such Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, with respect to

incorporated by reference therein, in each case, in form, substance and scope
as are customarily made by issuers in underwritten offerings, and, if true,
confirm the same if and when requested, (B) include in the underwriting
agreement indemnification provisions and procedures substantially to the
effect set forth in Section 1.9 hereof with respect to the underwriter and all
parties to be indemnified pursuant to said Section except as otherwise agreed

deliver such documents and certificates as are reasonably requested by the
Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold, their counsel

"comfort" letters and updates thereof (or, in the case of any such Person
which does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of a "comfort" letter
specified in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72, an "agreed upon
procedures" letter to the extent deliverable in accordance with the policies
of such accountants) signed by the independent public accountants who have
certified the Companys financial statements and, to the extent required, any
other financial statements included in such registration statement, covering
the matters customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with

records, pertinent corporate documents and instruments of the Company
(collectively, the " _Records_ "), as shall be reasonably necessary, or as
shall otherwise be reasonably requested, to enable them to exercise their due
diligence responsibility, and cause the officers, directors and employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries (and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its auditors) to participate in customary due diligence calls and to supply
all information in each case reasonably requested by any such representative,

registration statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to provide any information under this clause (xi) if (A) the Company
reasonably believes, after consultation with counsel for the Company, that to
do so would cause the Company to forfeit an attorney-client privilege that was
applicable to such information or (B) if either (1) the Company has requested
and been granted from the Commission confidential treatment of such
information contained in any filing with the Commission or documents provided
supplementally or otherwise or (2) the Company reasonably determines in good
faith that such Records are confidential and so notifies the Inspectors in
writing; unless prior to furnishing any such information with respect to
clause (1) or (2) such Selling Stockholder requesting such information enters
into, and causes each of its Inspectors to enter into, a confidentiality
agreement on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Company;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each Selling Stockholder agrees that it will,
upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of
competent jurisdiction or by another Governmental Authority, give notice to
the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate
action seeking to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential;

 



12

    

(xii) as promptly as practicable notify in writing the Selling
Stockholders and the underwriters, if any, of the following events: (A) the

or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction or the initiation or threat of any
proceeding for such purpose; (E) if at any time the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in any underwriting agreement contemplated
by Section 1.6(a)(ix) cease to be true and correct in any material respect;
and (F) subject to the provisions of this Agreement relating to a Blackout
Period, upon the happening of any event that makes any statement made in such
registration statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect
or that requires the making of any changes in such registration statement,
prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the registration statement,
it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the prospectus, it
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and, at the
request of any Selling Stockholder, promptly prepare and furnish to such
Selling Stockholder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an
amendment of such registration statement or prospectus as may be necessary so

material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading;

(xiii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement, or the lifting of
any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any

Section 1.6(a)(v), the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to
(A) qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in

(xiii) be obligated to be so qualified, (B) subject itself to taxation in any
such jurisdiction or (C) file a general consent to service of process in any
such jurisdiction;

(xiv) cooperate with the Selling Stockholders and the lead managing
underwriter(s) to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of

under Applicable Law) representing securities sold under any registration
statement, and enable such securities to be in such denominations
and registered in such names as the lead managing underwriter(s) or such
Selling Stockholders may request and keep available and make available to the
Companys transfer agent prior to the effectiveness of such registration
statement a supply of such certificates;

 



13

    

(xv) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and

Securities pursuant to the applicable registration statement and prospectus
relating thereto until such Selling Stockholders receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 1.6(a)(xii), or
until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable

reference in such prospectus; _provided_ , that the amount of time the Holder
is required to discontinue disposition of such securities shall not exceed
thirty (30) days; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall extend the
time periods under Section 1.1(c) with respect to the length of time that the
effectiveness of a registration statement must be maintained by the amount of
time the Holder is required to discontinue disposition of such securities.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Registrable Securities held
by the Escrow Agent are being registered and sold in connection with a Demand
Registration or a Piggyback Registration, SL Sponsor shall be entitled to act

1.8. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) Except with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement, ot less than two
(2) days (and in the case of Section 1.3(d), 24 hours) before the expected
filing date of each registration statement pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company shall notify each Holder of Registrable Securities who has timely
provided the requisite notice hereunder entitling such Holder to
register Registrable Securities in such registration statement of the
information, documents and instruments from such Holder that any underwriter
reasonably requests in connection with such registration statement, including,
to the extent applicable, a questionnaire, custody agreement, power of
attorney, lock-up letter (not to exceed a sixty (60) days lock-up period) and
underwriting agreement (the " _Requested Information_ "). If the Company has
not received, on or before the day before the expected filing date, the
Requested Information from such Holder, the Company may file the registration
statement without including Registrable Securities of such Holder. The
failure to so include in any registration statement the Registrable Securities
of a Holder of Registrable Securities (with regard to that registration
statement) shall not result in any liability on the part of the Company to
such Holder.

(b) The Company shall not grant any demand, piggyback or shelf registration
rights, the terms of which are senior to or conflict with the rights granted
to the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder to any other Person, or
enter into any other agreements that conflict with the rights granted to the
Holders of Registrable Securities under this Agreement (except to the extent
contemplated under the definition of Blackout Period), without the prior
written consent of Demand Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities then held by all Demand Shareholders. The foregoing shall not
apply to the PIPE Registration.

(c) The Company will cooperate with the Holders and the managing
underwriter(s), if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates or book entries (which, in either case, shall not bear any
restrictive legends) representing shares to be sold by any Holder pursuant to
any registration statement or sold pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 145 under the
Securities Act, and enable such shares to be in such denominations and
registered in such names as the selling Holders or managing underwriter(s) may
request.

 

1.9. _Registration Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Company agrees, without limitation as to time, to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each Selling Stockholder
and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, members,
shareholders, employees, managers, partners and agents and each Person who
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section
20 of the Exchange Act) such Selling Stockholder or such other indemnified
Person and the officers, directors, members, shareholders, employees,
managers, partners, accountants, attorneys and agents of each such controlling
Person, from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) and amounts paid in settlement (collectively,
the " _Losses_ "), as incurred, arising out of, caused by, resulting from or
relating to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material
fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto
or any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
prospectus, preliminary prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by any
information furnished in writing to the Company by any Selling Stockholder
expressly for use therein.

 



16

    

(b) In connection with any registration statement in which a Selling
Stockholder is participating, without limitation as to time, each such
Selling Stockholder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify the Company,
its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, managers, partners and
agents, and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, from and
against all Losses, as incurred, arising out of, caused by, resulting from or
relating to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of material
fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto
or any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
prospectus, preliminary prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading, in each case solely to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement or omission is made in such registration
statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or
any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information regarding such Selling Stockholder furnished to the
Company by such Selling Stockholder expressly for inclusion in such
registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Selling Stockholder shall be liable under this Section 1.9(b)
for amounts in excess of the net proceeds received by such Holder in the
offering giving rise to such liability.

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt written
notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , the failure to give such notice
shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligation, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party has been actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure to provide such notice on a timely basis.

(d) In any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified
party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent
that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof and acknowledging the obligations of the indemnifying party
with respect to such proceeding, the indemnifying party will not (so long as
it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle
the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such
indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expense subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof
(unless (i) such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on
the grounds that there are defenses available to it which are different from
or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying party, (ii) a
conflict of interest exists between the interests of the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed
within a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and the indemnified
party is or would reasonably be expected to be materially prejudiced by such
delay, in either of which events the indemnified party shall be promptly
reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the reasonable fees and expenses

 



17

    

 incurred in connection with retaining one separate legal counsel (for the
avoidance of doubt, for all indemnified parties in connection therewith) plus
one local counsel or (iv) such indemnifying party otherwise so agrees). For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any such assumption by an indemnifying
party, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such matter and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party
except as provided in the previous sentence. An indemnifying party shall not
be liable for any settlement of an action or claim effected without its
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). No matter shall be settled by an indemnifying party without the
consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement (x) includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation, (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of
fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified
party and (z) is settled solely for cash for which the indemnified party
would be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(e) The indemnification and contribution provided for under this Agreement
shall survive the sale of the Registrable Securities and the termination of
this Agreement.

(f) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification
provisions for any reason or reasons other than as specified therein, any
Person who would otherwise be entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof
shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution with respect to any Losses
with respect to which such Person would be entitled to such indemnification
but for such reason or reasons, in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand,
and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the
actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified
party, the Persons relative knowledge and access to information concerning
the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to
correct and prevent any statement or omission, and other
equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. It is hereby
agreed that it would not necessarily be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who
was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Selling Stockholder shall be required to make a contribution in
excess of the net proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from its sale
of Registrable Securities in connection with the offering that gave rise to
the contribution obligation.

EXHIBIT A

 

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The selling securityholders, including their pledgees, donees, transferees,
distributees, beneficiaries or other successors in interest, may from time to
time offer some or all of the shares of common stock (collectively,
"Securities") covered by this prospectus. To the extent required, this
prospectus may be amended and supplemented from time to time to describe a
specific plan of distribution.

 

The selling securityholders will not pay any of the costs, expenses and fees
in connection with the registration and sale of the Securities covered by
this prospectus, but they will pay any and all underwriting discounts, selling
commissions and stock transfer taxes, if any, attributable to sales of the
Securities. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our notes and
the common stock covered hereby.

The selling securityholders may sell the Securities covered by this prospectus
from time to time, and may also decide not to sell all or any of the
Securities that they are allowed to sell under this prospectus. The selling
securityholders will act independently of us in making decisions regarding the
timing, manner and size of each sale. These dispositions may be at fixed
prices, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to
such prevailing market prices, at varying prices determined at the time of
sale, or at privately negotiated prices. Sales may be made by the selling
securityholders in one or more types of transactions, which may include:



     |  |  |

purchases by underwriters, dealers and agents who may receive compensation in
the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions from the
selling securityholders and/or the purchasers of the Securities for whom they
may act as agent; 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

one or more block transactions, including transactions in which the broker or
dealer so engaged will attempt to sell the Securities as agent but may
position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the
transaction, or in crosses, in which the same broker acts as an agent on both
sides of the trade; 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

ordinary brokerage transactions or transactions in which a broker solicits
purchases; 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

purchases by a broker-dealer or market maker, as principal, and resale by the
broker-dealer for its account;  

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

the pledge of Securities for any loan or obligation, including pledges to
brokers or dealers who may from time to time effect distributions of
Securities; 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

short sales or transactions to cover short sales relating to the Securities; 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

one or more exchanges or over the counter market transactions; 

---|---|---|--- 
        |  |  |

through distribution by a selling securityholder or its successor in interest
to its members, general or limited partners or shareholders (or their
respective members, general or limited partners or shareholders); 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

privately negotiated transactions; 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

the writing of options, whether the options are listed on an options exchange
or otherwise;  

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

distributions to creditors and equity holders of the selling securityholders;
and 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

any combination of the foregoing, or any other available means allowable under
applicable law.  

---|---|---|--- 

A selling securityholder may also resell all or a portion of its Securities in
open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 or Rule 145 under the
Securities Act provided it meets the criteria and conforms to the requirements
of Rule 144 or Rule 145, as applicable, and all applicable laws and
regulations.

 

The selling securityholders may enter into sale, forward sale and derivative
transactions with third parties, or may sell securities not covered by this
prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. In
connection with those sale, forward sale or derivative transactions, the third
parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus, including in short
sale transactions and by issuing securities that are not covered by this
prospectus but are exchangeable for or represent beneficial interests in the
common stock. The third parties also may use shares received under those sale,
forward sale or derivative arrangements or shares pledged by the selling
securityholder or borrowed from the selling securityholders or others to
settle such third-party sales or to close out any related open borrowings of
common stock. The third parties may deliver this prospectus in connection
with any such transactions. Any third party in such sale transactions will be
an underwriter and will be identified in a supplement or a post-effective
amendment to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part as
may be required.

In addition, the selling securityholders may engage in hedging transactions
with broker-dealers in connection with distributions of Securities or
otherwise. In those transactions, broker-dealers may engage in short sales of
securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume with selling
securityholders. The selling securityholders may also sell securities short
and redeliver securities to close out such short positions. The selling
securityholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-
dealers which require the delivery of securities to the broker-dealer. The
broker-dealer may then resell or otherwise transfer such securities pursuant
to this prospectus. The selling securityholders also may loan or pledge
shares, and the borrower or pledgee may sell or otherwise transfer the
Securities so loaned or pledged pursuant to this prospectus. Such borrower or
pledgee also may transfer those Securities to investors in our securities or
the selling securityholders securities or in connection with the offering of
other securities not covered by this prospectus.

To the extent necessary, the specific terms of the offering of Securities,
including the specific Securities to be sold, the names of the selling
securityholders, the respective purchase prices and public offering prices,
the names of any underwriter, broker-dealer or agent, if any, and any
applicable

   

 compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions paid to
underwriters or agents or paid or allowed to dealers will be set forth in a
supplement to this prospectus or a post-effective amendment to this
registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. The selling
securityholders may, or may authorize underwriters, dealers and agents to,
solicit offers from specified institutions to purchase Securities from the
selling securityholders at the public offering price listed in the applicable
prospectus supplement. These sales may be made under "delayed delivery
contracts" or other purchase contracts that provide for payment and delivery
on a specified future date. Any contracts like this will be described in and
be subject to the conditions set forth in a supplement to this prospectus or a
post-effective amendment to this registration statement of which this
prospectus forms a part. 

Broker-dealers or agents may receive compensation in the form of commissions,
discounts or concessions from the selling securityholders. Broker-dealers or
agents may also receive compensation from the purchasers of Securities for
whom they act as agents or to whom they sell as principals, or both.
Compensation as to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of
customary commissions and will be in amounts to be negotiated in connection
with transactions involving securities. In effecting sales, broker-dealers
engaged by the selling securityholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to
participate in the resales. 

In connection with sales of Securities covered hereby, the selling
securityholders and any underwriter, broker-dealer or agent and any other
participating broker-dealer that executes sales for the selling
securityholders may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Accordingly,
any profits realized by the selling securityholders and any compensation
earned by such underwriter, broker-dealer or agent may be deemed to be
underwriting discounts and commissions. Selling securityholders who are
"underwriters" under the Securities Act must deliver this prospectus in the
manner required by the Securities Act. This prospectus delivery requirement
may be satisfied through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange in
accordance with Rule 153 under the Securities Act or satisfied in accordance
with Rule 174 under the Securities Act.

We and the selling securityholders have agreed to indemnify each other
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
In addition, we or the selling securityholders may agree to indemnify any
underwriters, broker-dealers and agents against or contribute to any payments
the underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may be required to make with
respect to, civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
Underwriters, broker-dealers and agents and their affiliates are permitted to
be customers of, engage in transactions with, or perform services for us and
our affiliates or the selling securityholders or their affiliates in the
ordinary course of business.

 

In order to comply with applicable securities laws of some states or
countries, the Securities may only be sold in those jurisdictions
through registered or licensed brokers or dealers and in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. In addition, in certain states or countries
the Securities may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified
for sale in the applicable state or country or an exemption from the
registration or qualification requirements is available. In addition, any
Securities of a selling securityholder covered by this prospectus that qualify
for sale pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 145 under the Securities Act may be
sold in open market transactions under Rule 144 or Rule 145 rather than
pursuant to this prospectus.

   

In connection with an offering of Securities under this prospectus, the
underwriters may purchase and sell securities in the open market. These
transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases
to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the
underwriters of a greater number of securities than they are required to
purchase in an offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or
purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the securities while an offering is in progress.

The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular
underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount
received by it because the underwriters have repurchased securities sold by or
for the account of that underwriter in stabilizing or short-covering
transactions.

 

These activities by the underwriters may stabilize, maintain or otherwise
affect the market price of the Securities offered under this prospectus. As a
result, the price of the Securities may be higher than the price that
otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced,
they may be discontinued by the underwriters at any time. These transactions
may be effected on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Exchange or
another securities exchange or automated quotation system, or in the over-
the-counter market or otherwise.

1. The Series A Preferred Shares have the same dividend (including liquidation dividends), voting and other rights as common shares. 

   | 
  

2. Jede Vorzugsaktie der Kategorie A verleiht ein Recht auf eine (zusatzliche) Vorzugsdividende ("Vorzugsdividende").

 |  |

2. Each Series A Preferred Share confers an (additional) preference dividend ("Preference Dividend") as follows: 

   | 
  

a. Fur die fur das Geschaftsjahr 2025/2026 (d.h. erstmals an der ordentlichen
Generalversammlung 2026) und danach beschlossenen Dividendenbeschlusse
(einschliesslich Beschlusse betreffend ausschuttbare Reserven) ein Betrag
entsprechend 8% p.a. ("Prozentsatz") von USD 10, unter der Voraussetzung,
dass die Generalversammlung eine entsprechende Dividende beschliesst und die
einschlagigen Bestimmungen des Schweizerischen Obligationenrechts sowie
sonstige fur die Gesellschaft geltende rechtliche Vorschriften eingehalten
werden. Insbesondere darf keine Vorzugsdividende ausgerichtet werden, insoweit

 |  |

a. For dividends resolved (including resolutions regarding
distributable reserves) for the financial year 2025/2026 (i.e. the first time
at the ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders 2026) and thereafter an amount
equal to 8% per annum ("Percentage") of USD 10, under the prerequisite that
the General Meeting of Shareholders resolves a corresponding dividend and

b. Der Prozentsatz erhoht sich in jedem auf das Geschaftsjahr
2025/2026 folgenden Geschaftsjahr jeweils um einen weiteren Prozentpunkt p.a.

 |  |

b. The Percentage shall increase in each financial year after 2025/2026 by
an additional one percentage point per annum. 

   | 
  

c. Die Generalversammlung kann beschliessen, in einem Geschaftsjahr
keine Dividende auszuschutten, oder eine Dividende auszuschutten, welche zur
vollstandigen Zahlung einer Vorzugsdividende nicht ausreicht; diesfalls
verfallt am Ende dieses Jahres der entsprechende restliche Betrag der
Vorzugsdividende fur dieses Geschaftsjahr, dieser Betrag wird nicht auf das
nachste Geschaftsjahr vorgetragen und erhoht den auf der Basis des kunftig
anwendbaren Prozentsatzes nicht.

 |  |

c. The General Meeting of Shareholders may resolve in any given year not
to distribute dividends, or to distribute dividends in an amount not covering
the full amount of the Preference Dividend; in such cases the respective
remaining amount of the Preference Dividend of such year is forfeited at the
end of such year, shall not be carried forward to the following year(s) and
does not increase the basis of the subsequently applicable Percentage. 

   | 
  

Die ordentliche Dividende fur die Stamm- und Vorzugaktien der Kategorie A kann
beschlossen werden, nachdem die Generalversammlung die Bezahlung der
Vorzugsdividende fur das betreffende Jahr vollumfanglich beschlossen hat.

resolved once the General Meeting of Shareholders has approved the payment of
the Preference Dividend for the respective year in full.

 |  |

3. Each Series A Preferred Share confers the right to receive after all debts have been satisfied a priority share of the liquidation proceeds in an amount equal to 10 (ten) USD (United States Dollars). After distribution of the liquidations proceeds to the Series A Preferred Shares, the remainder shall be distributed on the common shares.

 |  |

4. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is authorized to acquire all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Shares in exchange for cash and/or common shares (sourced, in particular, from treasury shares or shares issued out of authorized share capital) pursuant to a contractual arrangement between the Company and the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares which grants the holders put rights and the Company call rights and redemption rights (the "Conversion Agreement"). 

   | 
  

5. Die Ausgabe neuer Vorzugsaktien und die Abanderung bzw. Aufhebung dieses Artikels 3b bedarf der Zustimmung einer Sonderversammlung der Inhaber der Vorzugsaktien der Kategorie A mit der Mehrheit der anwesenden Stimmen (die "Sonderversammlung").

 |  |

5. The issuance of any preferred shares as well as the modification and cancellation, respectively, of this Article 3b requires the approval of a special meeting of the Series A Preferred Shares with a majority of the votes present at the meeting (the "Special Meeting"). In addition, approval by the Special Meeting is required for (a) the approval of a merger which would result in a holder of a Series A Preferred Share receiving less than 10 (ten) USD (United States Dollars) per Series A Preferred Share or (b) in case of resolutions by a General Meeting of Shareholders being held in the context of a public tender offer for all or part of the shares of the company, to the extent that a holder of a Series A Preferred Share would receive less than 10 (ten) USD (United States Dollars) per Series A Preferred Share.
