proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party
apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions

by communicating to the respective shareholders of Bridge Bancorp and DCB its recommendation (and including such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus) that, in the case of Bridge Bancorp, the shareholders of Bridge Bancorp approve this Agreement
(the &ldquo;<B>Bridge Bancorp Board Recommendation</B>&rdquo;), and in the case of DCB, that the shareholders of DCB approve this

receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good
faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue
to make the Bridge Bancorp Board Recommendation or the DCB Board Recommendation, as applicable, such Board of Directors may, in
the case of Bridge Bancorp prior to the receipt of the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote, and in the case of DCB prior to the receipt
of the Requisite DCB Vote, submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event such Board of Directors may communicate the
basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment
or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided that such Board of Directors may not take any actions under this
sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least three (3) business days&rsquo; prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including,
in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity
of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail
such other event or circumstances) and (B) at the end of such notice period, takes into account any amendment or modification to
this Agreement proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the Bridge Bancorp Board Recommendation or DCB Board Recommendation,
as the case may be. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes
of this Section 8.2 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 8.2. Bridge Bancorp or DCB shall adjourn
or postpone the Bridge Bancorp Meeting or the DCB Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock or DCB Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting
DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Requisite DCB Vote or the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
immediately preceding sentence), DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as applicable, shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies from its shareholders in order to obtain the Requisite DCB Vote or the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote, respectively. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the obligation to adjourn or postpone such meeting as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the Bridge Bancorp Meeting shall
be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Bridge Bancorp at the Bridge Bancorp Meeting and (y) the
DCB Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of DCB at the DCB Meeting, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Bridge Bancorp or DCB of such obligation.</P>

the Shareholder&rsquo;s obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) this Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by DCB, constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in
accordance with its terms, and no other action is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder
or the performance of his or her obligations hereunder; (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict
with or violate any law or result in any breach of or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse

of, or result in the creation of a lien on any of the Shares pursuant to, any agreement or other instrument or obligation binding
upon the Shareholder or the Shares (including under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of BB), nor require any authorization,
consent or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity except for, filings with the SEC of such reports under the Exchange
Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation,
any filing required under Section 13 or Section 16 under the Exchange Act; (d) the Shareholder beneficially owns (as such term

permitted by this Agreement, under applicable federal or state securities laws, under the Shareholder&rsquo;s organizational documents
or customary liens pursuant to the terms of any custody or similar agreement applicable to Shares held in brokerage accounts);

may be deemed to have beneficial ownership, but not the voting authority, with respect to 599,928 Shares (the &ldquo;<U>Shared
Voting Shares</U>&rdquo;), and the Shareholder will use its best efforts to recommend to such parties with voting authority that
it vote such Shared Voting Shares in the same manner as the Shareholder is obligated to vote the other Shares pursuant to this
Agreement. The Shareholder agrees that the Shareholder shall not take any action that would make any representation or warranty
of the Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing, impairing, delaying or adversely affecting
the performance by the Shareholder of his or her obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees, without further consideration,
to execute and deliver such additional documents and to take such further actions as are necessary or reasonably requested by DCB
to confirm and assure the rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement. The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that
DCB is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder and
