ARTICLE III 
 CONVERSION OF SHARES

  



   | 3.1.| Conversion of DCB Common Stock; Merger Consideration.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Bridge Bancorp, DCB or the holders of any of the shares of DCB
Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following
terms:

  



  

3.1.1.  Each share of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding following the Effective Time and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

  



  

3.1.2.  Each Exception Share shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid or provided with
respect thereto.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

3.1.3.  Subject to Section 3.1.4, each share of DCB Common Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Exception Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.648 (the
"Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Bridge Bancorp Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration"). Each share of DCB
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article III shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and each certificate previously representing any such shares of DCB Common
Stock (each, an "Old Certificate", it being understood that any reference
herein to "Old Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry
account statements relating to the ownership of shares of DCB Common Stock)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (x) the
Merger Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, this Section 3.1.3
and the other terms of this Article III, (y) cash in lieu of fractional
shares that the shares of DCB Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 3.1.3
and Section 3.1.4, without any interest thereon, and (z) any dividends or
distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.3.4, in the case of each of the foregoing, without interest and
subject to all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance with Section
3.3.8. Old Certificates previously representing shares of DCB Common Stock
shall be exchanged for evidence of shares in book-entry form or, at Bridge
Bancorp's option, certificates (collectively, referred to herein as "New
Certificates"), representing the Merger Consideration (together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of
such Old Certificates in accordance with Section 3.3.1, without any interest
thereon and subject to all applicable withholding of Tax in accordance with
Section 3.3.8.

  



  

3.1.4.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Bridge Bancorp Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share interests, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Bridge Bancorp. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, Bridge Bancorp shall, following the Effective
Time, pay to each former holder of DCB Common Stock who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock, an
amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, determined
by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock that such
holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section
3.1.3 and (ii) the Bridge Bancorp Closing Price (the "Fractional Share
Consideration"). For purposes of determining any fractional share interest,
all shares of DCB Common Stock owned by a DCB shareholder shall be
combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of Bridge
Bancorp Common Stock issuable to such DCB shareholder.

  



  

3.1.5.  If, prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the outstanding shares of Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock or DCB Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number or
kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a
recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, reverse stock
split or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange
Ratio to give holders of DCB Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

   | 3.2.| Conversion DCB Preferred Stock.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Bridge Bancorp, DCB or the holder of any securities of Bridge
Bancorp or DCB, each share of DCB Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of DCB Preferred
Stock owned by DCB as treasury stock or otherwise (in each case other than in
a fiduciary or agency capacity for another Person) shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive a share of a newly created series of
preferred stock of Bridge Bancorp having the powers, preferences and rights
in the Restated COI (all shares of such newly created series,
collectively, the "New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock") and, upon such
conversion, the DCB Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.

  



   | 3.3.| Procedures for Exchange of DCB Common Stock and DCB
Preferred Stock.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

3.3.1.   _Exchange of Certificates_. Prior to the Effective Time, Bridge
Bancorp shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to DCB

Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old
Certificates (for purposes of this Section 3.3 Old Certificates shall be
deemed to include certificates or book-entry account statements representing
DCB Preferred Stock) representing shares of DCB Common Stock or DCB Preferred
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1 or the New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
3.2, as applicable, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration that such holder of DCB Common Stock shall have become entitled
to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section 3.1.3, and any cash in
lieu payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
Section 3.1.4, and any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to
Section 3.3.4, or the New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 3.2 and any dividends or distributions to be
paid pursuant to Section 3.3.4. From and after the Effective Time, upon
proper surrender of the Old Certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such properly completed letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of
such Old Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i)(A) a New Certificate representing the Merger Consideration to
which such holder of DCB Common Stock shall have become entitled to
receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section 3.1.3, and (B) a check
representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old
Certificate pursuant to Section 3.1.4 and (y) any dividends or distributions
that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old

dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.3.4, and the Old Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates or any dividends
payable under Section 3.3.4. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.3.1, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
number of whole shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock or shares of New Bridge
Bancorp Preferred Stock which the shares of DCB Common Stock or DCB Preferred
Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section
3.3.1 and 3.3.4.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

3.3.2.  The Exchange Agent shall accept such Old Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If any New
Certificate representing shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock or New Bridge
Bancorp Preferred Stock, as applicable, is to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock or New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock, as applicable, in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

representing the aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to
Section 3.1.3 and exchanged pursuant to Section 3.3.1 and the shares of New
Bridge Bancorp Preferred stock to be issued pursuant to Section 3.2 and (b)
cash in an amount sufficient to pay any cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock (such cash and New Certificates described in
the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"; provided that no such investment income or losses thereon
shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable, or the shares of New
Bridge Bancorp Preferred stock issuable, to the holders of Old Certificates.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be solely
for the benefit of and paid to Bridge Bancorp.

  



  

3.3.4.   _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The
holder of an Old Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and
outstanding DCB Common Stock or DCB Preferred Stock shall have no rights,
after the Effective Time, with respect to such DCB Common Stock or DCB
Preferred Stock except to surrender the Old Certificate in exchange for the
Merger Consideration and the New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock, as
applicable, as provided in this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared after the Effective Time with respect to Bridge Bancorp Common Stock
or the New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Old Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3. After the surrender of
an Old Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock or the New
Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old
Certificate.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

3.3.5.   _Closing of Transfer Books_. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of DCB of the DCB Common
Stock or the DCB Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration or the New
Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock, as applicable (together with any dividends or
distributions payable with respect thereto in accordance with Section 3.3.4
and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor in
accordance with Section 3.1.4), subject to all applicable withholding of Tax
in accordance 3.3.8, that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is
entitled to, as provided in this Section 3.3.

  



  

3.3.6.   _Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of DCB for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be paid to Bridge Bancorp. Any former shareholders of DCB
who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to Bridge Bancorp for payment of the Merger Consideration or the shares
of New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock (together with any dividends or
distributions payable with respect thereto in accordance with Section 3.3.4
and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor in
accordance with Section 3.1.4) in respect of each former share of DCB Common
Stock or DCB Preferred Stock, as applicable, such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Bridge Bancorp, DCB, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of DCB Common Stock or DCB Preferred Stock for
any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

3.3.7.   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Old
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
Bridge Bancorp, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the
Exchange Agent or Bridge Bancorp may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnification against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent or Bridge Bancorp, as applicable,
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration or shares of New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock, as
applicable (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

3.3.8.   _Withholding._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Bridge Bancorp shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration, and
shares of New Bridge Bancorp Preferred Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Article III or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of DCB Common Stock or DCB Preferred Stock such
amounts as Bridge Bancorp (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
Bridge Bancorp or the Exchange Agent, and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the DCB Common Stock
or DCB Preferred Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding were
made by Bridge Bancorp or the Exchange Agent.

   | 4.9.| Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

4.9.1.  DCB and each DCB Subsidiary has good and, as to real property,
marketable title, to all material assets and properties owned by DCB or any
DCB Subsidiary in the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the DCB Regulatory
Reports and in the DCB Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto
(except to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of
in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such balance sheets),
subject to no material Liens, except (i) those items which secure liabilities
for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or
other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, or any transaction
by DCB acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory Liens for amounts not
yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith, (iii) non-monetary
Liens affecting real property which do not adversely affect the value or use
of such real property, and (iv) those described and reflected in the DCB
Financial Statements. DCB and each DCB Subsidiary, as lessee, has the right
under valid and existing leases of real and personal properties used by DCB or
such DCB Subsidiary in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all
such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them.

  



  

4.9.2.  With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which DCB or
any DCB Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to
resell, if any, DCB or any DCB Subsidiary has a Lien (which to DCB's Knowledge
is a valid, perfected first lien) in the securities or other collateral
securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or
exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

  



  

4.9.3.  DCB and each DCB Subsidiary are insured with reputable insurers
against such risks and in such amounts that management of DCB reasonably
determined to be prudent, sufficient and consistent with industry practice,
and DCB and each DCB Subsidiary are in compliance in all material respects
with their insurance policies. Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary has received
notice from any insurance carrier during the past two (2) years that (i) such
insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated, or (ii) premium costs (other than with respect to health or
disability insurance) with respect to such policies of insurance will be
materially increased. Except as disclosed in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3,
there are presently no material claims pending under such policies of
insurance and no notices have been given by DCB or any DCB Subsidiary under
such policies (other than with respect to health or disability insurance).
All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect, and
within the last three years DCB and each DCB Subsidiary has received each type
of insurance coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has
not been denied indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of
its insurance policies. DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3 identifies all material
policies of insurance maintained by DCB and the DCB Subsidiaries as of the
date of this Agreement.

Except as set forth in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.10, there is no suit,
action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to DCB's Knowledge,
threatened against or affecting DCB or any DCB Subsidiary (and to DCB's
Knowledge there are no facts or circumstances that reasonably could be
expected to be the basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1) that
involves a Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2) that, individually
or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to DCB or any such DCB
Subsidiary, would be (A) material to its business, or (B) reasonably likely
to prevent or delay it from performing its obligations under, or
consummating the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. There is no
injunction, order, award, judgment, settlement, decree or
regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered into by DCB or any DCB
Subsidiary (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates) or to which their respective
assets are subject.

  



   | 4.11.| Compliance With Applicable Law.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

4.11.1.  Except as set forth in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.11.1, to DCB's
Knowledge, DCB and each DCB Subsidiary is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws,
regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees applicable to
it, its properties, assets and deposits, its business, and its conduct of
business and its relationship with its employees, including, without
limitation, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act, the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending
Act, Regulation Z, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, any regulations promulgated by the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and all other applicable fair lending
laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices and to the
origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer loans, and including
laws relating to the privacy and security of data or information that
constitutes personal data or personal information under applicable law
("Personal Data"). The Boards of Directors of DCB and Dime Community Bank
have adopted and DCB and Dime Community Bank have implemented an anti-
money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures, that has not been
declared ineffective by any Governmental Entity and that meets the
requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder.

  



  

4.11.2.  Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary has any Knowledge of, nor has DCB
or any DCB Subsidiary been advised of, or has any reason to believe that any
facts or circumstances exist, which would cause DCB or any DCB Subsidiary: (a)
to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the CRA, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA
purposes by Bank Regulators of lower than "satisfactory"; (b) to be deemed to
be operating in violation of the federal Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, and
its implementing regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, any order issued with respect to anti-money
laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or
regulation; or (c) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the
applicable requirements contained in any federal and state privacy or data
security laws and regulations. Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary is a party
to any agreement with any individual or group regarding CRA matters.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

4.11.3.  DCB (including Dime Community Bank) maintains a written information
privacy and security program that maintains reasonable measures to protect
the privacy, confidentiality and security of all Personal Data against any (i)
loss or misuse of Personal Data, (ii) unauthorized or unlawful operations
performed upon Personal Data, or (iii) other act or omission that compromises
the security or confidentiality of Personal Data (clauses (i) through (iii),
a "Security Breach"). To the knowledge of DCB, neither DCB nor any DCB
Subsidiary has experienced any Security Breach that would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
DCB. To the knowledge of DCB, there are no data security or other
technological vulnerabilities with respect to its information technology
systems or networks that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on DCB.

  



  

4.11.4.  DCB and each DCB Subsidiary has all material permits, licenses,
authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted, except where
the failure to hold such permits, licensees, authorizations, orders or
approvals, or the failure to make such filings, applications or registrations
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on DCB or Dime Community Bank; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect in all material respects and, to the Knowledge of DCB,
no suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order
or approval is threatened or will result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining Regulatory
Approvals.

  



  

4.11.5.  Except as set forth in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.11.5, neither DCB
nor any DCB Subsidiary is, or since January 1, 2017 has been, subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or a party to
any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with,
or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or subject to
any order or directive by, or ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, any
Bank Regulator. Subject to Section 12.9, and except as set forth in DCB
Disclosure Schedule 4.11.5, since January 1, 2017, neither DCB nor any DCB
Subsidiary has received any written notification or, to DCB's Knowledge, any
other communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that DCB or any DCB
Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes, regulations
or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke
any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization which is material
to DCB or any DCB Subsidiary; (iii) requiring, or threatening to require, DCB
or any DCB Subsidiary, or indicating that DCB or any DCB Subsidiary may
be required, to enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum
of understanding or any other agreement with any federal or state
governmental agency or authority which is charged with the supervision or
regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of bank deposits restricting
or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in any material respect the
operations of DCB or any DCB Subsidiary, including without limitation any
restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting
or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the
operations of DCB or any DCB Subsidiary, including without limitation any
restriction on the payment of dividends. The most recent regulatory rating
given to Dime Community Bank as to compliance with the Community Reinvestment
Act ("CRA") is "Satisfactory" or better.

4.12.1.  DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.1 includes a list of all existing
bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement

time off policies and other material benefit policies and procedures), fringe

consultant or director or former director of DCB or any DCB Subsidiary
participates or to which any such employee, consultant or director is a party
or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits (the "DCB Compensation and
Benefit Plans"). Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary has any commitment to
create any additional DCB Compensation and Benefit Plan or to materially
modify, change or renew any existing DCB Compensation and Benefit Plan (any
modification or change that materially increases the cost of such plans would
be deemed material), except as required by applicable law or
Governmental Entity or to maintain the qualified status thereof. DCB has made
available to Bridge Bancorp true and correct copies of the DCB Compensation
and Benefit Plans.

  



  

4.12.2.  Except as disclosed in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.2, each DCB

material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act ("HIPAA") and any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and any other applicable law
have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions

Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is established pursuant to IRS-
approved prototype or volume submitter documents or has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, and to DCB's Knowledge there are no facts
or circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of DCB, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the DCB
Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). DCB
has not engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect
to any DCB Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
subject DCB to a material unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  



  

4.12.3.   Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary has ever maintained or
contributed to or has any liability under a DCB Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

as set forth in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.5, any retiree death benefits
under any DCB Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by
Section 4980B of the Code. Except as set forth in DCB Disclosure Schedule
4.12.5, there has been no communication to employees by DCB or any DCB
Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such
employees retiree health, life insurance, or disability insurance, or any
retiree death benefits.

  



  

4.12.6.  Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary maintains any DCB Compensation
and Benefit Plans covering employees who are not United States residents.

  



  

4.12.7.  With respect to each DCB Compensation and Benefit Plan, if
applicable, DCB has provided or made available to Bridge Bancorp copies of
the: (A) trust instruments and insurance contracts; (B) two most recent Forms
5500 filed with the IRS; (C) most recent actuarial reports and financial
statements; (D) most recent summary plan description; (E) most recent
determination letter issued by the IRS; (F) any Form 5300, 5310 or Form 5330

and 401(m) tests).

  



  

4.12.8.  Except as provided in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.8, the
consummation of the Merger will not (alone or in combination with any other
event, including, without limitation, any termination of employment or service
at any time prior to or following the Effective Time) (A) entitle any
employee, consultant or director to any payment or benefit (including
severance pay, change in control benefit, or similar compensation) or any
increase in compensation, (B) entitle any employee or independent
contractor to terminate any plan, agreement or arrangement without cause and
continue to accrue future benefits thereunder, or result in the vesting or
acceleration of any benefits under any DCB Compensation and Benefit Plan, (C)
result in any increase in benefits payable under any DCB Compensation and
Benefit Plan, (D) entitle any current or former employee, director or
independent contractor of DCB to any actual or deemed payment (or benefit)
which could reasonably be construed to constitute an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code).

  



  

4.12.9.  Except as disclosed in DCB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.9, neither DCB
nor any DCB Subsidiary maintains any compensation plans, programs or
arrangements under which any payment is reasonably likely to become non-
deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a result of
the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder, it being understood that DCB makes no representation or warranty
regarding the effect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any actions taken by Bridge Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
on the deductibility of any compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and
the regulations issued thereunder.

4.12.10.  Except as disclosed in DCB Disclosure Schedule
4.12.10, all "nonqualified deferred compensation plans" (within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code) are exempt from, or in material compliance with,

issued thereunder.

sponsors any employee benefit plan or has entered into an agreement or
arrangement that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health
or medical, disability or life insurance benefits for retired or former
directors, employees or their dependents, except as required by Section 4980B
of the Code.

   | 4.14.| Environmental Matters.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

4.14.1.  To the Knowledge of DCB, neither the conduct nor operation of its
business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or
operated by DCB (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency
capacity), or on which it holds a Lien, results or resulted in a violation of
any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a material
liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon DCB or any DCB
Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of DCB, no condition has existed or event
has occurred with respect to any such property that, with notice or the
passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any material
liability to DCB or any DCB Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental Laws.
Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary has during the past five years received
any written notice from any Person or Governmental Entity that DCB or the
operation or condition of any property ever owned, operated, or held as
collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by DCB or any DCB Subsidiary is
currently in violation of or otherwise is alleged to have liability under any
Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern
(including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility)
for the cleanup or other remediation of any Materials of Environmental
Concern at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property) for which a
material liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon DCB or any DCB
Subsidiary.

  



  

   

32

 



    



  

4.14.2.  There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to DCB's Knowledge,
threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other forum against DCB
or any DCB Subsidiary, (x) for alleged noncompliance (including by any
predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (y) relating
to the presence of or release into the environment of any Materials of
Environmental Concern, whether or not occurring at or on a site owned, leased
or operated by DCB or any DCB Subsidiary; and

losses reflected in DCB's unaudited (and any audited) consolidated balance
sheets for periods ending after December 31, 2019 as filed in any DCB
Securities Documents, were in the reasonable opinion of DCB's management
(i) adequate to meet all reasonably anticipated loan and lease losses, net of
recoveries related to loans previously charged off as of those dates, (ii)
consistent with GAAP and reasonable and sound banking practices, and (iii) in
conformance with recommendations and comments in reports of examination in
all material respects.

interest days or more and still accruing; (4) classified as troubled debt
restructurings; (5) that as of the date of this Agreement are classified as
"Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard,"
"Doubtful," "Loss,"  "Classified," "Criticized," "Watch List" or words of
similar import, together with the principal amount of and accrued and unpaid
interest on each such Loan and the identity of the obligor thereunder, (6)
where, during the past three years, the interest rate terms have been reduced
and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the
agreement under which the loan was originally created due to concerns
regarding the borrower's ability to pay in accordance with such initial
terms, or (7) where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection
therewith; and (E) all assets classified by Dime Community Bank as real
estate acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure, including in-

limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).

4.15.5.  DCB and each DCB Subsidiary has good and marketable title to all
securities owned by it, free and clear of any Liens, except to the extent
such securities are pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure
obligations of DCB or such DCB Subsidiary. Such securities are valued on the
books of DCB in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. DCB and each
DCB Subsidiary employs investment, securities, risk management and other
policies, practices and procedures which DCB believes are prudent and
reasonable.

  



  

4.15.6.  Neither DCB nor any DCB Subsidiary is now, or has been since January
1, 2017, subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other contract or
other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan
purchase commitment from, any Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator relating
to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer loans.

  



  

4.15.7.  None of the agreements pursuant to which DCB or any of its
Subsidiaries has sold loans or pools of loans or participations in loans or

therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such
loan.

5.11.2.  Neither Bridge Bancorp nor any Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary has any
Knowledge of, nor has Bridge Bancorp or any Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary been

would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Bridge Bancorp. To the knowledge of Bridge
Bancorp, there are no data security or other technological vulnerabilities

Material Adverse Effect on Bridge Bancorp.

permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all

Bank Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted except where the
failure to hold such permits, licensees, authorizations, orders or approvals,
or the failure to make such filings, applications or registrations would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Bridge Bancorp or BNB Bank; all such permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect
in all material respects and, to the Knowledge of Bridge Bancorp, no
suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or
approval is threatened or will result from the consummation of the

verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for
the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the
other party, access, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by either
Bridge Bancorp or DCB with respect to in-person access in light of COVID-19
concerns, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each
shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute the conversion
or consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during
such period, each of Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or
documents that Bridge Bancorp or DCB, as the case may be, is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, biweekly reports of all closed loans. Neither
Bridge Bancorp nor DCB nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Bridge Bancorp's or DCB's,
as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.
Additionally, in order to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the integration of the business and operations of the
parties, and subject to each party's confidentiality obligations, DCB and
Bridge Bancorp shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective telecommunications and data processing service providers
to cooperate and assist in connection with preparation for an electronic and
systematic conversion of all applicable data regarding DCB's and Bridge
Bancorp's systems of telecommunications and electronic data processing.
Electronic and systematic conversion shall occur at such time as determined
by both DCB and Bridge Bancorp in their reasonable discretion and as
mutually agreed between the parties.

7.1.2.  Each of Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall hold all information
furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such
party's Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 7.1.1 in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions

their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein.

  



  

7.1.3.  Each party shall promptly inform the other party upon receiving
notice of any legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings,
demands, notices, audits or investigations (by any Governmental Entity,
including federal, state or local commission, agency or board) relating to
the alleged liability of it or any Subsidiary.

  



   | 7.2.| Maintenance of Insurance.  
---|---|---

   | 7.3.| Advise of Changes.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall each promptly advise the other of any effect,
change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development (i)
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or its Subsidiaries or (ii)
that it believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations,
covenants or agreements contained herein, whether or not such breach could be
expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a
condition in Article IX; provided, that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this Section 7.3 or the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 9.2 or 9.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 9.2 or 9.3 to be satisfied; and
provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.3 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such
notice.

  



  

   

63

 



    



   | 7.4.| Consents and Approvals of Third Parties; Best Efforts  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each of Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall use its best efforts, and shall cause
each of their Subsidiaries to use its best efforts, to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, Bridge Bancorp seeking approval to become a
Freddie Mac sub-servicer. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each party agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
that a party determines that a condition to its obligation to complete the
Merger cannot be fulfilled by the other party and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly advise the other party.

  



   | 7.5.| Acquisition Proposals.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

7.5.1.  (a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) engage or participate in
any negotiations with any Person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or
participate in any discussions with, any Person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent,
commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (whether written or oral,
binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
and entered into in accordance with this Section 7.5) in connection with or
relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote, in the case or Bridge Bancorp, or the
Requisite DCB Vote, in the case of DCB, a party receives an unsolicited _bona
fide_  written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be
furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in
such negotiations or discussions with the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such
actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _that_ , prior to
furnishing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided
pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal on
terms no less favorable to such party than the Confidentiality Agreement,
which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such Person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with such party. Each party will, and will cause
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Person other than DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as applicable,
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each party will promptly (within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other party following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms
and conditions of and the identity of the Person making such inquiry
or Acquisition Proposal), will provide the other party with an unredacted
copy of any such Acquisition Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or
other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to
or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Each party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality
or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition
Proposal" shall mean, with respect to Bridge Bancorp or DCB, as
applicable, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of
interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its
Subsidiaries or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the party, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class
of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of the consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the party.

  



  

7.5.2.  (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or
its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under
the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that
such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

   | 7.6.| Additional Agreements.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

If, at any time after the Effective Time, Bridge Bancorp shall consider or be
advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other
acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in Bridge Bancorp its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of DCB, or (ii) otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, DCB and its officers and directors shall be
deemed to have granted to Bridge Bancorp an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver, in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or
desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Bridge
Bancorp its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of DCB or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of Bridge Bancorp are authorized in
the name of DCB or otherwise to take any and all such action.

  



   | 7.7.| Shareholder Litigation.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each party shall give the other party prompt notice of any shareholder
litigation against such party or its directors or officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall give the other party
the opportunity to participate (at such other's party's expense) in the
defense or settlement of any such litigation. Each party shall give the other
the right to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by
such party in connection with any such litigation, and will in good faith take
such comments into account. No party shall agree to settle any such
litigation without the other party's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
that the other party shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement
which does not include a full release of such other party and its Affiliates
or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the Effective
Time upon the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates.

  



   | 7.8.| Employee Benefits.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

7.8.1.  Commencing at the Effective Time and thereafter during the
periods specified below, Bridge Bancorp shall provide employees of Bridge
Bancorp or a Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary, and employees of DCB or a DCB
Subsidiary who at the Effective Time become employees of Bridge Bancorp or a
Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary (the "Continuing Employees") with the following
compensation and benefits: (i) for the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, (A) a base
salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the
base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) annual cash and long-
term incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the annual cash and long-term incentive compensation
opportunities, in the aggregate, provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) for the period
commencing on the Effective Time until such time as the Surviving Corporation
shall, subject to applicable law and the terms of such plans, modify any
Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plans or DCB Benefit Plans or adopt new benefit plans
with respect to Continuing Employees (collectively, the "New Benefit Plans"),
with employee benefits under the Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plans or DCB Benefit
Plans in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
such benefit plans as may be mutually agreed) with respect to Continuing
Employees of each of Bridge Bancorp and DCB (and their respective
Subsidiaries), respectively, who were covered by such plans as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _that_ for the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the one year anniversary of the Closing
Date, such employee benefits provided to Continuing Employees shall be no
less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to
similarly situated Continuing Employees of Bridge Bancorp. Prior to the
Closing Date, DCB and Bridge Bancorp shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating
and analyzing the Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plans and DCB Benefit Plans with a
view towards developing appropriate New Benefit Plans with respect to
Continuing Employees of Bridge Bancorp and DCB, which New Benefit Plans will,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, and among other things, (A) treat
similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into
account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities, and (B) not discriminate between employees who
were covered by Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those
covered by DCB Benefit Plans, on the other hand, at the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bridge Bancorp and DCB agree that any
Continuing Employee of Bridge Bancorp or DCB who, during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
is involuntarily terminated other than for cause by the Surviving Corporation
or any of its respective Subsidiaries will be provided with severance pay and
benefits pursuant to a severance program to be mutually agreed between Bridge
Bancorp and DCB prior to the Effective Time.

7.8.2.  For purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting (except
not for purposes of benefit accrual, including any benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan, or to the extent that such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits) under the Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plans, DCB
Benefit Plans and the New Benefit Plans, service with or credited by Bridge
Bancorp, DCB or any of their respective Subsidiaries or predecessors for
Continuing Employees or continuing employees of Bridge Bancorp or
its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with Bridge Bancorp to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous DCB
Benefit Plan or Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time. With
respect to any DCB Benefit Plan, Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan or New Benefit
Plan in which any employees of Bridge Bancorp or DCB (or their Subsidiaries)
prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time, and in which such employees did not participate prior to
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply
under the analogous Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan or DCB Benefit Plan, as the
case may be, and (ii) provide each such employee and his or her eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time (or, if later, prior to the time such employee commenced
participation in the New Benefit Plan) under an Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan or
DCB Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous DCB or Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any DCB Benefit
Plan, Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan in which such employee
first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

  



  

7.8.3.  The Surviving Corporation agrees to honor, in accordance with
their terms, all Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plans and DCB Benefit Plans.

  



  

7.8.4.  If requested by Bridge Bancorp in writing delivered to DCB not
less than ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of DCB (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to
terminate the DCB KSOP Plan (the "DCB KSOP Plan"), effective as of the day
prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective
Time. If Bridge Bancorp requests that the DCB KSOP Plan be terminated, (i)
DCB shall provide Bridge Bancorp with evidence that such plan has been
terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable
review and comment by Bridge Bancorp) not later than two (2) days immediately
preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by Bridge Bancorp or one of its Subsidiaries (the
"Bridge Bancorp 401(k) Plan"), it being agreed that there shall be no gap in
participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan. Bridge Bancorp and
DCB shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments
to the DCB KSOP Plan and/or the Bridge Bancorp 401(k) Plan, to permit the
Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions to the Bridge Bancorp
401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), but excluding loans, in an amount equal to
the full account balance distributed to such employee from the DCB KSOP Plan.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

7.8.5.  Bridge Bancorp shall use reasonable best efforts to submit to
Bridge Bancorp's shareholders for approval, at either the Bridge Bancorp
Meeting or Bridge Bancorp's next regularly scheduled shareholder meeting, a
proposal to either (i) amend the existing Bridge Bancorp Stock Benefit Plans
or (ii) establish a new equity compensation plan, to increase the number of
shares of the Surviving Corporation that are available for future equity
grants to employees of the Surviving Corporation, or such other similar plan
as the Board of Directors of Bridge shall deem reasonably appropriate. DCB and
Bridge Bancorp shall together cooperate in good faith to determine the
compensation arrangements for key employees, other than the Officers (as
defined below) and Kenneth Mahon who are separately addressed in Section
7.18.2 below, including with respect to any base salaries, bonuses (retention,
transactional or otherwise), severance, and equity compensation.

  



  

7.8.6.  Other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Bridge Bancorp Bylaws Amendment, nothing in this Agreement shall confer
upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of Bridge Bancorp or DCB or
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates any right to continue in the employ
or service of the Surviving Corporation, DCB, Bridge Bancorp or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, DCB, Bridge Bancorp or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any
employee, officer, director or consultant of Bridge Bancorp or DCB or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause. Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any DCB Benefit Plan, Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or
(ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular DCB
Benefit Plan, Bridge Bancorp Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 12.4, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant of Bridge Bancorp or DCB or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  



  

7.8.7.  The parties will coordinate all actions necessary in order to
fully and timely comply with any and all requirements of both the federal
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 and any state
specific WARN Act statutes (collectively, the  "WARN Act"), including
providing notices to their employees.

  



   | 7.9.| Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

7.9.1.  From and after the Effective Time, Bridge Bancorp, as the
Surviving Corporation, shall indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance
expenses as incurred, in each case to the extent (subject to applicable law)
such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by DCB pursuant
to the DCB Certificate of Incorporation, the DCB Bylaws, the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of DCB and any indemnification
agreements in existence as of the date hereof, each present and former
director, officer or employee of DCB and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"DCB Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising
out of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of
DCB or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ in the case of advancement of expenses,
any DCB Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
DCB Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

7.9.2.  For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by DCB (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time. In lieu of the foregoing, Bridge Bancorp or
DCB, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Bridge Bancorp, may
(and at the request of Bridge Bancorp, DCB shall use its reasonable best
efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail"
policy under DCB's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence.

  



  

7.9.3.  The obligations of Bridge Bancorp as the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 7.9 shall not be terminated or modified after the
Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any DCB Indemnified Party
without the prior written consent of the affected DCB Indemnified Party.

  



  

7.9.4.  The provisions of this Section 7.9 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each DCB Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other Person or engages in
any similar transaction, then in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.9.

  



   | 7.10.| Public Announcements.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

DCB and Bridge Bancorp agree that the initial press release with respect to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a release mutually
agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties agrees that no
public release or announcement or statement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as required by
applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental
Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the
other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on,
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance or (ii) for such
releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such
releases, announcement or statements made after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with this Section 7.10.

  



  

   

68

 



    



   | 7.11.| Change of Method.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

DCB and Bridge Bancorp shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure
of effecting the combination of DCB and Bridge Bancorp (including the
provisions of Articles II and III), if and to the extent they both deem such
change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided, however, that no
such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of
shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock received by holders of DCB Common Stock
in exchange for each share of DCB Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of DCB's shareholders or Bridge Bancorp's shareholders pursuant to
this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of DCB or Bridge
Bancorp pursuant to this Agreement, or (iv) materially impede or delay the

---|---|--- 
  



  

If either DCB or Bridge Bancorp shall have failed to obtain the Requisite DCB
Vote or the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote at the duly convened DCB Meeting or
Bridge Bancorp Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best
efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions provided for herein
(it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or
change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the consideration
to be issued to holders of the capital stock of DCB as provided for in this
Agreement, or any term that would adversely affect the Tax treatment of the

contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Restriction now or hereafter
in effect. If any Takeover Restriction may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Restriction on any of the transactions contemplated by this

DCB and Bridge Bancorp agree that, in order to most effectively compensate
and retain those officers and directors of DCB subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "DCB Insiders"), both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that DCB Insiders not
be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the
conversion of shares of DCB Common Stock and DCB Stock Options in the Merger,
and for compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this

Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case
of DCB) any dispositions of DCB Common Stock or DCB Stock Options by the DCB
Insiders, and (in the case of Bridge Bancorp) any acquisitions of Bridge
Bancorp Common Stock by any DCB Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the

coordinate with the other with respect to the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock and DCB Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of DCB Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in respect of any quarter with
respect to their shares of DCB Common Stock and any shares of Bridge Bancorp
Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

  



   | 7.16.| Assumption of DCB Debt.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Effective as of the Effective Time, Bridge Bancorp shall enter into a

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Bridge Bancorp, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of DCB or any DCB
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give DCB, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Bridge Bancorp or any Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary prior

its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and DCB shall furnish all information
concerning DCB and the holders of DCB Common Stock as may be reasonably

documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings and
in the case of the applications, notices, petitions and filings in respect of

as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Governmental Entities. Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall have the right to review
in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on,
in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity, including the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus, the
Merger Registration Statement and any other filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and

any request for information and resolve any objection that may be asserted by

consent of the other party), to take any action, or commit to take any action,
or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining
Regulatory Approvals or the approval of any Government Entity the that would

the Merger (a "Burdensome Condition").

  



  

8.1.4.  Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall, upon request, furnish each other

their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

8.1.5.  Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Bank Regulator or other Governmental
Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe

be obtained, or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.

  



  

   

73

 



    



   | 8.2.| Shareholder Approvals.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each of Bridge Bancorp and DCB shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the
"Bridge Bancorp Meeting" and the "DCB Meeting," respectively) to be held as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Merger Registration Statement is
declared effective, for the purpose of obtaining (a) the Requisite DCB Vote
and the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger, (b) the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote required to
amend the Bridge Bancorp Certificate of Incorporation, and (c) if so desired
and mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought
before a meeting of shareholders in connection with the approval of a merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and each of DCB and Bridge
Bancorp shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur
as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date. Each of Bridge
Bancorp and DCB and their respective Boards of Directors shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Bridge Bancorp and
DCB, as applicable, the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote and the Requisite DCB
Vote, as applicable, including by communicating to the respective
shareholders of Bridge Bancorp and DCB its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus) that, in the case of
Bridge Bancorp, the shareholders of Bridge Bancorp approve this
Agreement (the "Bridge Bancorp Board Recommendation"), and in the case of
DCB, that the shareholders of DCB approve this Agreement (the "DCB Board
Recommendation"), Bridge Bancorp and each of Bridge Bancorp and DCB and their
respective Boards of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to the other party the Bridge Bancorp Board
Recommendation, in the case of Bridge Bancorp, or the DCB Board
Recommendation, in the case of DCB, (ii) fail to make the Bridge Bancorp
Board Recommendation, in the case of Bridge Bancorp, or the DCB Board
Recommendation, in the case of DCB, in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus,
(iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly
announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly and without qualification (A)
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm the Bridge Bancorp
Board Recommendation, in the case of Bridge Bancorp, or the DCB Board
Recommendation, in the case of DCB, in each case within ten (10) business days
(or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Bridge Bancorp Meeting
or the DCB Meeting, as applicable) after an Acquisition Proposal is made
public or any request by the other party to do so, or (v) publicly propose to
do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing a "Recommendation Change").
However, subject to Section 11.1 and Section 11.2, if the Board of Directors
of Bridge Bancorp or DCB, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in
good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the Bridge
Bancorp Board Recommendation or the DCB Board Recommendation, as applicable,
such Board of Directors may, in the case of Bridge Bancorp prior to the
receipt of the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote, and in the case of DCB prior to
the receipt of the Requisite DCB Vote, submit this Agreement to its
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event such Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
provided that such Board of Directors may not take any actions under
this sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least three (3) business
days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is
taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable
detail such other event or circumstances) and (B) at the end of such notice
period, takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or
continue to make the Bridge Bancorp Board Recommendation or DCB Board
Recommendation, as the case may be. Any material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this
Section 8.2 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this
Section 8.2. Bridge Bancorp or DCB shall adjourn or postpone the Bridge
Bancorp Meeting or the DCB Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for
which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of
Bridge Bancorp Common Stock or DCB Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as applicable, has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
DCB Vote or the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including the immediately preceding sentence),
DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as applicable, shall continue to use reasonable best
efforts to solicit proxies from its shareholders in order to obtain the
Requisite DCB Vote or the Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote, respectively.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the
obligation to adjourn or postpone such meeting as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, (x) the Bridge Bancorp Meeting shall be convened
and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Bridge Bancorp at
the Bridge Bancorp Meeting and (y) the DCB Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of DCB at the DCB Meeting,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Bridge Bancorp
or DCB of such obligation.

terminating party to the other party provided, however, that neither party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.1.2 unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all
other such breaches, would entitle the terminating party not to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.1 (in the case of a
breach of a representation or warranty by DCB) or Section 9.3.1 (in the case
of a breach of a representation or warranty by Bridge Bancorp);

  



  

11.1.3.  By the Board of Directors of either Bridge Bancorp or DCB (

covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other
party, which failure (i) by its nature cannot be cured prior to the
Termination Date or (ii) shall not have been cured within 45 days after
written notice of such failure by the terminating party to the other party
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.3 unless the breach of covenant
or agreement, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the
terminating party not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under Section 9.2.2 (in the case of a breach of covenant by DCB) or
Section 9.3.2 (in the case of a breach of covenant by Bridge Bancorp);

  



  

11.1.4.  At the election of the Board of Directors of either Bridge Bancorp
or DCB, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Termination Date, or
such later date as shall have been agreed to in writing by Bridge Bancorp and
DCB; _provided_ , _that_  no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 11.1.4 if the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or
before said date was due to such party's material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement;

  



  

11.1.5.  By Bridge Bancorp, if (i) DCB or the Board of Directors of DCB shall
have made a Recommendation Change, or (ii) DCB or the Board of Directors of
DCB shall have breached its obligations under Section 8.2 or 7.5 in any

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) Regulatory Approval
includes a Burdensome Condition, or (iii) any court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree, ruling or
taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the

(A)  Except as provided below, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with

costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Joint Proxy Statement-
Prospectus and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with
the Merger shall be borne equally by Bridge Bancorp and DCB.

  



  

(B)  In the event of a termination of this Agreement because of a

and all damages, costs and expenses, including all reasonable attorneys'
fees, sustained or incurred by the non-breaching party as a result thereof or
in connection therewith or with respect to the enforcement of its rights
hereunder.

  



  

(C) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_  Acquisition
Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board
of Directors or senior management of Bridge Bancorp or shall have been made
directly to the shareholders of Bridge Bancorp, or any Person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to
the Bridge Bancorp Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal, in each case with
respect to Bridge Bancorp and (A) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated
by either DCB or Bridge Bancorp pursuant to Section 11.1.4 without the
Requisite Bridge Bancorp Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions
set forth in Section 9.1 and Section 9.3 were satisfied or were capable of
being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by DCB pursuant to Section 11.1.2 or 11.1.3 as a result of a
willful breach, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, Bridge Bancorp enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to
above), then Bridge Bancorp shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into
such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction,
pay DCB, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to $18.0 million
(the  "Termination Fee"); _provided_ , _that_ for purposes of this Section
11.2.2, all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-
five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)."

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by DCB pursuant to
Section 11.1.6, then Bridge Bancorp shall pay DCB, by wire transfer of same-
day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of

(D)  (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_  Acquisition
Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board
of Directors or senior management of DCB or shall have been made directly to
the shareholders of DCB or any Person shall have publicly announced (and not
withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the DCB Meeting) an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to DCB and (A) (x) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by either DCB or Bridge Bancorp pursuant to
Section 11.1.4 without the Requisite DCB Vote having been obtained (and all
other conditions set forth in Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 were satisfied or
were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by Bridge Bancorp pursuant to Section 11.1.2 or
11.1.3 as a result of a willful breach, and (B) prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, DCB enters into a
definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then DCB shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into
such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction,
pay Bridge Bancorp the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds;
_provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 11.2.2, all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to 'twenty-five percent (25%)" shall
instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)."

  



  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Bridge Bancorp
pursuant to Section 11.1.5, then DCB shall pay Bridge Bancorp, by wire
transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days
of the date of termination.

  



  

(E)  The right to receive payment of the Termination Fee under
Section 11.2.2(C) or (D) will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Bridge Bancorp against DCB and its Subsidiaries, and DCB against Bridge
Bancorp and its Subsidiaries, respectively, and their respective officers and
directors with respect to a termination under (i) or (ii) in Sections 11.2.2
(C) and (D) above. In no event shall either party be required to pay the
Termination Fee more than once.

  



  

11.2.3.  Each of DCB and Bridge Bancorp acknowledges that the agreements
contained in Section 11.2.2(C) and (D) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 11.2.2(C) and (D), and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against
the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such
non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if DCB or Bridge Bancorp, as the case may be, fails to pay the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 11.2.2(C) and (D), then such party shall
pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime
rate" published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date on which such
payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that
such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date
that such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

   | 11.3.| Amendment, Extension and Waiver.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether
before or after approval thereof by the shareholders of DCB), the
parties hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a)
amend this Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after any approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
by the shareholders of DCB, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount, value
or changes the form of consideration to be delivered to DCB's shareholders
pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any

supervisory information (including confidential supervisory information as
defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and as identified in 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8))
of a Governmental Entity by any party to this Agreement to the extent

substitute disclosures or actions shall be made or taken under circumstances
in which the limitations of the preceding sentence apply.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part of this
Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the
related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part of
"Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material
contained in the subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of
contents, index and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date
hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,
shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the Recitals to this
Agreement. The term "made available" means any document or other information
that was (a) included in the virtual data room of a party at least two (2)
business days prior to the date hereof, or (b) filed by a party with the SEC
and publicly available on EDGAR at least two (2) business days prior to the

drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties
hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law
to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

VOTING AGREEMENT

  



  

This Voting Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 1, 2020, is
entered into by and between Dime Community Bancshares, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, ("DCB") and the undersigned party (the "Shareholder").

  



  

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as the same may be amended, supplemented or modified, the
("Merger Agreement")), dated as of the date hereof, by and between DCB and
Bridge Bancorp, Inc. ("BB"), DCB will be merged with and into BB, with BB as
the surviving corporation (the "Merger");

  



  

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder owns beneficially
or of record, and has the power to vote or direct the voting of, certain
shares of common stock issued by BB, par value $0.01 per share (all such
shares, the "Existing Shares"); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement for BB and DCB to enter into the
Merger Agreement, DCB requires that the Shareholder, in his or her capacity
as a shareholder, enter into this Agreement, and the Shareholder has agreed to
enter into this Agreement.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  



   | 1.| _Definitions_. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement
have the meaning assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement. The
following definition also applies to this Agreement: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | a.| _Beneficial Ownership_. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"beneficial owner" and "beneficially own" shall have the meaning set forth in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| _Effectiveness; Termination_. This Agreement shall be effective
upon signing. This Agreement shall automatically terminate and be null and
void and of no effect upon the earlier of (i) the Effective Time, or (ii) if
the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its
terms, as of the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement; _provided_
that (i) this _Section 2_ and _Sections 8_ through _13_ hereof shall survive
any such termination and (ii) such termination shall not relieve any party of
any liability or damages resulting from any willful or material breach of any
of his or her representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set
forth herein. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | A-1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 3.| _Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (a)
the final adjournment of the BB shareholder meeting to vote upon the Merger
Agreement or any related matter ("BB Shareholder Meeting") or (b) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (such period of
time, the "Support Period"), the Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally
hereby agrees, that at the BB Shareholder Meeting (whether annual or special
and each adjourned or postponed meeting), however called, or in connection
with any written consent of BB's shareholders to vote upon the Merger
Agreement, the Shareholder shall (i) appear at the BB Shareholder Meeting or
otherwise cause all of his or her Existing Shares and all other shares of BB
Common Stock or voting securities of BB over which such Shareholder has
acquired beneficial or record ownership after the date hereof and has the
power to vote or direct the voting of (including any shares of BB
Common Stock acquired by means of purchase, dividend or distribution, or
issued upon the exercise of any stock options to acquire BB Common Stock or
the conversion of any convertible securities, or pursuant to any other equity
awards or derivative securities (including any BB Stock Options) or
otherwise) (together with the Existing Shares, the "Shares"), which such
Shareholder beneficially owns or controls as of the applicable record date
for the BB Shareholder Meeting, to be counted as present thereat for purposes
of calculating a quorum, and (ii) vote or cause to be voted (including by
proxy or written consent, if applicable) all such Shares (A) in favor of the
approval of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (B) in favor of any proposal to
adjourn or postpone the BB Shareholder Meeting to a later date if there
are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement, (C) against any
action or proposal in favor of an Acquisition Proposal, and (D) against any
action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be likely to
(1) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any
other obligation or agreement of BB contained in the Merger Agreement, or of
the Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or (2) prevent, impede,
interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or frustrate the purposes of
or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ , that the foregoing
applies solely to the Shareholder in his or her capacity as a shareholder and
the Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding in this Agreement in the
Shareholder's capacity as a director or officer of BB or any of its
subsidiaries (if the Shareholder holds such office), and nothing in this
Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the
Shareholder in the Shareholder's capacity as such a director or officer,
including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such
actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement; or (b) will
be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the Shareholder from exercising
the Shareholder's fiduciary duties as an officer or director to BB or
its shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments apply
to any Shares held by any Affiliate, as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement. The Shareholder covenants and agrees that, except for this

agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically
enforceable pursuant to its terms and that DCB would be irreparably harmed

remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which DCB may be entitled
(including monetary damages), DCB shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, and the Shareholder
hereby waives any defense in any action for specific performance or an
injunction or other equitable relief that a remedy at law would be adequate.
The Shareholder further agrees that neither DCB nor any other person or
entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this paragraph, and the Shareholder irrevocably waives any
right he or she may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of
any such bond or similar instrument.

or of record, and has the power to vote or direct the voting of, certain
shares of common stock issued by DCB, no par value per share (all such shares,
the "Existing Shares"); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement for BB and DCB to enter into the
Merger Agreement, BB requires that the Shareholder, in his or her capacity as
a shareholder, enter into this Agreement, and the Shareholder has agreed to
enter into this Agreement.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  



   | 1.| _Definitions_. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement
have the meaning assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement. The
following definition also applies to this Agreement: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | a.| _Beneficial Ownership_. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"beneficial owner" and "beneficially own" shall have the meaning set forth in

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| _Effectiveness; Termination_. This Agreement shall be effective
upon signing. This Agreement shall automatically terminate and be null and
void and of no effect upon the earlier of (i) the Effective Time, or (ii) if
the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its
terms, as of the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement; _provided_
that (i) this _Section 2_ and _Sections 8_ through _13_ hereof shall survive
any such termination and (ii) such termination shall not relieve any party of
any liability or damages resulting from any willful or material breach of any
of his or her representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set
forth herein. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | A-10|

   | 3.| _Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (a)
the final adjournment of the DCB shareholder meeting to vote upon the Merger
Agreement or any related matter ("DCB Shareholder Meeting") or (b) the

hereby agrees, that at the DCB Shareholder Meeting (whether annual or special
and each adjourned or postponed meeting), however called, or in connection
with any written consent of DCB's shareholders to vote upon the Merger
Agreement, the Shareholder shall (i) appear at the DCB Shareholder Meeting or
otherwise cause all of his or her Existing Shares and all other shares of DCB
Common Stock or voting securities of DCB over which such Shareholder has
acquired beneficial or record ownership after the date hereof and has the
power to vote or direct the voting of (including any shares of DCB Common
Stock acquired by means of purchase, dividend or distribution, or issued upon

transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (B) in favor of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone the DCB Shareholder Meeting to a later

Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the
Shareholder in the Shareholder's capacity as such a director or officer,

actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement; or (b) will
be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the Shareholder from exercising
the Shareholder's fiduciary duties as an officer or director to DCB or its
shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments apply to
any Shares held by any Affiliate, as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement. The Shareholder covenants and agrees that, except for this
Agreement, such Shareholder (x) has not entered into, and shall not enter
into during the Support Period, any voting agreement or voting trust with
respect to the Shares and (y) has not granted, and shall not grant during the

in the creation of a lien on any of the Shares pursuant to, any agreement or

of his or her obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees,
without further consideration, to execute and deliver such additional

interest of BB, but no such assignment shall relieve BB of its obligations
hereunder.

   | 8.| _Remedies/Specific Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically
enforceable pursuant to its terms and that BB would be irreparably harmed

remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which BB may be entitled
(including monetary damages), BB shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief

injunction or other equitable relief that a remedy at law would be adequate.
The Shareholder further agrees that neither BB nor any other person or entity
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
paragraph, and the Shareholder irrevocably waives any right he or she may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or

agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| _Effectiveness; Termination_. This Agreement shall be effective

thereof) of the BB shareholders to vote upon the Merger Agreement or any

waiver or modification of the Merger Agreement without the Shareholder's

each case, payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement in effect on the date of
this Agreement or (z) otherwise affecting the Shareholder in a materially
adverse manner or (iii) if the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason
in accordance with its terms, as of the date of the termination of the Merger
Agreement;  _provided_ that (i) this _Section 2_ and _Sections 8_ through
_13_ hereof shall survive any such termination and (ii) such termination
shall not relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any
willful or material breach of any of his or her representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth herein.

   | 3.| _Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (a)
the final adjournment of the BB shareholder meeting to vote upon the Merger
Agreement or any related matter ("BB Shareholder Meeting") or (b) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (such period of
time, the "Support Period"), the Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally
hereby agrees, that at the BB Shareholder Meeting (whether annual or special
and each adjourned or postponed meeting), however called, or in connection
with any written consent of BB's shareholders to vote upon the Merger
Agreement, the Shareholder shall (i) appear at the BB Shareholder Meeting or
otherwise cause all of his or her Existing Shares that such Shareholder has
the sole power to vote or direct the voting of and all other shares of BB
Common Stock or voting securities of BB over which such Shareholder has
acquired beneficial or record ownership after the date hereof and has the
sole power to vote or direct the voting of (including any shares of BB Common
Stock acquired by means of purchase, dividend or distribution, or issued upon
the exercise of any stock options to acquire BB Common Stock or the conversion
of any convertible securities, or pursuant to any other equity awards or
derivative securities (including any BB Stock Options) or otherwise) (together
with the Existing Shares, the "Shares"), which such Shareholder beneficially
owns or controls as of the applicable record date for the BB Shareholder
Meeting, to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a
quorum, and (ii) vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written
consent, if applicable) all such Shares (A) in favor of the approval of
the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, (B) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or
postpone the BB Shareholder Meeting to a later date if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement, (C) against any action or
proposal in favor of an Acquisition Proposal, and (D) against any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be likely to (1)
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of BB contained in the Merger Agreement, or of the
Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or (2) prevent, impede,
interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or frustrate the purposes of or
adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ , that in each case, the
Merger Agreement shall not have been amended or modified in any manner
without the Shareholder\'s prior written consent to (x) change the amount of
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement in effect
on the date of this Agreement, (y) change the form of the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement in effect on the date
of this Agreement or (z) otherwise affect the Shareholder in a
materially adverse manner; _provided, further_ , that the foregoing and the
other provisions herein apply solely to the Shareholder in his or her
capacity as a shareholder of BB and the Shareholder makes no agreement or
understanding in this Agreement in the Shareholder's capacity as a director
or officer of BB or any of its subsidiaries (if the Shareholder holds such
office), and nothing in this Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions
or omissions taken by the Shareholder in the Shareholder's capacity as such a
director or officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger
Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement; or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the
Shareholder from exercising the Shareholder's fiduciary duties as an officer
or director to BB or its shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing commitments apply to any Shares held by any Affiliate, as such term
is defined in the Merger Agreement. The Shareholder covenants and agrees
that, except for this Agreement, such Shareholder (x) has not entered into,
and shall not enter into during the Support Period, any voting agreement or
voting trust with respect to the Shares and (y) has not granted, and shall not
grant during the Support Period, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with
respect to the Shares except any proxy to carry out the intent of this
Agreement and any proxy granted for ordinary course proposals at an annual

commitment with any person the effect of which would be inconsistent with or
otherwise violate the provisions and agreements set forth herein.

Shareholder will not, during the Support Period, without the prior written
consent of DCB, directly or indirectly, offer for sale, sell, transfer,

other disposition of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of
law or otherwise) or otherwise convey or dispose of, any of the Shares, or
any interest therein, including the right to vote any Shares, as applicable
(to the extent the Shareholder has the sole right to dispose of or direct the
disposition of such Shares, a "Transfer"); _provided_ , that the
Shareholder may (i) Transfer Shares pursuant to any currently existing pledge
agreement or for estate planning or philanthropic purposes so long as the
transferee, prior to the date of Transfer, agrees in a signed writing to be
bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement and the Shareholder
provides at least two (2) days' prior written notice to DCB (which shall
include the written consent of the transferee agreeing to be bound by and

case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (iii) surrender Shares to BB in

writing by DCB in its sole discretion, or (v) Transfer shares to an Affiliate

foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Shareholder shall not be
precluded from holding its clients' shares in margin accounts at broker-
dealers in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and

   | 5.| _Representations of the Shareholder_. The Shareholder represents
and warrants to DCB as follows: (a) the Shareholder has full legal right,
capacity and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform the
Shareholder's obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (b) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Shareholder and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by DCB, constitutes a valid and
legally binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, and no other action is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder or
the performance of his or her obligations hereunder; (c) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance with the provisions
hereof will not, conflict with or violate any law or result in any breach of
or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a lien on any of the Shares pursuant to, any agreement or
other instrument or obligation binding upon the Shareholder or the Shares
(including under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of BB), nor
require any authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity except for, filings with the SEC of such reports under the
Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any filing
required under Section 13 or Section 16 under the Exchange Act; (d) the
Shareholder beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 of the
Exchange Act) and has the sole power to vote or direct the voting of the
Shares, and the number of such Shares as of the date of this Agreement is
identified on the signature page hereto; (e) the Shareholder beneficially
owns the Shares free and clear of any proxy, voting restriction, adverse
claim or other lien (other than any restrictions created or permitted by this
Agreement, under applicable federal or state securities laws, under the
Shareholder's organizational documents or customary liens pursuant to the
terms of any custody or similar agreement applicable to Shares held in
brokerage accounts); and (f) the Shareholder has read and is familiar with
the terms of the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the
Shareholder may be deemed to have beneficial ownership, but not the voting
authority, with respect to 599,928 Shares (the " _Shared Voting Shares_ "),
and the Shareholder will use its best efforts to recommend to such parties
with voting authority that it vote such Shared Voting Shares in the same
manner as the Shareholder is obligated to vote the other Shares pursuant to
this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees that the Shareholder shall not take
any action that would make any representation or warranty of the Shareholder
contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing,
impairing, delaying or adversely affecting the performance by the Shareholder
of his or her obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees,
without further consideration, to execute and deliver such additional
documents and to take such further actions as are necessary or reasonably
requested by DCB to confirm and assure the rights and obligations set forth
in this Agreement. The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that DCB is
entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by such Shareholder and the representations and warranties
of such Shareholder contained herein. Such Shareholder understands and
acknowledges that the Merger Agreement governs the terms of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated thereby.

 | A-22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 6.| _Publicity_. The Shareholder hereby authorizes BB and DCB to
publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure in connection with the
Merger, including in the Merger Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus or any other filing with any Governmental Entity made in
connection with the Merger, the Shareholder's identity and ownership of the
Shares and the nature of the Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement.
The Shareholder agrees to notify DCB as promptly as practicable of any
inaccuracies or omissions in any information relating to the Shareholder that
is so published or disclosed. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. The recitals are incorporated as
a part of this Agreement. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, other than, if the Shareholder is a director or officer of BB, with
respect to any employment, non-competition, non-solicit, change of control,
severance, or consulting agreement between the Shareholder and either BB or
DCB, or its Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person not a party to this Agreement
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the rights under this Agreement
are assignable by DCB to a majority-owned Affiliate or any successor-in-
interest of DCB, but no such assignment shall relieve DCB of its obligations
hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.| _Remedies/Specific Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically
enforceable pursuant to its terms and that DCB would be irreparably harmed
if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with its specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate
remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which DCB may be entitled
(including monetary damages), DCB shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, and the Shareholder
hereby waives any defense in any action for specific performance or an
injunction or other equitable relief that a remedy at law would be adequate.
The Shareholder further agrees that neither DCB nor any other person or
entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this paragraph, and the Shareholder irrevocably waives any
right he or she may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of
any such bond or similar instrument. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.| _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to any applicable conflict of law principles. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.| _Notice_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, electronic
mail (with confirmation), mailed by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) or delivered by an express courier (with confirmation) if
to the Shareholder, to the address or e-mail address, as applicable, set
forth in _Schedule A_ hereto, and if to DCB, in accordance with Section 12.3
of the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | A-23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 11.| _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | a.| _Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed (a) in the case of an amendment, by DCB and the Shareholder, and (b)
in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.| _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) THE
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (III)
THE PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) THE PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

90,000,000 shares, of which 80,000,000 shares shall be shares of common

of amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to the applicable

number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the
designation, power, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series
and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The number of
authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not
below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of common stock, without a vote of the
holders of the preferred stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of
any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any preferred stock
designation.

  



  

4.2. _Preemptive Rights_. No holder of shares of any class or of any
series of any class of the Corporation shall have any preemptive right
to subscribe for, purchase or receive any shares of the Corporation, whether
now or hereafter authorized, or any obligations or other securities
convertible into or carrying options to purchase any such shares of the
Corporation, or any options or rights to purchase any such shares or
securities, issued or sold by the Corporation for cash or any other form of
consideration, and any such shares, securities or rights may be issued or

 | C-2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.3.1.   _Designation and Amount._ The series of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share, shall be designated as the "5.50% Fixed-Rate Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A" (the "Series A Preferred
Stock"). The Series A Preferred Stock shall be perpetual, subject to the
provisions of Section 4.3.6 hereof, and the authorized number of shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 5,299,200 shares. The number of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock may be increased from time to time pursuant to
the provisions of Section 4.3.7 hereof and any such additional shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall form a single series with the Series A
Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the same
designations, powers, preferences and rights as every other share of Series A
Preferred Stock.

  



  

4.3.2. _Dividends_.

  



  

(a) Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of assets legally
available for the payment of dividends under New York law, non-cumulative cash
dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock
at a rate equal to 5.50% per annum for each Dividend Period (as
defined below) from ___________, _____ (the "Initial Dividend Accrual Date"),
beginning on ____________, _____. If the Corporation issues additional shares
of Series A Preferred Stock after the Initial Dividend Accrual Date, dividends
on such additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock may accumulate from and
including the Initial Dividend Accrual Date, the then most recent
Dividend Payment Date or any other date the Corporation specifies at the time
such additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock are issued. A "Dividend
Period" means the period from, and including, a Dividend Payment Date (as
defined below) to, but excluding, the next Dividend Payment Date, except that
the initial Dividend Period shall commence on and include the Initial Dividend
Accrual Date.

  



  

(b) If declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized
committee of the Board of Directors, the Corporation shall pay dividends on
the Series A Preferred Stock quarterly in arrears, on February 15, May 15,
August 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on ____________, _____
(each such day on which dividends are payable, a "Dividend Payment Date"). In
the event that any Dividend Payment Date falls on a day that is not a
Business Day (as defined below), then the dividend payment due on that
date shall be due on the next day that is a Business Day and no additional
dividends shall accrue as a result of that postponement. A "Business Day"
means any day, other than a Saturday or a Sunday, that is not a day on which
banking institutions in the State of New York, are generally authorized or
required by law or governmental action to close.

  



  

(c) Dividends shall be payable to holders of record of shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the
Corporation on the applicable record date, not exceeding 30 days before the
applicable Dividend Payment Date, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors
or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors.

  



  

(d) Dividends payable on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation shall be
rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. If the
Corporation redeems the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4.3.6,
dividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue on
the redemption date, if any, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of
the redemption price of the Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption.
No interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of
Series A Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.

  



  

   

 | C-3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Dividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not
be cumulative. If for any reason the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee of the Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on
the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of a Dividend Period, then no
dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such Dividend Period or be
payable on the applicable Dividend Payment Date, and the Corporation shall
have no obligation to pay any dividend for that Dividend Period, whether or
not the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors declares a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock for any
subsequent Dividend Period with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock or
for any future dividend period with respect to any other series of preferred
stock of the Corporation or common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Corporation (the "Common Stock").

  



  

(f) So long as any share of the Series A Preferred Stock remains
outstanding, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock in respect of the most recently completed Dividend Period have
been declared and paid in full or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
set aside for such payment:

  



   | (i)| no dividend shall be declared or paid or a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared
or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Securities (as defined below)
(other than (1) a dividend payable solely in Junior Securities or (2) any
dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholders' rights plan,
or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| no shares of Junior Securities shall be repurchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or
indirectly (other than (1) as a result of a reclassification of Junior
Securities for or into other Junior Securities, (2) the exchange or
conversion of one share of Junior Securities for or into another share of
Junior Securities, (3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially
contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Securities, (4) purchases,
redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Junior Securities in
connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar
arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or
consultants, (5) purchases of shares of Junior Securities pursuant to a
contractually binding requirement to buy Junior Securities existing prior to
such most recently completed Dividend Period, including under a contractually
binding stock repurchase plan, or (6) the purchase of fractional interests in
shares of Junior Securities pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions
of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged), nor shall any
monies be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any
such security by the Corporation; and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | C-4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (iii)| no shares of Parity Securities (as defined below) shall be
repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the
Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than (1) pursuant to pro rata
offers to purchase all, or a pro rata portion, of the Series A Preferred
Stock and such Parity Securities, if any, (2) as a result of a
reclassification of Parity Securities for or into other Parity Securities,
(3) the exchange or conversion of Parity Securities for or into other Parity
Securities or Junior Securities, (4) through the use of the proceeds of a
substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Parity Securities,
(5) purchases, redemption or other acquisitions of shares of Parity
Securities in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other
similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors
or consultants, or pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy
Parity Securities existing prior to such most recently completed Dividend
Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, or (6)
the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Parity Securities
pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Parity Securities
or the security being converted or exchanged) nor shall any monies be paid to
or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities
by the Corporation. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(g) No dividends shall be declared or paid or funds set apart for
the payment of dividends on any Parity Securities, if any, for any
period unless dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been
contemporaneously declared and paid in full or a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof set aside for such payment for all declared and unpaid
dividends (without accumulation of any undeclared dividends) for all Dividend
Periods. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and any other Parity Securities, if any, all dividends
declared and paid upon the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and any
other Parity Securities, if any, shall be declared on a proportional basis so
that the amount of dividends declared per share shall bear to each other the
same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per
share on Series A Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any
accumulations, if any, on such Parity Securities, if any, bear to each other.
No Interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series
A Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.

  



  

(h) Subject to the conditions in this Section 4.3.2, and not
otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may
be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the
Board of Directors, may be declared and paid on Junior Securities or Parity
Securities, if any, from time to time out of any assets legally available for
such payment, and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to participate in those dividends.

  



  

(i)  Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be
declared, paid or funds set apart for the payment thereof to the extent such
act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply with any applicable laws and
regulations, including applicable capital adequacy rules of any appropriate
federal banking regulator or agency.

  



  

   

 | C-5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.3.3. _Liquidation Preference_.

  



  

(a) Upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Corporation, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation
legally available for distribution to its stockholders a liquidating
distribution of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to the sum of any
declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any
undeclared dividends, for Dividend Periods prior to the Dividend Period in
which the liquidation distribution is made and any declared and unpaid
dividends for the then current Dividend Period in which the liquidation
distribution is made to the date of such liquidation distribution, before any
payment or distribution of assets to the holders of the Common Stock or any
other class or series of Junior Securities. Holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation and
shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the
Corporation after such holders have received their full liquidating
distribution as provided for in this Section 4.3.3.

  



  

(b) In any such distribution, if the assets of the Corporation are
not sufficient to pay the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid
dividends in full to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the
liquidation amounts owed to all holders of Parity Securities, if any, the
amounts paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of
Parity Securities, if any, shall be paid pro rata in accordance with the
respective aggregate liquidating distributions owed to those holders. If the
liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in
full to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the
liquidation amounts owed to all holders of Parity Securities, if any, have
been paid in full to all such holders, the holders of Junior Securities shall
be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to
their respective rights and preferences.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Section 4.3.3, the merger or
consolidation by the Corporation with or into any other entity or by another
entity with or into the Corporation, including a merger or consolidation in
which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or
property for their shares, or the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of
all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Corporation for
cash, securities or other consideration, shall not constitute a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. If the Corporation enters into
any merger or consolidation transaction with or into any other entity and the
Corporation is not the surviving entity in such transaction, the Series A
Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of the surviving or successor
corporation or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving or successor
corporation having terms that are substantially similar to the terms of the
Series A Preferred Stock set forth herein.

  



  

4.3.4. _Preemption and Conversion_. The holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall not have any preemptive rights with respect to any
shares of the Corporation's capital stock or any of its other securities
convertible into or carrying rights or options to purchase any such capital
stock. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any rights
to convert such shares into shares of any other class or series of securities
of, or any interest or property in, the Corporation.

  



  

   

 | C-6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.3.5. _Voting Rights_.

  



  

(a) The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have no
voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time, either as a
separate series or class or together with any other series or class of shares
of capital stock, and shall not be entitled to call a meeting of such
holders for any purpose nor shall they be entitled to participate in any
meeting of the holders of the Common Stock, except as provided in this
Section 4.3.5 or as otherwise specifically required by law.

  



  

(b) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-
thirds in voting power of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock and any Voting Parity Stock, voting together as a single class of the
Corporation's capital stock, shall be required to authorize or increase the
authorized amount of, or issue or create shares of, any class or series of
Senior Securities, or reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such
shares of Senior Securities, or issue any obligation or security convertible
into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of Senior
Securities.

  



  

(c) So long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-
thirds in voting power of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock, voting together as a separate class of the Corporation's capital
stock, shall be required to:

  



   | (i)| amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, including by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or
rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however,
that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred
Stock or authorized Common Stock or authorized preferred stock or the
creation and issuance, or an increase or decrease in the authorized or
issued amount, of other series of capital stock ranking equally with or
junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of
dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) or the
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, shall not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences,
privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification
involving the Series A Preferred Stock, or a merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with or into another entity unless (i) the shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for
preference securities of the new surviving entity and (ii) the shares of the
remaining Series A Preferred Stock or new preferred securities have terms
that are substantially similar to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | C-7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If the Corporation fails to pay, or declare and set apart for
payment, dividends on outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for
six or more quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, the number
of directors on the Board of Directors shall be increased by two until
continuous noncumulative dividends for at least one year on all outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled thereto shall have been paid, or
declared and set apart for payment, in full, the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting as a class together with holders
of any other equally ranked series of preferred stock as to payment of
dividends and that have similar voting rights, if any (such stock, "Voting
Parity Stock"), to vote for the election of such two additional members of
the Board of Directors (such additional directors, the "Preferred
Directors"), at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of
record of at least 20% of the aggregate voting power of the Series A
Preferred Stock or any other series of Parity Securities (unless such request
is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the Corporation's
next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, or if no such request is
made, in either event such election shall be held at such next annual or
special meeting of the stockholders), to hold office for a term of one
year; provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than
two Preferred Directors. Upon such payment, or such declaration and setting
apart for payment, in full, the terms of the Preferred Directors shall
forthwith terminate, and the number of directors shall be reduced by two, and
such voting right of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall cease,
subject to increase in the number of directors as described in this clause
(d) and to revesting of such voting right in the event of each and
every additional failure in the payment of dividends for six quarterly
Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, as described in this clause
(d).

  



  

(e) Any Preferred Director may be removed and replaced at any time,
with cause as provided by law or without cause by the affirmative vote of the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock voting together as a class with the
holders of Voting Parity Stock, to the extent the voting rights of such
holders described in clause (d) above are then exercisable. Any vacancy
created by removal with or without cause may be filled only as described in
the preceding sentence. If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant
for any reason other than removal, the remaining Preferred Director may
choose a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of
which such vacancy occurred. In addition, if and when the rights of holders of
Series A Preferred Stock terminate for any reason, including under
circumstances described in Section 4.3.6, such voting rights shall terminate
along with the other rights (except, if applicable, the right to receive the
redemption price plus any declared and unpaid dividends as provided for in
Section 4.3.6), and the terms of any Preferred Directors shall terminate
automatically and the number of directors reduced by two, assuming that the
rights of holders of Voting Parity Stock have similarly terminated.

  



  

(f) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this Section
4.3.5 or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by the
Corporation, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
one vote.

  



  

(g) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or
prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would
otherwise be required or upon which the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to vote shall be effected, all outstanding shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or shall have been
called for redemption by the giving of notice thereof pursuant to Section
4.3.6(c) below and sufficient funds shall have been irrevocably deposited in
trust to effect such redemption.

  



  

   

 | C-8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) Notice for a special meeting to elect the Preferred Directors shall
be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Corporation's bylaws for
a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Corporation
does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such
request, then any requesting holder of Series A Preferred Stock may (at the
Corporation's expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this
Section 4.3.5(h), and for that purpose shall have access to the
stock register of the Corporation.

  



  

4.3.6. _Redemption_.

  



  

(a) The Series A Preferred Stock shall not be subject to any
mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have the right to require the
redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock.

  



  

(b) The Corporation, at the option of the Board of Directors or any
duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may redeem out of assets
lawfully available therefor the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in
part, from time to time, on or after June 15, 2025, subject to the approvals
required by Section 4.3.6(g), at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share,
plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods and any
accrued but unpaid (whether or not declared) dividends for the then-current
Dividend Period to, but excluding, the redemption date.

  



  

(c) At any time within 90 days after a Regulatory Capital Treatment
Event (as defined below), the Corporation, at the option of the Board of
Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may
provide notice of its intent to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in
accordance with the procedures described below, and the Corporation may
subsequently redeem, out of assets lawfully available therefor, the Series A
Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, subject to the approvals required
by Section 4.3.6(g), at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus
any declared and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods and any accrued
but unpaid (whether or not declared) dividends for the then-current Dividend
Period to but excluding the redemption date.

  



  

"Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by
the Corporation that, as a result of any:

  



   | (i)| amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective
change) in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political
subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective
after the initial issuance of any share of the Series A Preferred Stock; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced
or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Series A
Preferred Stock; or 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | C-9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (iii)| final official administrative decision or judicial decision or
administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or
applying those laws or regulations that is made, adopted, approved or becomes
effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Series A Preferred
Stock, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation shall not be
entitled to treat an amount equal to the aggregate liquidation preference of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding as "additional Tier 1
Capital" (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy rules or
regulations of Federal Reserve Regulation Y (or, as and if applicable, the
capital adequacy rules or regulations of any successor appropriate federal
banking regulator or agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long
as any share of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding.

  



  

(d) If shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed,
the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of
record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than
30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof
(provided that, if the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are held in book-
entry form through The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), the Corporation may
give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Any notice so mailed as
provided in this Section 4.3.6(d) shall be conclusively presumed to have been
duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice and any defect in
such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of
the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock. Each notice of redemption shall state (i) the redemption
date; (ii) the number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed
and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the
number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such
holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the
certificates, if any, evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the
shares to be redeemed shall cease to accrue on the redemption date.

  



  

(e) If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before
the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the
redemption have been irrevocably set aside by the Corporation, separate and
apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders
of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available
therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company
selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the
Board of Directors, which bank or trust company may be an affiliate of the
Corporation (the "Depositary Company"), in trust for the pro rata benefit of
the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, on and after the
redemption date, dividends shall cease to accrue on shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock, and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer
be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares shall
terminate, including rights described under Section 4.3.5, except the right to
