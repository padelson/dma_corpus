Closing, and the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to make payment
of such expense to such employees through the payroll of the applicable
Acquired Company at or as soon as practicable after the Closing, but in no
event later than two weeks after the Closing.

reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, from each financial institution or
other lender (or the agents representing the foregoing) of the Indebtedness
set forth on Schedule 1.3(f) of the Disclosure Schedules, confirming the total
payment required to be made as of the Closing Date to repay in full such
Indebtedness (such amounts, the "Payoff Amount"), together with pay-off

payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding Tax
under Section 1445 or 1446(f), as applicable, of the Code.

(h) Resignations. The Acquired Companies shall deliver to the Purchaser
resignations (effective as of the Closing) from the directors and managers of
each Acquired Company who are affiliated with the Existing Sponsor.

Section 1.4 Withholding. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
the Purchaser reasonably determines are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. Prior to the
deduction or withholding from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 1.4, the Purchaser shall notify
the Seller's Representative (which shall in turn notify the Person in respect
of which such deduction or withholding would apply) and the Parties will
reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid
to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

ARTICLE II 

PURCHASE PRICE; POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT

Section 2.1 Purchase Price.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a written statement (the
"Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth:

(i) the Acquired Companies\' good faith estimates of (A) the Cash Amount (the
"Estimated Cash Amount"), (B) the Indebtedness Amount (the "Estimated
Indebtedness Amount"), (C) the Net Working Capital Amount (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount") and (D) the Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated
Transaction Expenses");

(ii) a list of and, as applicable, payment instructions for the payment of,
the Estimated Transaction Expenses; and

(iii) the calculation of the Estimated Closing Purchase Price (based on the
estimates referenced in Section 2.1(a)(i)). 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Estimated Closing Purchase
Price" means (i) $1,800,000,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"), minus (ii) the
Estimated Indebtedness Amount, plus (iii) the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target Net Working Capital
Amount, minus (iv) the amount, if any, by which the Target Net Working Capital
Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, plus (v) the
Estimated Cash Amount, minus (vii) the Estimated Transaction Expenses, minus
(viii) the Escrow Amount.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Final Closing Purchase Price"
means (i) the Base Purchase Price, minus (ii) the Indebtedness Amount as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2, plus (iii) the amount, if any, by
which the Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.2 exceeds the Target Net Working Capital Amount, minus (iv) the amount, if
any, by which the Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Net Working
Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2, plus (v) the
Cash Amount as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2, minus (vii) the
Transaction Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2, minus
(viii) the Escrow Amount.

Section 2.2 Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation.

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Representative a consolidated
balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Calculation Time (the
"Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement, together with reasonable supporting
detail (including all calculations, documentation and working papers), showing
the calculation of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Net Working Capital
Amount derived from the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Transaction Expenses, including the calculation of the Final Closing Purchase
Price as a result thereof and a reconciliation to the Estimated Closing
Statement (together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the "Final Closing
Statement"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x)
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statement (i) shall be
prepared and the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and
Net Working Capital Amount (including any estimates of the foregoing pursuant
to Section 2.1(a)) shall be determined on a consolidated basis in accordance
with the definitions set forth herein and with accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices and procedures, classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology consistent with GAAP as applied by the Acquired
Companies in the December 31, 2019 Audited Financial Statements, (ii) shall be
based on facts and circumstances as they are known to exist as of the
applicable Calculation Time and shall not otherwise include any changes in
assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other
changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the Transactions or
arising from any act, decision or event occurring on or after the Closing, and
(iii) shall not include any additional provision or accrual or increase in any
existing provision or accrual included in the Estimated Closing Statement,
except to the extent new facts or events have arisen after the date of the
December 31, 2019 Audited Financial Statements and before the Calculation Time
that, applying the same management, judgment, methodologies, practices,
classification, policies and procedures, would justify such a provision,
accrual or increase and (y) in no event shall the Indebtedness Amount, the Net
Working Capital Amount or Transaction Expenses be calculated to include any
fees, liabilities and/or expenses to the extent incurred by or at that
direction of the 

Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof or otherwise relating to (i) the
Purchaser\'s or its Affiliates\' breach of this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby, (ii) the Purchaser\'s or its Affiliates\'
financing (including obtaining any consent or waiver relating thereto) for the
Transactions, (iii) any other liabilities or obligations incurred or arranged
by or on behalf of the Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions (including any fees payable to any financing institution or the
Acquired Companies\' Representatives on behalf of the Purchaser or its
Affiliates), or (iv) any post-Closing agreements, plans or arrangements
between or among the Purchaser or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Acquired Companies or their Representatives, on the other hand.

(b) The purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining the
Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital
Amount and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this Section
2.2 is to (i) measure the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, and Transaction
Expenses and (ii) measure differences in the Net Working Capital Amount
against the Target Net Working Capital Amount, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet or determining the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction
Expenses or Net Working Capital Amount that are different from those
contemplated by Section 2.2(a).

(c) The Seller Representative and its Representatives shall be permitted
reasonable access during normal business hours to review and obtain copies of
the Acquired Companies\' books and records and any work papers related to the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement and the adjustments contemplated
thereby. The Seller Representative and its Representatives may make reasonable
inquiries of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and their respective
accountants regarding questions or disagreements, and the Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
any such accountants to, cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. At the
request of the Seller Representative, the Acquired Companies shall use
reasonable best efforts to make available their personnel to advise and assist
the Seller Representative and its Representatives in their review of the Final
Closing Statement and any objections or disputes with respect thereto.

(d) If the Seller Representative has any objections to the Final Closing
Statement, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "Objections Statement"). If
an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within 45 days after
delivery of the Final Closing Statement to the Seller Representative, the
Final Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the
Parties. Upon the 45th day after receipt of the Final Closing Statement, then,
at the election of the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall promptly (but in any event
within two (2) Business Days) deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to account(s) previously designated in writing by the Seller
Representative to the Escrow Agent, any portion of the Escrow Amount not
reasonably necessary to cover the amounts in dispute. The Seller
Representative and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
objections in the Objections Statement, but if and to the extent they do not
reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Seller 

Representative and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to the Valuation
Firm, who shall act as an expert and not an arbiter, for resolution. Any
further submissions to the Valuation Firm must be written and delivered to
each party to the dispute. The Valuation Firm shall make a final determination
of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses, Net Working
Capital Amount, and the resulting Final Closing Purchase Price calculated with
reference to such amounts (solely to the extent such amounts are in dispute as
set forth in the Objections Statement) in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement and on Exhibit C. The Parties shall
cooperate with the Valuation Firm prior to and during the term of its
engagement, including by executing a customary engagement letter. The
determination of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses,
Net Working Capital Amount, and the resulting Final Closing Purchase Price
calculated with reference thereto, in each case in the manner contemplated by
this Section 2.2, shall become final and binding on the Parties on the date
the Valuation Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser. The cost of such review and determination
shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller
Representative, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion
of the disputed amount not awarded to a Party bears to the amount actually
disputed by such Party, with the portion of any payment due from the Sellers
paid by the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers in accordance with
Section 11.20(d). For example, if the Purchaser claims that Net Working
Capital Amount is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Seller
Representative, and the Seller Representative disputes only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Purchaser, and if the Valuation Firm awards the Purchaser $300
of the $500 disputed, then the cost of the Valuation Firm\'s review and report
shall be allocated 60% (i.e., $300/$500) to the Seller Representative and 40%
(i.e., $200/$500) to the Purchaser.

Section 2.3 Post-Closing Adjustment Payment.

(a) If the Final Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price, promptly after the date the Final Closing Purchase Price is
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2 (but in any event within 3 Business
Days), (i) the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers, in
accordance with Section 1.3(c), the aggregate amount of such excess, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
in writing by the Seller Representative to the Purchaser and (ii) the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to the Sellers the remaining funds in the Escrow Account, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in accordance with the wire transfer
instructions designated in writing by the Seller Representative to the Escrow
Agent. If the Final Closing Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price (such shortfall amount, if any, the "Shortfall Amount"),
promptly after the date the Final Closing Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.2 (but in any event within 3 Business Days), (x) the
Seller Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the funds
in the Escrow Account and (2) the Shortfall Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by
the Purchaser to the Escrow Agent and (y) to the extent that any balance in
the Escrow Account will remain after such payment to the Purchaser, the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser shall (simultaneously with the instruction in
clause (x)) jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Sellers the amount
remaining in the Escrow Account, to the account or accounts designated in
writing by the Seller Representative to the Escrow Agent. Neither the Sellers
nor any other Person 

shall have any liability for any amounts due to the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.2 or Section 2.3 in excess of the Escrow Amount, and the
Purchaser\'s sole source of recourse and recovery for any such amounts due
shall be the funds available in the Escrow Account.

(b) The funds available in the Escrow Account may be distributed to the
Purchaser and/or the Sellers solely and exclusively in accordance with Section
2.3(a) and the terms of the Escrow Agreement and shall not be available for
any other payment to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. All title and all
rights to all remaining funds in the Escrow Account shall automatically
transfer to the Sellers (i) immediately after the payments made to the
Purchaser under Section 2.3(a), if the Final Closing Purchase Price is less
than the Estimated Closing Purchase Price, or (ii) immediately upon the final
determination of the Final Closing Purchase Price, if the Final Closing
Purchase Price is greater than or equal to the Estimated Closing Purchase
Price, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Any amount paid under this Section 2.3 shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Estimated Closing Purchase Price for Tax purposes and, except to the
extent required by applicable Laws, the Parties agree not to take any position
inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax Return.

conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Acquired Companies; provided, further,
that the Acquired Companies shall not be obligated to provide such access or
information if the Acquired Companies determine, in their reasonable judgment,

Acquired Companies will advise the Purchaser what it is withholding and the
basis for such withholding; provided, further, that such access shall not

to provide such access or information if the Purchaser or the Acquired
Companies determine, in their reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third-party, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege or
expose such Party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information; provided, however, that the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies
(as applicable) will advise the Sellers and their authorized Representatives
what they are withholding and the basis for such withholding. Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by the Sellers, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit the Acquired Companies, for a period of seven (7) years following the
Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and

applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Acquired Companies or
the Sellers, as applicable, to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of

and reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies will purchase, and after the

liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof (the "Existing DandO

and expenses related to the DandO Tail Policy shall be paid 50% by the Purchaser
and 50% by the Sellers (as a Transaction Expense).

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and each Seller, his or her
heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies under this Section 7.7
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 7.7 applies unless (A) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected
Indemnitee, the Sellers or Representative shall have consented in writing
(email being sufficient) to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees, the Sellers or Representatives to whom

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any

all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 7.7.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to members\', managers\', directors\' and
officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Acquired Companies or any of their respective managers,
directors or officers.

(g) Effective upon the Closing, each Acquired Company, for itself and on
behalf of each of their respective successors and assigns, hereby releases and
forever discharges each Seller and each Seller\'s direct or indirect
equityholders, controlling Persons, controlling Affiliates and Representatives
(and any Representatives of any of the foregoing), in each case solely in
their capacities as such, of and from any and all Actions, causes of action
and liabilities relating to or arising out of (i) any actual or alleged breach
of any fiduciary duty or (ii) any rights or claims accruing to any of them
relating to or arising out of such Seller\'s ownership of the Acquired
Companies or the Purchased Equity that shall have arisen on or prior to the

operate as a release or compromise of any obligations of the Sellers under
this Agreement or under any agreement entered into pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) Effective upon the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its
successors and assigns, hereby releases and forever discharges the Acquired
Companies and their respective Representatives, in each case solely in their

against the Acquired Companies 

relating to or arising out of its ownership of the Acquired Companies or the

indemnification or exculpation obligations set forth in the Acquired
Companies\' existing organizational documents or otherwise, (x) rights or
claims under the Existing DandO Policy or any tail policy in respect thereof,
(y) obligations of the Acquired Companies or the Purchaser or its Affiliates

the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to any rights of the
Seller, complete control and supervision over their operations.

Section 7.9 Employee Matters.

(a) The Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to, and the Acquired
Companies shall, for a period of one year following the Closing, provide to
each individual who is an employee of any of the Acquired Companies as of
immediately prior to the Closing (each, an "Acquired Company Employee"), for
so long as such Acquired Continuing Employee remains employed with Purchaser,
(i) at least the same annual base salary or base wages, and target annual cash
bonus opportunity that were provided to such Acquired Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity
or equity-based incentives, severance, change in control benefits and one-time
retention or transaction bonuses) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser.
For eligibility and vesting purposes (other than vesting of future equity
awards) and for purposes of determining severance amounts and future vacation
accruals under the compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements,
policies or arrangements of the Purchaser, Purchaser shall cause each Acquired
Company Employee to receive credit for his or her service with the Acquired
Companies before the Closing to the same extent that such Acquired Company
Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for his or her service
under any similar or comparable Acquired Company Plans (except to the extent
this credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits in respect of
the same period of service). In addition, if Acquired Company Employees or
their dependents are included in any medical, dental, health or other welfare
benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (each, a "Successor Plan") other than the plan or plans in which
they participated immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "Prior Plan"), the
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Acquired
Company Employee to be eligible to participate immediately, without any
waiting time, in any and all Successor Plans, and cause the Successor Plans to
not include any restrictions, limitations or exclusionary provisions with
respect to pre-existing conditions, exclusions, or any actively-at-work
requirements relating to such Acquired Company Employee and his or her
dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements were
applicable under any similar Prior Plan at the time of commencement of
participation in such Successor Plan). 

(b) After the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall (i) recognize and provide
all earned but unused paid time off ("Accrued PTO") of the Acquired Company
Employees as of the Closing Date and (ii) allow each of the Acquired Company

under the Acquired Companies\' paid time off policies as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing, in each of clauses (i) and (ii), until the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs; provided, that any paid time off
that is earned but unused as of the last day of the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs shall be carried over under the Purchaser paid time off
policies to the extent required by applicable Law. The Acquired Companies will
be solely responsible for complying with the requirements of Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code for any
individual who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 54.4980B-9 in connection with the Transactions.

(c) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Company shall cause Optimal Blue, LLC to terminate the Optimal Blue,
LLC 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan") unless Purchaser provides
written notice to the Company that the 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated.
Unless Purchaser provides such written notice to the Company, the Company
shall provide Purchaser with executed board resolutions approving the
termination of the 401(k) Plan (effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date). The Purchaser shall take all actions
as are reasonably necessary to permit Acquired Company Employees who are
participants in the 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing to be
immediately eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by the
Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof, which 401(k) plan shall permit the rollover
of participant loan promissory notes from the 401(k) Plan.

(d) Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) except as required to comply with the other
provisions of this Section 7.9, shall alter or limit the Acquired Companies\'
or any of their respective Affiliates\' ability to amend, modify or terminate
any particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement; or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment
or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment. Nothing in this
Section 7.9 is intended to confer upon any individual (including employees,
retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) other than
the Parties any right as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

Section 7.10 Purchaser Insurance Policy. In the event that the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates binds any insurance policy related to the
representations and warranties of this Agreement (a "Purchaser Insurance
Policy"), such Purchaser Insurance Policy shall expressly provide that the
insurer or insurers issuing such policy shall have no right, and waive any
right, of subrogation, contribution or otherwise against the Sellers
(including any former, current or future Representative of the Sellers) based
upon, arising out of, or in any way connected to this Agreement, the
Transactions, or such Purchaser Insurance Policy, except with respect to Fraud
of any of the Sellers. The Sellers shall be intended third party beneficiaries
under any Purchaser Insurance Policy of the immediately preceding provision.
The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not amend, waive, modify or otherwise
revise the foregoing subrogation provision in any Purchaser Insurance Policy. 

Section 7.11 Section 280G. To the extent that any "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the applicable rulings
and final regulations thereunder) has the right to receive or retain any
payments and/or benefits that are reasonably likely to, separately or in the
aggregate, without regard to the measures described herein, constitute
"parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and
the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder on account of the
transactions completed under this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies will use reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain from each
such "disqualified individual" a waiver of such disqualified individual\'s
rights to some or all of such payments and/or benefits (the "Waived 280G
Benefits") so that any remaining payments and/or benefits shall not be deemed
to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder); provided,
that such waiver shall not include any payments or benefits that may be made
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates unless at least seven (7) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Purchaser provides a detailed description of any
agreement, contract or arrangement that Purchaser or its Affiliates are
providing or entering into on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to any
disqualified individual in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby satisfying the adequate disclosure requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code, of any such agreement, contract or arrangement
and amount of related "parachute payment", and (ii) submit a vote satisfying
the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the applicable rulings
and final regulations thereunder, along with adequate disclosure intended to
satisfy such requirements (including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such
regulations), the right of any such "disqualified individual" to receive the
Waived 280G Benefits. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to soliciting
the waivers described above from the disqualified individuals, the Acquired
Companies shall provide drafts of such waivers, disclosure materials and
supporting analysis to Purchaser for its review and comment and the Acquired
Companies shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by
Purchaser. Prior to Closing, the Acquired Companies will provide to the
Purchaser evidence that either (i) the requisite number of stockholder votes
was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the "280G Approval"),
or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the
Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided. The parties acknowledge
that the Acquired Companies cannot compel any disqualified individual to waive
any existing rights under a contract or agreement with the Acquired Companies
and in no event shall the Company or the Seller be deemed in breach of this
Section 7.11 if any such disqualified person refuses to waive any such right.



Section 7.12 Affiliate Contracts. At the Closing, the Acquired Companies will
cause the termination of the contracts or arrangements set forth on Schedule
7.12 of the Disclosure Schedules without any further cost or liability to the
Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries (or, after the Closing, the

in clause (ii) of Section 3.7(a) shall have been true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing.

(b) Performance of Covenants and Agreements of the Acquired Companies and the
Sellers. The Acquired Companies and the Sellers shall have performed in all
material respects all covenants and agreements (other than with respect to the
covenants and agreements contained in Section 7.13, the performance of which
shall not be a condition to Closing) required to be performed by them under
this Agreement at or prior to the Closing.

(c) No Acquired Company Material Adverse Effect. No Acquired Company Material
Adverse Effect shall have occurred since the date of this Agreement.

(d) Officer\'s Certificate. The Seller Representative shall have delivered to
the Purchaser a certificate for and on behalf of the Acquired Companies, dated
as of the Closing Date, stating that the preconditions specified in Section
8.2(a), Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c) have been satisfied.

If the Closing occurs, all closing conditions set forth in this Section 8.2
that have not been fully satisfied as of the Closing shall be deemed to have
been waived by the Purchaser. 

Section 8.3 Conditions to Obligations of the Sellers and the Acquired
Companies. The respective obligations of each of the Sellers and the Acquired
Companies to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
occur at the Closing is further subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if
permissible under applicable Law) at or prior to the Closing of the following
conditions:

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, disregarding all qualifications and
exceptions contained therein relating to materiality or Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing with the same effect as though made on and as of the Closing
(except to the extent that such representation and warranty expressly speaks
as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be
true and correct as of such earlier date), except where the failure to be true
and correct would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Performance of Covenants and Agreements of the Purchaser. The Purchaser
shall have performed in all material respects all covenants and agreements
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the
Closing.

(c) Officer\'s Certificate. The Purchaser shall have delivered to the Seller

stating that the preconditions specified in Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(b)

If the Closing occurs, all closing conditions set forth in this Section 8.3
that have not been fully satisfied as of the Closing shall be deemed to have
been waived by the Acquired Companies and the Sellers.

Section 8.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Sellers, the
Acquired Companies or the Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 8.1, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as the case may be, to
be satisfied if such failure was caused by such Party\'s failure to use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Closing (subject to the applicable
limitations herein) and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to occur at the Closing or due to the failure of such Party to perform any of
its other obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX 

TERMINATION

Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser;

(b) by either of the Seller Representative or the Purchaser:

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before July 26, 2021
(such date or the date to which it is extended pursuant to this Section
9.1(b)(i) or 

Section 11.11, being the "Outside Date"); provided, however, (x) if there is a
Government Closure that causes the Parties to be unable to make any filing
required under the HSR Act, then the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended day-for-day for each Business Day such Government Closure is in
effect, and (y) that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a Party if the failure of the
Closing to have been consummated on or before the Outside Date was primarily
due to the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement; or

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 8.1(b) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a Party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement or if such Party shall have failed to comply
with its obligations under Section 7.3;

(c) by the Purchaser if the Acquired Companies or the Sellers shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b), respectively, and (ii) cannot be cured by
the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
within 30 days following receipt of written notice from the Purchaser stating
the Purchaser\'s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(c) and the basis for such termination; provided that the Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(c) if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement hereunder; or

(d) by the Seller Representative if the Purchaser shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or
Section 8.3(b), respectively, and (ii) cannot be cured by the Purchaser by the
Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
30 days following receipt of written notice from the Seller Representative
stating the Seller Representative\'s intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) and the basis for such termination; provided
that the Seller Representative shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if the Sellers or the Acquired
Companies are then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement hereunder; provided, further, that the failure to
deliver the Estimated Closing Purchase Price and the other Closing payments
pursuant to Article I at the Closing as required hereunder shall be subject to
cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Seller
Representative.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than this Section 9.2 and Article XI, all of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of
the Purchaser, the Sellers or the Acquired Companies or their respective
managers, directors, employees, 

officers or Affiliates hereunder; provided, however, that no Party shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any
willful breach of this Agreement. For purposes of clarification, if the
Purchaser does not close the Transactions in circumstances in which all of the
closing conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been
satisfied or waived, such event shall be deemed to be a willful breach by the
Purchaser of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if an award of damages is sought
against the Purchaser for any alleged breach of this Agreement by the
Purchaser occurring prior to the Closing, any such award of damages shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall
include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Sellers, which benefit of the
bargain (i.e., expectancy damages) shall be recoverable by the Sellers.

ARTICLE X 

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

Section 10.1 Filing and Amendment of Tax Returns. Except as required by Law,
following the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to not: (a) except in accordance with Section 10.2, file, amend, or
otherwise modify any Pass-Through Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that

owners being liable for incremental Tax pursuant to this Agreement or to any
Governmental Authority or otherwise adversely impact the Tax Returns of the
Sellers or their beneficial owners; (b) engage in any voluntary disclosure or
similar process with any Tax authority with respect to income Taxes

Pass-Through Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; or (f) file an
administrative adjustment request under Section 6227(a) of the Code, or any
similar or successor provision of the Partnership Audit Rules or other Tax Law
in any jurisdiction, in respect of any Pass-Through Tax Return for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. The Acquired Companies shall not take
any action outside the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by
this Agreement on the Closing Date after the Closing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the liquidation of GTCR Blocker) that could reasonably be
expected to result in the Sellers or their beneficial owners being liable for
incremental Tax pursuant to this Agreement or to any Governmental Authority or
otherwise adversely impact the Tax Returns of the Sellers or their beneficial
owners.

Section 10.2 Tax Returns. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared
at its expense all Pass-Through Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and
any Straddle Period that are due after the Closing Date, which shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Acquired
Companies unless otherwise required by Law; provided that (i) items of taxable 

income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Company for the Straddle
Period shall be allocated using the "closing of the books" method (as
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.706-1(c)) as of the end of the
Closing Date, (ii) all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be allocated to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Section
706 of the Code to the extent permitted by Law, (iii) seventy percent (70%) of
any success-based fees allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and deductible at
a more-likely-than-not level of confidence shall be deducted in accordance
with Rev. Proc. 2011-29, (iv) the Purchaser may make or caused to be made an
election under Section 754 of the Code (and any corresponding state or local
Tax election) to the extent such election is not already in effect, and (v)
the Purchaser may make or cause to be made an election pursuant to Section
6221(b) of the Code (and any corresponding state or local Tax election). A
draft of each Pass-Through Tax Return shall be submitted by the Purchaser to
the Seller Representative for review, comment and consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) no later than the date thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for such Pass-Through Tax Return. Any comments
submitted by the Seller Representative to the Acquired Companies no later than
ten (10) days prior to the due date for such Pass-Through Tax Return shall be
considered in good faith by the Purchaser, and the Acquired Companies shall
timely file or cause to be filed such Pass-Through Tax Return with the
applicable Governmental Authority. To the extent permitted or required under
applicable Tax Law, the taxable year of the Acquired Companies shall close as
of the end of the Closing Date.

Section 10.3 Purchase Price Allocation. The portion of the Final Closing
Purchase Price paid with respect to the Company Units, other than the Company
Units held by GTCR Blocker following the Closing (plus any assumed liabilities
and other items required to be taken into account for such purpose) shall be
allocated among the assets of the Company (and, as applicable, any
Subsidiaries treated as flow-through entities for income Tax purposes) in
accordance with Schedule 10.3 of the Disclosure Schedules, the principles of
Sections 743, 755 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder
pursuant to a written allocation delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller
Representative for its review, comment and consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) within one hundred twenty (120) days of the
Closing Date (the "Allocation"). The Purchaser shall consider any timely
received reasonable comments of the Seller Representative in good faith.
Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, the Purchaser, OB
Holdings and the Acquired Companies shall file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the Allocation, as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 10.3 and, if applicable, Section 10.7 and shall not
make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any Tax Return or during the
course of any Tax-related matter, or otherwise take any Tax position
inconsistent with the Allocation unless otherwise required by Law or pursuant
to a good-faith resolution of an audit by a taxing authority. If the Final
Closing Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Allocation
shall be adjusted as appropriate and the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall cooperate in good faith in making any such adjustments.

Section 10.4 Tax Proceedings.

(a) In the event of any audit, assessment, examination, claim or other
controversy or proceeding relating in whole or in part to Pass-Through Tax
Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (a "Tax Proceeding"), the Purchaser shall
inform the Seller Representative of such Tax Proceeding 

as soon as possible but in any event within seven (7) days after the receipt
by the Purchaser of notice thereof.

(b) If the Tax Proceeding relates to a jurisdiction and Tax period to which
the Partnership Audit Rules apply, then, the Seller Representative and the
Sellers shall cooperate with the Acquired Companies and their respective
"partnership representatives" or "designated individuals" as defined under the
Partnership Audit Rules, to, take all actions that may be necessary or
appropriate to prevent any Acquired Company that is taxed as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes from having any liability for an "imputed
underpayment" (within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code) or any interest
or penalty related thereto that is attributable to any item of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
including by cooperating with the Purchaser to cause the Acquired Companies to
make a "push out" election pursuant to Section 6226 of the Code or to elect
under Section 6226(b)(4)(A)(ii)(I) of the Code to furnish statements to its
partners for the "reviewed year" (as defined in Section 6225(d)(1) of the
Code), or make any similar election under any similar or successor provision
of Tax Law in any jurisdiction; provided that none of Purchaser, any Acquired
Company or any Affiliate thereof shall take any action with respect to any
such Tax Proceeding that would require any Seller or its beneficial owners to
amend its income Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period.

(c) With respect to any Tax Proceeding, subject to Section 10.4(b), the
Purchaser shall control the Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith, but
the Purchaser shall not settle or otherwise resolve the Tax Proceeding without
the Seller Representative\'s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and shall keep the Seller Representative
reasonably informed of material developments in any such Tax Proceeding.

Section 10.5 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
registration and real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax,
stock transfer tax and other similar Taxes with respect to the Transactions
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties, interest or other
additions with respect to Transfer Taxes shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by
the Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers. The Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns,
reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of
all applicable Laws in connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes and
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize the amount of any such Transfer
Taxes payable in connection herewith.

Section 10.6 Cooperation. Following the Closing, the Purchaser, the Sellers,
the GTCR Blocker and the Acquired Companies shall cooperate with and make
available to the other Parties, during normal business hours, all books and
records, information and employees (without substantial disruption of
employment) retained and remaining in existence after the Closing that are
necessary or useful in connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns and
any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation or any other matter requiring any such
books and records, information or employees for any reasonable business
purpose. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the GTCR Blocker and
the Acquired Companies to retain all applicable Tax Returns, books and
records, and workpapers for Pre-Closing Tax Periods for a period of at least
seven (7) years following 

the Closing Date. After the Closing, the Seller Representative, Purchaser and
the Company and their Affiliates will use reasonable best efforts to (i)
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Seller Representative (A) a reasonable
estimate of the ordinary income or loss and capital gain or loss allocated to
Seller with respect to Seller's direct or indirect ownership interest in
Optimal Blue Holdings, LLC for Tax periods that include the Closing Date by
February 28 of the following year and (B) ninety (90) days after the end of
such Tax period, final Schedules K-1 with respect to Seller\'s interest in the
Company and Optimal Blue Holdings, LLC that is consistent in all respects with
the information provided pursuant to this clause (i) and (ii) provide the
Seller Representative with any information or estimates reasonably required by
it or its Affiliates for tax reporting purposes promptly upon request by the
Seller Representative.

Section 10.7 Tax Dispute Resolution. In the event of any disagreement as to
(a) the application of any Tax Law relevant to this Agreement (which shall not
include, for the avoidance of doubt, any disagreement as to any matter of
contractual interpretation) or (b) the Allocation, Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve their differences,
provided that if after thirty (30) days, the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser are unable to agree, the parties shall retain a nationally
recognized accounting firm that is mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the
Seller Representative (the "Tax Accounting Firm") to resolve their dispute,
provided that in connection with a dispute related to the Allocation the Tax
Accounting Firm shall utilize the methodologies for determining values as set
forth on Schedule 10.3 of the Disclosure Schedules. The Tax Accounting Firm
shall make a final determination as to the disputed items within thirty (30)
days after such submission and the determination of the Tax Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding on the parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Tax Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Sellers and Purchaser (with the
portion of fees so payable by the Sellers to be paid by the Seller
Representative on behalf of the Sellers) in inverse proportion, as they may
prevail on the disputed items resolved by the Tax Accounting Firm utilizing
the values of such items as initially submitted by the Parties to the Tax
Accounting Firm. Such proportional allocations shall be determined by the Tax
Accounting Firm at the time its determination is rendered on the disputed
items.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties and Certain
Covenants. None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
other agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or

out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations,
agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing (and there shall be
no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those
covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms contemplate
performance in whole or in part after the Closing and then only with respect
to any breaches occurring after the Closing, (b) Article X, (c) Article XI
(but in the case of Section 11.11, solely as applied to covenants and
agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches occurring
after the Closing) and (d) the representations and warranties of the Sellers
set forth in Section 4.3, 

which shall survive for two (2) years following the date of this Agreement. If
no term is specified, each covenant and agreement herein requiring performance
after the Closing, will, in each case, survive for ten (10) years following
the Closing, and nothing in this Section 11.1 will be deemed to limit any
rights or remedies of any Person for breach of any such surviving covenant or
agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Closing.

Section 11.2 Indemnification. From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Purchaser Indemnitees for any and all damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, claims of any kind, interest and expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys) resulting from the failure of the

shall only be required to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnitees to the extent the Purchaser Indemnitees have exhausted the
coverage limits under the Purchaser Insurance Policy\'s limit (to the extent
coverage is actually available under the Purchaser Insurance Policy).

Section 11.3 Acknowledgement by the Purchaser. The Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives) that: (a) it has conducted to its satisfaction its
own independent investigation and verification of the financial condition,
results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected
operations of the Acquired Companies and has been afforded full access to the
books and records, facilities and personnel of the Acquired Companies for
purposes of conducting such investigation and verification, (b) the Acquired
Company Representations constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Acquired Companies in connection with the Transactions, (c)
the Seller Representations constitute the sole and exclusive representations
and warranties of the Sellers in connection with the Transactions, (d) except

Seller Representations by the Sellers, none of the Acquired Companies, the
Sellers or any other Person makes, or has made, any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Sellers, the Acquired Companies
or the Transactions and all other representations and warranties of any kind
or nature expressed or implied (including (i) regarding the completeness or
accuracy of, or any omission to state or to disclose, any information,
including in the estimates, projections or forecasts or any other information,
document or material provided to or made available to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates or Representatives in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of the Transactions,
including meetings, calls or correspondence with management of the Acquired
Companies or the Sellers, and (ii) any relating to the future or historical
business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations,
prospects, assets or liabilities of the Acquired Companies, or the quality,
quantity or condition of the Acquired Companies\' assets) are specifically
disclaimed by the Sellers, the Acquired Companies and all other Persons
(including the Representatives of the Acquired Companies and the Sellers and
its Affiliates and their respective 

Representatives) and (e) the Purchaser and its Affiliates are not relying on
any representations and warranties in connection with the Transactions except
the Acquired Company Representations by the Acquired Companies and the Seller
Representations by the Sellers. In connection with the Purchaser\'s
investigation of the Acquired Companies, the Purchaser has received certain
projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and income
from operations of the Acquired Companies and certain business plan
information. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that the Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties and that the Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Purchaser
hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of the Sellers, the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective current or former Affiliates or
Representatives is making any representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts, and that the Purchaser has not relied on any such estimates,
projections or other forecasts or plans. The Purchaser further acknowledges
and agrees that from and after the Closing, (i) none of the Sellers, the
Acquired Companies, or any other Person shall have or be subject to any
liability to the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to the Purchaser, or the Purchaser\'s use of,
any such estimates, projections or forecasts or any other information,
document or material provided to or made available to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates or Representatives in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of the Transactions and (ii)
the Purchaser and its Affiliates have not relied on any such information,
document or material. Effective upon Closing, the Purchaser waives, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have against the Sellers, the Acquired Companies and any of
their respective current or former Affiliates or Representatives relating to
the operation of the Acquired Companies or their respective businesses or
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or
the Transactions, whether arising under or based upon any federal, state,
local or foreign statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise;
provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice or limit any Fraud
claim or any claim or recovery that may be available to the Purchaser under
the Purchaser Insurance Policy. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it
will not assert, institute or maintain any Action of any kind whatsoever,
including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal or
equitable theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, that makes any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set
forth in this Section 11.3. The Sellers shall have the right to enforce this
Section 11.3 on behalf of any Person that would be benefitted or protected by
this Section 11.3 if they were a party hereto. The foregoing agreements,
acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers are irrevocable.

Section 11.4 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions and this Agreement shall be paid
by the Party incurring or required to incur such fees or expenses. 

Section 11.5 Amendment or Supplement. This Agreement may be amended or
supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the Purchaser and
the Sellers by their duly authorized officers; provided, that such amendment
or supplement is promptly delivered to the other Parties.

Section 11.6 Waiver. At any time prior to the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, any Party may,
subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of any other Party, (b) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or acts of any other Party or (c) waive compliance by
any other Party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as
otherwise provided herein, waive any of such Party\'s conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising
any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a Party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

Section 11.7 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties; provided that, prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser may assign its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to a controlled Affiliate but such assignment shall not relieve the
Purchaser of its obligations or liabilities hereunder and in addition, such
assignee shall be bound by the obligations of Purchaser hereunder as if such
assignee were a party hereto; provided further that (i) following the Closing,
each Party may assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to its
Affiliates but such assignment shall not relieve such Party of its obligations
or liabilities hereunder and (ii) the Purchaser may, without the consent of
any other Party, assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any insurer
that underwrites a Purchaser Insurance Policy in the event of Fraud of any of
the Sellers. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section 11.7 shall be null and void. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 11.7 to the contrary, in the event that the Purchaser
assigns any of its rights or interests under this Agreement to a controlled
Affiliate of Purchaser, the Purchaser shall be the only party to bring any
Action under this Agreement regardless of any such assignment.

Section 11.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to
the other Parties.

Section 11.9 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
including the Disclosure Schedules, Exhibits and Annexes hereto, together with
the other instruments referred to herein or related hereto, including the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Limited Guaranty, dated as of the date
hereof, by and among each of GTCR Co-Invest XI LP, GTCR Fund XI/B LP, and GTCR

Indemnitees and the Sellers under Section 7.7, (ii) the rights of the
Sellers\' Affiliates and Representatives under Section 11.3, (iii) the rights

Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 11.10 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Other than disputes submitted to the Valuation Firm pursuant to Section
2.2 (which shall be addressed in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.2) (i) all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to

Section 11.16 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Exhibit, Annex or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a
Section of, an Exhibit to, an Annex to or Schedule to, this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All references to "$" and dollars in this Agreement shall mean
United States dollars unless otherwise specifically provided. The word "shall"
denotes a directive and obligation, and not an option. The phrases "ordinary
course of business," "ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice" and similar phrases will mean, with respect to any Person, the
ordinary course 

of such Person\'s business consistent with past custom and practice (and
giving effect to any adjustments and modifications thereto taken primarily and
reasonably in response to or as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic). As used in
this Agreement "willful breach" shall mean a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act or failure to act by a party with the actual knowledge
that the taking of such act or failure to act would cause a breach. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have such defined meanings when used in any
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. References to a Person are also to its permitted
assigns and successors. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Acquired
Companies, the Sellers or a Person acting on their behalf, respectively, posts
a document to the online data room hosted on behalf of the Sellers and/or the
Acquired Companies at RR Donnelly Financial Solutions for Project Sapphire,
such document shall be deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished" or "made
available" (or any phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser by the Sellers
and the Acquired Companies, as applicable. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
Unless specified otherwise, any action hereunder to be taken within a certain
number of days shall be taken within that number of calendar days (and not
Business Days); provided, however, that if the last day for taking such action
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the period during which such action
may be taken shall be automatically extended to the next Business Day.

(b) The Disclosure Schedules set forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article
III or Article IV or to one or more of the covenants contained in Article VII,
except that any information set forth in one section of the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to apply to all other sections or subsections
thereof to the extent that the applicability of such information is reasonably
apparent on its face. The Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their entirety
by reference to the specific provisions of the Agreement, and are not intended
to constitute, and shall not be deemed to constitute, representations,
warranties or covenants of the Parties, except as (and solely to the extent)
expressly set forth in the Agreement.

(c) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by
the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules, exhibits or annexes attached hereto is not intended to
imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included,
or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether 

such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened)
or are within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no Party
shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion
of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules, exhibits or annexes
in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described or included in this Agreement or in
the Disclosure Schedules, any exhibit or any annex is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules, exhibits and annexes hereto is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third
party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of
contract).

Section 11.17 No Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the Parties agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non-Recourse Party of a Party
shall have any liability relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions
except as otherwise agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Party. Each
obligation of each Party under this Agreement is a several (and not joint)
obligation and no Party shall be liable for any other Party\'s breach hereof.

Section 11.18 Provision Respecting Legal Representation.

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its respective managers, directors, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that the Acquired Companies and the
Sellers have retained Kirkland and Ellis LLP (and its affiliated entity Kirkland
and Ellis International LLP) (collectively, the "Retained Counsel") to act as
their counsel in connection with the Transactions and that the Retained
Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Party in connection with the
Transactions and that none of the other Parties has the status of a client of
the Retained Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a
result thereof. The Purchaser and the Acquired Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their
respective managers, directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and/or their
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates,
on the other hand, the Retained Counsel may represent the Sellers and/or their
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Sellers or their
Affiliates may be directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or
their Subsidiaries, and even though the Retained Counsel may have represented
the Acquired Companies in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or
any of their Subsidiaries.

(b) The Purchaser agrees that, after the Closing, neither the Purchaser, nor
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will have any right to access or control
any of the Retained Counsel\'s records relating to or affecting the
Transactions with respect to its representation of the Sellers and the
Acquired Companies, which will be the property of (and be controlled by) the
Sellers. In addition, the Purchaser agrees that it would be impractical to
remove all Attorney-Client Communications from the records (including e-mails
and other electronic files) of the Acquired Companies. 

Accordingly, the Purchaser will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Acquired Companies) not to, use
any Attorney-Client Communication remaining in the records of the Acquired
Companies after Closing in a manner that may be adverse to the Sellers or any
of the Sellers\' Affiliates. The Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including, after Closing, Acquired
Companies), that from and after Closing (i) the attorney-client privilege, all
other evidentiary privileges, and the expectation of client confidence as to
all Attorney-Client Communications belong to the Sellers and will not pass to
or be claimed by the Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies,
and (ii) the Sellers will have the exclusive right to control, assert, or
waive the attorney-client privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the
expectation of client confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client
Communications. Accordingly, the Purchaser will not, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Acquired
Companies) not to, (x) assert any attorney-client privilege, other evidentiary
privilege, or expectation of client confidence with respect to any Attorney-
Client Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing dispute with a
Person that is not the Sellers or an Affiliate of the Sellers; or (y) take any
action which could cause any Attorney-Client Communication to cease being a
confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under the attorney-
client privilege or any other evidentiary privilege, including waiving such
protection in any dispute with a Person that is not the Sellers or an
Affiliate of the Sellers.

Section 11.19 Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any
signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby,
and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by
means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the reasonable request of any Party or to any such contract, each other
Party or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to
all other Parties. No Party or to any such contract shall raise the use of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any
such defense.

Section 11.20 Seller Representative.

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Seller
Representative, as his, her or its agent and attorney in fact with full power
of substitution to act from and after the date hereof and to do any and all
things and execute any and all documents on behalf of the Sellers that may be
necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the
Transactions, including: (i) execution of the Escrow Agreement and other
documents and certificates pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;
(ii) receipt of payments under or pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and disbursement thereof to the Sellers, in accordance with this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and subject to the terms hereof or thereof;
(iii) receipt and forwarding of notices and communications pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (iv) administration of the provisions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; (v) giving or agreeing to, on behalf
of the Sellers, any and all consents, waivers, amendments or 

modifications deemed by the Seller Representative, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to be necessary or appropriate under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and the execution or delivery of any documents that may be necessary
or appropriate in connection therewith; (vi) amending this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement or any of the instruments to be delivered to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (vii) taking actions the
Seller Representative is expressly authorized to take pursuant to the other
provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (viii) disputing or
refraining from disputing, on behalf of the Sellers relative to any amounts to
be received by the Sellers under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
agreements contemplated hereby or thereby, any claim made by the Purchaser
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or other agreements contemplated
hereby or thereby; (ix) negotiating and compromising, on behalf of the
Sellers, any dispute that may arise under, and exercising or refraining from
exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby; (x) executing, on
behalf of the Sellers, any settlement agreement, release or other document
with respect to such dispute or remedy; and (xi) engaging attorneys,
accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of the Sellers in connection with
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or thereby and paying any fees related thereto.

(b) The Purchaser shall be fully protected in dealing with the Seller
Representative under this Agreement and may rely upon the authority of the
Seller Representative to act on behalf of the Sellers. Any payment by the
Purchaser to the Seller Representative for the benefit of a Seller shall be
considered a payment by the Purchaser to such Seller. The appointment of the
Seller Representative is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by
the Sellers in any manner or for any reason. This power of attorney shall not
be affected by the death, illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or
other inability to act of the principal pursuant to any applicable law.

(c) The Seller Representative shall not be liable to the Purchaser or any
Seller in its capacity as the Seller Representative, for any liability of a
Seller or for any error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted
by it that it believed to be in good faith or for any mistake in fact or law,
or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreements. The Seller Representative may seek the
advice of legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the
construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement or its duties
hereunder, and, without limiting the foregoing, it shall incur no liability in
its capacity as the Seller Representative to the Purchaser, the Sellers and
shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered
by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

(d) Any expenses or liabilities incurred by the Seller Representative in
connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement shall not be the personal obligation of the Seller
Representative but shall be payable by the Sellers based on the Seller\'s pro-
rata share of the Final Closing Purchase Price. The Seller Representative
shall have the power and authority to set aside and retain additional funds
paid to or received by it, or direct payment of additional funds to be paid to
the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement at Closing or thereafter, to satisfy
such obligations (including to establish such reserves as the Seller 

Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for such costs and
expenses that are not then known or determinable).

(e) The Sellers shall severally, but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless,
based on such Seller\'s pro-rata share of the Final Closing Purchase Price,
the Seller Representative from any and all losses, liabilities and expenses
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in
connection with the Seller Representative\'s execution and performance (solely
in its capacity as the Seller Representative and not in its capacity as a
Seller) of this Agreement.
