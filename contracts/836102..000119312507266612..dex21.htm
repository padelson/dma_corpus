6 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of December 15,
2007, among INGERSOLL-RAND COMPANY LIMITED, a Bermuda corporation (" _Parent_
"), INDIAN MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and TRANE, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the respective Board of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies
and stockholders to consummate the Merger provided for herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

SECTION 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day (as defined in
Section 8.03) after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of
those conditions), at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425
Lexington Ave., New York, New York 10017, unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as required by, and executed
and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_. (a) The Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the " _Company
Certificate_ "), shall be amended at the Effective Time so as to read in its
entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto and, as so amended, such Company
Certificate shall be the certificate  



 

7  of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein and by applicable Law (subject to Section 5.05). 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the Amended Bylaws of the Company shall be amended at
the Effective Time so as to read in their entirety as the Bylaws of Merger Sub
(except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Trane Inc.") and,
as so amended, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to Section 5.05).

SECTION 1.06  _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

SECTION 1.07 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.08 _Directors of Parent_. Upon completion of the Closing, Parent
shall cause to be appointed to the board of directors of Parent, effective as
of the Effective Time, two individuals (the " _Company Director Designees_ ")
from the list of individuals specified in Section 1.08(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule that are mutually agreed by the Company and Parent prior
to the Closing (or if such individuals shall have declined to serve, such
other individuals designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to
Parent). Following the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Company Director Designees are nominated for
election to the Board of Directors of Parent at each of the 2008, 2009 and
2010 annual stockholders meetings of Parent.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
the Companys common stock, $0.01 par value per share (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), or of any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company or Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt, no shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned by a Subsidiary which is directly or indirectly
wholly owned (as defined in Section 8.03) by the Company shall be cancelled
pursuant to this Section 2.01(b).

(c)  _Stock Owned by Subsidiaries_. Each share of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by a Subsidiary which is directly or indirectly wholly
owned by the Company shall remain outstanding, and no payment shall be made in
respect thereof. 

(d) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but excluding (x) shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.01(b), (y) shares to remain outstanding in accordance with  



 

8  Section 2.01(c) and (z) any Dissenting Shares) together with the associated
rights (the " _Company Rights_ ") issued pursuant to the Company Rights Plan
(as hereinafter defined) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.23
(such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.01(d), the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Class A
common share, par value $1.00 per share (" _Parent Common Share_ "), of
Parent, together with the requisite number of rights issued pursuant to the
Parent Rights Plan (as hereinafter defined) (such number of shares, as may be
adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.01(d), the " _Stock Consideration_ "), and
(ii) $36.50 in cash, without interest (such amount of cash, as may be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 2.01(d), the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together
with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Prior to the
Closing Date, and in any event at least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Parent and the Company shall consult and discuss in good faith in an
effort to reach a mutual determination as to whether the condition set forth
in Section 6.01(b) can be satisfied without the requirement of a vote of
Parents stockholders, and in connection with such consultation, the parties
hereto shall provide each other, or cause their respective Representatives
(including their transfer agents) to provide access to all relevant and
supporting documentation reasonably necessary to make such determination. If
(i) Parent and Company agree upon such determination, or (ii) if Parent or the
Company reasonably determines in good faith, following such consultation and
review of such supporting documentation, that it is necessary in order to
satisfy the condition in Section 6.01(b) without the requirement of a vote of
Parents stockholders, and in the case of clause (ii), either party provides
notice to the other party of such determination and the basis
and calculations upon which such determination was made, Parent shall, prior
to the Closing, modify the Merger Consideration by substituting such amount of
additional Cash Consideration, up to $1.00, in lieu of a portion of, and
appropriately reducing, the Stock Consideration (and appropriate adjustment
to the Exchange Ratio) using a fixed value per Parent Common Share equal to
the Parent Reference Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be entitled to make such determination if
the Company is in material breach of Section 3.01(c)(ii) or Section
4.01(a)(ii). At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.01(d) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b), without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Shares shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect such action. The right of any holder of a Certificate to receive
the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) shall, to the extent provided in Section
2.02(j), be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is
required under applicable Tax Law.

(e) _Dissenting Shares_.

(i) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted
in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are entitled to demand and have
properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to
only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided,
however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect
or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders Dissenting Shares in respect of
which the stockholder would otherwise be  



 

9  entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been canceled at the Effective Time, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (payable without any
interest thereon) as compensation for such cancellation.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any notice received by
the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments or notices
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (B) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise
of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as otherwise required by an
Order or under applicable Law, (x) make any payment or other commitment
with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights, (y) offer to settle or
settle any such rights or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal
rights in accordance with the DGCL.

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
_"Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates,
certificates representing Parent Common Shares and cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration required to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.01(d) in the aggregate amount equal to the number of Parent Common
Shares and amount of cash into which such shares of Company Common Stock have
been converted. In addition, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as
necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e). All Parent Common
Shares, cash, dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the
_"Exchange Fund_." 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in no event later than three Business Days following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form
and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e).
Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.01(d), (ii) a certificate or certificates representing
that number of whole Parent Common Shares (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.01(d), (iii) any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (iv) cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this  



 

10  Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
payment to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Company Common Stock that holds such shares in book-entry (rather
than though a Certificate) shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent in order to receive
the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Article II.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to Parent Common Shares that the holder thereof has
the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional Parent Common Shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant
to Section 2.02(e), in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall
have surrendered such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
Following the surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificate representing whole Parent Common Shares issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Common
Shares and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Parent
Common Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(e) paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or
made by the Company on the shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
it shall be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to
such fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been
entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share shall receive in lieu thereof
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by all Certificates surrendered by such
holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share closing price of
Parent Common Shares on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, as such price is reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape (as
reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the parties
shall agree in writing prior to the Effective Time).

(f) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall  



 

11  thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) in accordance with
this Article II.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Parent Common Shares, dividends or other distributions from the Exchange
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not
have been surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration
(and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares (and any
dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent in (i) direct obligations
of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of
all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving
the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), in each case pursuant to this Article II.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent determine are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to

such Significant Subsidiary owned by the Company have been validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances or
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (other than liens, charges
and encumbrances for current Taxes not yet due and payable) (collectively, "
_Liens_ "), other than Permitted Liens, and free of any restriction on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity
interests (other than restrictions imposed by securities Laws). Except for
the Subsidiaries of the Company, the Company does not own, directly or

formal or informal governmental inquiries or investigations or
investigations, in each case regarding accounting or disclosure practices of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or regarding compliance by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries with any Law except for those inquiries or investigations
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(l) _Compliance With Law; Environmental Matters_. (i) Except for those matters
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(A) each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is and has been since January 1, 2005
in compliance with all Laws and Orders applicable to it, its properties or
other assets or its business or operations;

(B) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has in effect all Permits, including
Permits under Environmental Laws, necessary for it to own, lease or operate
its properties and other assets and to carry on its business and operations as
currently conducted;

(C) there has been no violation of any such Permit;

(D) to Parents Knowledge, (1) the consummation of the Merger would not cause
the revocation, modification or cancellation of any such Permit, and (2) no
Governmental Entity has communicated with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
a way that indicates that the revocation, modification or cancellation of any
such Permit would reasonably be expected;

(E) to the Knowledge of Parent, (1) there have been no Releases of Hazardous
Materials and Hazardous Materials are not otherwise present in, on, under,
from or affecting any properties or facilities currently or formerly owned,
leased or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would subject
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability under any Environmental
Law, or adversely affect any current or planned operations of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries at any such properties or facilities and (2) none of Parent
or its Subsidiaries has Released, or is responsible for, Hazardous Materials
at any other location which would subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
any liability under Environmental Law; and

(F) to Parents Knowledge, none of the officers, directors, or agents (in
their capacity as such) of Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is,
or since January 1, 2006, has been, in violation of any Law applicable to its
business, properties or operations and relating to (1) the use of corporate
funds relating to political activity or for the purpose of obtaining or
retaining business; (2) payments to government officials or employees from
corporate funds; or (3) bribes, rebates, payoffs, influence payments, or
kickbacks.

(ii) To Parents Knowledge, (a) it is in compliance in all material respects
with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and any other United States and
foreign Laws concerning corrupt payments; and (b) between January 1, 2003 and
the date of this Agreement, Parent has not been investigated by any
Governmental Entity with respect to, or given notice by an Governmental
Entity of, any violation by Parent of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any
other United States or foreign Laws concerning corrupt payments.

(m) _Financing_. Section 3.02(m) of Parents Disclosure Schedule contains
true, correct and complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of
executed commitment letters, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Debt Commitment Letters_ "), from the lenders named therein to provide debt
financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively
referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). None of the Debt Commitment Letters
has been amended or modified in any material respect (or, in respect of terms
relating to conditionality or amounts, amended in any respect on terms that
are less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub), no such amendment or modification
is contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in such letters have
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letters
are in full force and effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and  



 

33  Merger Sub, and to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The
net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing, together with the proceeds
of commercial paper or loans under existing revolving credit facilities of
Parent and cash on hand of Parent at the Closing, will in the aggregate be
sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
(and any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters) and any other amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
under the Debt Commitment Letters, and, as of the date of this Agreement,
Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be
available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing. The Debt
Commitment Letters contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the parties thereunder to make the Debt Financing available to Parent on
the terms therein.

(n) _Certain Agreements_. Prior to the Board of Directors of the Company
approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other person, was at any time, or
became, an "interested stockholder" thereunder or has taken any action that
would cause any anti-takeover statute under the DGCL or other applicable state
Law to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any direct
or indirect beneficial ownership, or sole or shared voting power, with respect
to any shares of Company Common Stock.

(o) _No Parent Vote Required_. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.01(c) and
(ii) compliance by the Company with Section 4.01(a)(ii), no vote or other
action of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is
required by Law, the Parent Certificate, the Parent Bye-Laws or otherwise in
order for Parent and Merger Sub to adopt this Agreement, approve the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

regard to any United States Federal income Taxes, any income Taxes imposed by
the Netherlands or any Tax Returns with respect to any such Taxes;

(vi) No written notice of a claim of pending investigation has been received
from any state, local or other jurisdiction with which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries currently does not file Tax Returns, alleging that Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries has a duty to file Tax Returns and pay Taxes or is
otherwise subject to the Taxing Authority of such jurisdiction;



 

34 (vii) During the two year period prior to the Spin-Off, Parent had not engaged
in discussions with the Company and/or its Affiliates with regard to a
potential acquisition of the Company by Parent and/or its Affiliates; and

(viii) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any

(q) _No Additional Representations; Disclaimer_.

(i) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger
Sub in this Section 3.02, neither Parent nor any other person makes any
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or its
Subsidiaries or their respective business, operations, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent hereby disclaims

person makes or has made any representation or warranty to the Company or any
of their Affiliates or representatives with respect to (i) any financial
projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information relating to
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, or (ii) any
oral or written information presented to the Company or any of their
Affiliates or representatives in the course of their due diligence
investigation of Parent, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that it (i) has had the
opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss the
business, assets and liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) has
had access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and
other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries which it and its
representatives have desired or requested to review, (iii) has been afforded
the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from officers of the
Company, and (iv) has conducted its own independent investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, their respective businesses, assets, liabilities
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the

Section 3.01 hereof, including any implied representation or warranty as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company
furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that no representations or warranties are

the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations
hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, the Company will coordinate with Parent
regarding the declaration of any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Company Common Stock and the related record dates and payment
dates, it being intended that Company stockholders will not receive more than
one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar
quarter on their shares of Company Common Stock (including the Parent Common
Shares received in exchange therefor in the Merger).

(e) _Advice of Changes_. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise the
other party, orally and in writing, if (i) any representation or warranty
made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Merger Sub) contained in this
Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate in a manner that would or would be
reasonably likely to result in the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.03(a), or (ii) it (and, in the case of Parent,
Merger Sub) fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (and,
in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) under this Agreement; _provided, however_
, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. In
addition, in connection with any notice delivered by Parent pursuant to this
Section 4.01(e) at the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall afford
to the Company and its Representatives, reasonably access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice during the period prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to Parents and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, personnel and records as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request to the extent such access or
information is reasonably related to Parents or Merger Subs compliance with
the terms of this Agreement or in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) _Certain Tax Matters_. Other than in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to not, without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), make or change any material Tax
election, change an annual accounting period, adopt or change any material
accounting method with respect to Taxes, file any material amended
Tax Return, enter into any material closing agreement, settle or compromise
any proceeding with respect to any  



 

39  material Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, surrender any right to claim a refund of material Taxes, or
consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any
material Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.02 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company agrees that it shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to direct its and
its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives,
including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other advisor, agent, representative (acting in such capacity) or controlled
Affiliate (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly
through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or
knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or the making or consummation
thereof, or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions (except to notify such person of the existence of the provisions
of this Section 4.02) or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information in connection with, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way
with, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify,
waive or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar
obligation of any person if the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to direct its and
its Subsidiaries Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona
fide written Takeover Proposal, (A) the Company and its Representatives may
contact such person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company and its
Representatives may, subject to compliance with this Section 4.02, (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive in the aggregate to
such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any standstill
or similar obligation), _provided_ that all such information has previously
been provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives or is
provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any person
(other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) relating to, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more
of any class of equity securities of the Company, or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, pursuant to which any
person or the stockholders of any person would own 15% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting parent company of the
Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide offer made by a third
party (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) that if
consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders) owning,  



 

40  directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or
the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or more
than 50% of the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent pursuant to Section 4.02(d)) to be (i) more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms set forth in the proposal.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent the
Company Recommendation, or (B) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, a Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause (A) or (B) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); (ii) allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar
Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
4.02(a)) providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any
Takeover Proposal; or (iii) waive any provision of, terminate, amend or
otherwise modify the Company Rights Plan or redeem the Company Rights (other
than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and subject to compliance with Section 4.02(d), the Board
of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Any Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall
not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Board
of Directors of the Company in any respect that would have the effect of
causing any Delaware corporate takeover statute to be applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

(c) Without limiting Section 4.02(b), in response to a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(f) and this Section 4.02(c) and, concurrently with such
termination, may enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) and this Section 4.02(c), and any
such purported termination shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the
Company (x) complies with its obligations set forth in Section 4.02(d), and
(y) pays to Parent the fee payable pursuant to Section 5.06(c) prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(f) and Section 4.02(c), (x) unless the Company shall have
provided to Parent three calendar days prior written notice (such notice, a "
_4.02(d)_ _Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor and
(y):

(i) if such Company Adverse Recommendation Change is not being made as a
result of a Superior Proposal, during such three day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that would otherwise obviate the
need for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

(ii) if such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination is being
made as a result of a Superior Proposal, (1) the 4.02(d) Notice shall specify
the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal and the identity of
the person making the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the financial terms of any such Superior Proposal
(including any revision in price) shall require a new 4.02(d) Notice and a new
24 hour period), and (2) during such  



 

41  three day period (or 24 hour period in the case of such amendment), if
requested by Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations
with Parent regarding any amendment to this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent.

(e) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with,
Section 7.01, and subject to Section 5.01(b), (i) the obligation of the
Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys stockholders on the adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not
be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to it of any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal), or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) in any case
in which the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
this Section 4.02, (A) the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement
and the Merger to a vote of its stockholders and (B) the Proxy Statement and
any and all accompanying materials may include appropriate disclosure with
respect to such Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

(f) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b), (c) and (d) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes
thereto) and the identity of the person making the Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all written material sent or provided to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the person making such Takeover
Proposal that describes any of the material terms or conditions of any such
Takeover Proposal.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make such disclosure could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with
applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that compliance with such rules shall
in no way limit or modify the effect that any such action pursuant to such
rules has under this Agreement; it being understood that "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
stockholders of the Company) shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

SECTION 5.01 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company
Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the
Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable cooperation) and file with
the SEC the proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating
to the meeting of the Companys stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders 
Meeting_") to be held to consider adoption of this Agreement and (ii) Parent
shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, and, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4,
Parent shall take all action reasonably required (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction  



 

42  in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service
of process) to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Shares in the Merger. Each of
Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably
requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly
as practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement will made by the Company, in each case without
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension
of the qualification of Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger and all orders of
the SEC relating to the Form S-4.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective, the Company shall take all actions necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting solely for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the Company
Stockholders Meeting to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
reasonably believes that such delay or postponement is consistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Subject to Section 4.02, the Company
shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption
of this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement
(the " _Company Recommendation_ ").

SECTION 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall afford to
Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access (including for the
purpose of coordinating transition planning with the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice to the Company during the period prior to the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries
properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent may
from time to time reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company
shall furnish promptly to Parent (x) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and (y) all
other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. If any of the information or
material furnished pursuant to this Section 5.02 includes materials or
information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal
proceedings or governmental investigations, each party understands and agrees
that the parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters,
and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the parties that
the sharing of such material or information is not intended to, and shall not,
waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or
information or its continued protection under the  



 

43  attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information provided by the Company that is entitled to
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under
these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and its Representatives shall not have the
right to conduct environmental testing or sampling at any of the facilities or
properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and share
information during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement relating to each such partys capitalization structure for
purposes of evaluating whether any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio and Cash
Consideration, as contemplated by Section 2.01(d), may be required in order
to satisfy the condition in Section 6.01(b) without the requirement of a vote
of Parents stockholders.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold, and shall cause their
respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to
hold, all information received from the other party, directly or indirectly,
in confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject
to, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of
November 6, 2007 between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "); _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in
Section 9 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be inapplicable with respect
to any of the transactions set forth in this Agreement or any proposals or
negotiations by Parent during the period specified in Section 4.02(d) in
connection with its rights described therein. The Confidentiality Agreement,
including the restrictions set forth in Section 9 of the Confidentiality
Agreement, shall survive any termination of this Agreement. No investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any party
hereto pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or
warranties of the parties hereto or the conditions to the Closing, in each
case, contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 5.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Action_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (i) to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof but in any event no later than fifteen
Business Days after the date hereof, (ii) to make all necessary notifications,
registrations or filings pursuant to any applicable Antitrust Law (other
than the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof but in any event no later than
thirty Business Days after the date hereof, (iii) to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law and (iv) to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods with respect to
the approval of the Merger under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
5.03(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of the status of matters related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including furnishing the other with any written notices or
other communications received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade  



 

44  Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other United States or foreign Governmental
Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences in
accordance with Antitrust Law. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "
_Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, Foreign
Antitrust Laws and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes,
rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and
other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition, and (B) " _Foreign
Antitrust Laws_ " means the applicable requirements of antitrust competition
or other similar Laws, rules, regulations and judicial doctrines
of jurisdictions other than the United States.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in Sections 5.03(a) and (b), each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law, including using reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed). Neither party
shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to
acquire any business, person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets or enter into any other transaction if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition or other transaction would be reasonably likely to materially
increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable clearance, approval or
waiver from a Governmental Entity charged with the enforcement of any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or materially delay obtaining such clearances, approvals or waivers.

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary and without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit
to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit
to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is
accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, any of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order,
or other order in any suit or proceeding by a Governmental Entity, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that Parent shall not be required to take any such actions which
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(including for this purpose the Surviving Corporation, the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Subsidiaries of Parent but excluding for this purpose clause
(ii) of the definition thereof).



 

45 SECTION 5.04 _Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) _Incentive Plan Options_.

(i) _Converted Incentive Options_. All Incentive Plan Options, whether or not
exercisable or vested at the Effective Time, shall be, as of the Effective
Time, fully vested and exercisable. Except (1) with respect to Cash Election
Options under the Companys Stock Incentive Plan and (2) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to Incentive Plan Options held by the
Specified Option Holders that are required to be cashed-out pursuant to the
pro-ration mechanics described in Section 5.04(d)(ii)(B), all Incentive Plan
Options (including France Options under the Companys Stock Incentive Plan,
but excluding ISOs), shall be, as of the Effective Time,
converted automatically into options to purchase Parent Common Shares ("
_Converted Incentive Options_ ") upon the same terms and conditions as are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Incentive
Plan Option (including any such terms and conditions which become effective
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
including, for the avoidance of doubt, provisions in the Companys Stock
Incentive Plan relating to the put right and cash settlement of Incentive
Plan Options following a "Change of Control," as defined therein), except that
(i) each such Converted Incentive Option shall be exercisable for, and
represent the right to acquire, that whole number of Parent Common Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Incentive Plan Option multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio and (ii) subject to Section 5.04(g), the option price
per Parent Common Share under each Converted Incentive Option shall be an
amount equal to the quotient of (A) the option price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to the related Incentive Plan Option, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Option Exchange
Ratio (the option price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the
nearest full cent).

(ii) _Cashed-Out Incentive Options_. As of the Effective Time, (1) each Cash
Election Option under the Companys Stock Incentive Plan and (2) each
Incentive Plan Option held by the Specified Option Holders that is required to
be cashed-out pursuant to the pro-ration mechanics described in Section
5.04(d)(ii)(B) shall be converted into a right to receive a payment in cash,
payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (a) (i)
the excess, if any, of (x) the Cash Consideration plus (y) the product of (1)
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (2) Parent Reference Price over (ii) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option (such cash amount for each such Company Stock
Option, the " _Cash-Out Amount_ ").

(b) _Omnibus Plan Options_.

(i) _Cashed-Out Omnibus Options_. All Omnibus Plan Options, whether or not
exercisable or vested at the Effective Time, shall be, as of the Effective
Time, fully vested and exercisable. Subject to Section 5.04(b)(ii), (c) and
(d), as of the Effective Time, each Omnibus Plan Option (other than ISOs and
France Options), shall, subject to the terms of the Companys 2002 Omnibus
Incentive Plan, be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash,
payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the Cash-Out Amount
with respect to each such Omnibus Plan Option.

(ii) _Converted Omnibus Options_. Subject to Section 5.04(c) and 5.04(d), the
Roll-Over Election Options and the France Options that are, in each case,
Omnibus Plan Options shall be, as of the Effective Time, converted
automatically into options to purchase Parent Common Shares (" _Converted
Omnibus Options_ ," and together with the Converted Incentive Options, the "
_Converted Options_ ") upon the same terms and conditions as are in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Omnibus Plan
Options (including any such terms and conditions which become effective
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except
that (i) each such Converted Omnibus Option shall be exercisable for, and
represent the right to acquire, that whole number of Parent Common Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of  



 

46  Company Common Stock subject to such Omnibus Plan Option multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio and (ii) subject to Section 5.04(g), the option price
per Parent Common Share under each Converted Omnibus Option shall be an amount
equal to the quotient of (A) the option price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to the related Omnibus Plan Option in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio (the option
price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest full cent).

(c) _Option Election_. An election form and other appropriate and customary
materials in such form as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (the "
_Option Election Form_ ") shall be mailed within five days of mailing of the
Proxy Statement to each holder of record of a Company Stock Option (other than
ISOs, which shall be treated in the manner provided in Section 5.04(f) and
other than France Options, which shall be automatically converted into
Converted Options). Each Election Form shall permit the holder to specify and
elect: (i) to have all or a portion (determined on a grant-by-grant basis) of
the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option converted at the Effective Time into the Cash-Out Amount applicable to
such option in accordance with Section 5.04(a)(ii) or Section 5.04(b)(i) (a "
_Cash-Out Election_ "), or (ii) to have all or a portion (determined on a
grant-by-grant basis) of the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option converted at the Effective Time into the applicable
Converted Option in accordance with Section 5.04(a)(i) or Section 5.04(b)(ii)
(a " _Roll-Over Election_ "). Any such election shall have been properly made
only if the Company shall have received a properly completed Option Election
Form by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Option Calculate Date. An Option
Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if duly executed by the
holder of such Company Stock Option, together with any other materials
required to be submitted in accordance with the instructions set forth in the
Option Election Form. Any Option Election Form may be revoked or modified by
the person submitting such form, only by written notice to the Company
received prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Option Calculation Date. In
the event (A) an Option Election Form is revoked prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern
Time on the Option Calculation Date and a subsequently properly completed
Option Election Form is thereafter received by the Company prior to 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the Option Calculation Date, or (B) the Company has not
received an effective, properly completed, Option Election Form on or before
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Option Calculation Date with respect to any
specified Company Stock Option, then, in each case, the holder of such Company
Stock Options with respect to which no valid election has been made in
accordance with this Section 5.04(c) shall be deemed to be neither a Cash-Out
Election nor a Roll-Over Election in respect of such Company Stock Options
held by such holder. 

(d) _Proration_.

(i) The Automatic Rollover Options shall be converted into Converted Options
in accordance with Section 5.04(a)(i) (in the case of Converted Incentive
Options), Section 5.04(b)(ii) (in the case of Converted Omnibus Options) or
Section 5.04(f) (in the case of ISOs).

(ii) If (x) the number of Automatic Rollover Options plus (y) the number of
Company Stock Options held by the Specified Option Holders (the sum of (x) and
(y), the " _Total Rollover Base Number_ ") exceeds the Maximum Rollover
Number, the Company Stock Options held by the Specified Option Holders shall
be treated in the following manner:

(A) a cash-out proration factor shall be equal to a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Total Rollover Base Number _minus_ the Maximum Rollover Number
and the denominator of which is the number of Company Stock Options held by
the Specified Option Holders (such factor, the " _Cash-Out Proration Factor_
").

(B) with respect to each Specified Option Holder, a number of Company Stock
Options equal to the Cash-Out Proration Factor multiplied by the number of
Company Stock Options held by each such Specified Option Holder shall be
converted into the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount (in lieu of
Converted Options) in accordance with this Section 5.04; it being understood
that such Company Stock Options held by the Specified Option Holder that are
 



 

47  converted into the applicable Cash-Out Amount shall be selected pro rata
among the Specified Option Holders based on the relative number of Company
Stock Options held by such holders, with the Company Stock Options of each
Specified Option Holder having the earliest grant date being cashed out first
pursuant to this clause (B).

(C) the remaining Company Stock Options held by the Specified Option Holders
shall be converted into Converted Options in accordance with Section
5.04(a)(i) (in the case of Converted Incentive Options) or Section 5.04(b)(ii)

holders of Cash Election Options (in respect of such Cash Election Options)
and to the Specified Option Holders (in respect of the Company Stock Options
held by such Specified Option Holders that are required to be cashed-out
pursuant to Section 5.04(d)(ii)(B)), the Cash-Out Amount applicable to such
holder in respect of such Company Stock Options under this Section 5.04 (less

Days thereafter.

shall be, as of the Effective Time, converted automatically into options to
purchase shares of Parent Common Shares (" _Converted ISOs_ ") upon the same
terms and conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
with respect to such ISOs (including any such terms and conditions which

(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such ISO multiplied by the ISO Exchange Ratio
and (ii) the option price per Parent Common Share under each Converted ISO
shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the option price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to the related ISO in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by (B) the ISO Exchange Ratio (the option price per
share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest full cent). For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _ISO Exchange Ratio_ " shall be the quotient
of (1) the Company Reference Price divided by (2) the Parent Reference Price.

(g) _Converted Options Exercise Price Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary above, to the extent that the application of the portion of the
formula set forth in clause (ii) of the second sentence of Section 5.04(a)(i)
or clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 5.04(b)(ii) results in a
Converted Option with an Option Spread (based on the closing price of Parent
Common Shares on the Closing Date) which is greater than or lesser than the
Option Spread of the related Company Stock Option (based on the closing price
of Company Common Stock on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date),
the exercise price per Parent Common Share subject to such Converted Option
shall be adjusted up or down, as the case may be, so that the Option Spread of
the Converted Option is equal the Option Spread in the related Company
Stock Option.

(h) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except as separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof (which agreement
shall then govern such award), each award of Company Restricted Stock Units
and any accrued dividends shall vest in full and be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(d). The
Surviving Corporation will vest and pay all dividends accrued on such Company
Restricted Stock Units to the holders thereof within five Business Days after
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
entitled to effect amendments to any Company Restricted Stock Unit which is
subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code to permit the payment of
the Merger Consideration to the holder of such Company Restricted Stock Unit
in the manner set forth in this Section 5.04(c) without the imposition of
Taxes on the holder of the Company Restricted Stock Unit pursuant to the
operation of Section 409A of the Code or, if it is not possible to effect such
amendments, to provide for the payment of the Merger Consideration to the
holder of the Company Restricted Stock Unit upon the earliest date following
Effective Time which will not cause an  



 

48  imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code. Parent shall, following
the Effective Time, comply with the determinations of the Company

payout of Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Restricted Stock

of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the

50 (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving

Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and
accurate copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms

policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) the Company
may substitute therefor a single premium tail policy with respect to such

conditions at least as favorable to the directors and officers covered under
such insurance policy as the limits, terms and conditions in the existing
policies of the Company; or (ii) if the Company does not substitute as
provided in clause (i) above, then Parent may (A) substitute therefor policies
of Parent, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier, containing terms with respect to
coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and
amounts no less favorable to such directors and officers or (B) request that
the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in connection with this Section 5.05(c), neither the Company
nor Parent shall pay a one-time premium (in connection with a single premium
tail policy described above) in excess of the amount set forth in Section
5.05(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or be obligated to pay annual
premiums (in connection with any other directors and officers insurance policy
described above) in excess of the annual premiums set forth in Section
5.05(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. It is understood and agreed
that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or less,
then the Company shall obtain the maximum amount of coverage as may be
obtained for such amount.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification

obligations of Parent set forth in third, fourth and fifth sentences of

Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, except that expenses incurred in connection
with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement

funds on the first Business Day following the date of such termination of this
Agreement.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to

intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, and, in
each case, not publicly withdrawn at the time of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i), 7.01(b)(iii), 7.01(e)(ii) or 7.01(e)(iii), and
(iii) within 9 months after any such termination referred to in clause (ii)
above, the Company enters into a definitive Contract with respect to, or
consummates, any Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether such Takeover
Proposal is the same Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (i) above), then
the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same
day  



 

51  funds, on the date of the first to occur of such event(s) referred to above
in this sentence; _provided_ that, for purposes of this sentence,
each reference to "15% or more" in the definition of the term " _Takeover_
_Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority."

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in this Section 5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly if the Company fails to pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 5.06 in the time period contemplated hereby, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to
Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made.

(f) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (x) if Parent receives the Termination Fee from the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.06, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and
any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates and none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current
or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or
Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (y)
if Parent or Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company in respect of
any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent is entitled to receive the
Termination Fee under this Section 5.06, the amount of such Termination
Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the
Company to Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any such breaches of this
Agreement.

SECTION 5.07 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or any action taken pursuant thereto, and in accordance with
Section 4.02, so long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by

shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such person to deliver to
Parent at least 30 days prior to the Closing Date a written agreement
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto; _provided_ , _that_
such obligation shall cease to exist if, and to the extent, that Rule 145
under the Securities Act is amended after the date of this Agreement and
prior to 30 days before the Closing Date in a manner that obviates the need
for such persons to deliver the written agreement in the form attached as
Exhibit C hereto.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Shares (including derivative securities with

Benefit Plans; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt
any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of capital
stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect

exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements;
_provided, further_ , that no plans or arrangements of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries providing for such issuance shall be taken into account in
determining whether employee benefits are no less favorable in the aggregate.

shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person.

Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,

conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties

provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys
independent auditors, counsel and other Representatives to provide, all
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ , that the

occasions with rating agencies, prospective lenders and investors in
presentations, meetings and due diligence sessions, (ii) to provide reasonable
and customary management and legal representations to auditors and (iii)
to provide reasonable assistance with the preparation of business projections

senior management to carry out their duties to the Company), (b) otherwise
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing
sources for any of the Debt Financing, (c) upon request, furnishing Parent and
its financing sources with such financial and other pertinent information

be reasonably requested by Parent, (d) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain legal opinions relating to the Debt Financing as may reasonably be
requested by Parent, (f) using reasonable best efforts to provide and execute
necessary documents and certificates (including certificates of the chief
financial officer of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to
financing matters), as may be reasonably requested by Parent and (g) using
reasonable best efforts to cause its independent accountants to provide
assistance and cooperation with Parent and in the preparation of an offering
document for the Debt Financing; _provided, however,_ that, in each case, no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers or Representatives under any certificate, document,
instrument or agreement shall be effective or be binding on the Company, such
Subsidiary or Representative prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_further_ , all non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding
the Company obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives pursuant
to this Section 5.14 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub shall be
permitted to disclose such information to potential syndicate members during
syndication, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such
potential syndicate members, and Parent shall be responsible for any
breach thereof by such syndicate members. Parent shall promptly, upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out of pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, officers, employees, advisors or other Representatives in
connection with their respective obligations pursuant to this Section 5.14.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information used
in connection therewith. In no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any

SECTION 7.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;

Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in

Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.05 _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant
