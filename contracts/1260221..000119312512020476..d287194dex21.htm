11 (ii) _Dollars_. Any reference in this Agreement to "$" shall mean U.S.
dollars. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Exhibits or Schedules is
not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of
the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any
dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any
obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any
schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

(iii) _Exhibits/Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are
hereby incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral part of this

any matter or item disclosed on one Schedule shall be deemed to have been
disclosed on each other Schedule, in which it is readily apparent on the face
of such disclosure that the information is required to be included.
Disclosure of any item on any Schedule shall not constitute an admission or
indication that such item or matter is material or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No disclosure on a Schedule
relating to a possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order shall
be construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit
but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this
Agreement.

include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall

utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any " _Section_ " are to the corresponding Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified.

(vi) _Herein_. The words such as " _herein_ ," " _hereinafter_ ," " _hereof_
," and " _hereunder_ " refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a
subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

(vii) _Including_. The word " _including_ " or any variation thereof means
(unless the context of its usage otherwise requires) " _including, without
limitation_ " and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that
it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following

specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be " _reflected_ on"
or " _set_

 



12   _forth in_ " a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent any
such phrase appears in such representation or warranty, if (A) there is a
reserve, accrual or other similar item underlying a number on such balance
sheet or financial statements that related to the subject matter of such
representation, (B) such item is otherwise specifically set forth on the
balance sheet or financial statements or (C) such item is reflected on the
balance sheet or financial statements and is specifically set forth in the
notes thereto.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time Merger

date shall be no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or

in no event earlier than February 17, 2012, at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP, 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02110, unless another

which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ". 

2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed in accordance
with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by
the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts,

 



13  liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.
The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law (and subject to _Section 6.6_ hereof). 

2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. 

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.7 _Conversion of Stock and Options_.

(a) Each share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company
(the " _Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be canceled in
accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_) shall be converted into the right to
receive:

(i) an amount in cash (the " _Closing Per Share Price_ ") equal to the
quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the Merger Consideration _minus_ the
Holdback, by (B) the total number of Fully Diluted Shares, _plus_

(ii) an amount in cash (the " _Post-Closing Per Share Price_ ") equal to the
quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the remainder of the Holdback, if any,
following the adjustments made pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_, _plus_ the
amount of any positive adjustment payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section
3.2(e)_, by (B) the total number of Fully Diluted Shares.

The foregoing amounts will be payable to the holder thereof without interest
in accordance with _Section 3.1_. From and after the Effective Time, all such
shares of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates (a " _Stockholder_ "), which represented Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Certificates_ "), shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Per Share Price therefor, without interest thereon.

 



14 (b) Each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to
the extent unexercisable, become fully exercisable and shall be cancelled, in
each case effective at the Effective Time, in exchange for a cash payment or
payments from the Surviving Corporation to the holder of such Option (an "
_Optionholder_ ") equal to the Net Exercise Value (net of the amount of any
loans from the Company to such Optionholder then outstanding) (the " _Closing
Option Payment_ "), _plus_ , the product of (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Option, _multiplied_ by (y) the Post-Closing Per Share
Price (such payments to be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section 3.3_), subject to the terms of this Agreement as applicable and
payable at the same times as, payments of the Closing Per Share Price and
Post-Closing Per Share Price are payable to Stockholders pursuant to _Section
2.7(a)_.

(c) Each share of Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
automatically canceled and extinguished without any exchange thereof and
without any further action on the part of the Company.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation so that, immediately after the Effective Time, the
stockholder of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
holder of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the holder of which: (i) has not consented to the Merger in
writing and has not waived its rights to appraisal in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL; (ii) has demanded its rights to appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenters  Rights_"); and (iii) has not
effectively withdrawn or lost its Dissenters Rights to appraisal (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Closing Per Share Price and the Post-Closing Per Share Price. By
virtue of the Merger, all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and shall cease
to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided
under the DGCL. If any holder of shares of Common Stock who demands
Dissenters Rights shall effectively withdraw or lose the right to dissent or
its right of appraisal, then, at the later of the Effective Time and
the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive the Closing Per Share Price and the Post-Closing Per Share Price. The
Company shall give the Stockholders Representatives notice of any written
demands for Dissenters Rights of any shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company which relate thereto. In addition, the Company shall
give the Stockholders Representatives the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings (subject to the Companys right to object to any
actions or positions taken by the Stockholders Representatives that it deems
unreasonable) with respect to demands for Dissenters Rights. The Stockholders
and Optionholders shall be severally, but not jointly, liable for any
obligation of the Company 

 



15  to pay the fair value of shares of Common Stock determined in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (including interest thereon if awarded by the
court), the costs of any proceedings relating to appraisal rights and any
settlement of any such proceeding; _provided_ , that the Company shall be
entitled to seek reimbursement from the Stockholders Representatives for any
such payments; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Stockholders
Representatives shall be entitled, on behalf of the Stockholders not
exercising Dissenters Rights and the Optionholders, to pay, or direct the
Exchange Agent to pay, any such reimbursement amounts from that portion of
the Merger Consideration then held by the Stockholders Representatives or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, that would otherwise have been payable to
the Stockholders exercising Dissenters Rights.

 

2.8 _No Further Rights of Transfers_. At and after the Effective Time, each
Stockholder and Optionholder shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder
or option holder, as the case may be, of the Company, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law and except for, in the case of a holder of a
certificate representing shares of Common Stock (other than shares of
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_), the right to
surrender such certificate in exchange for payment in accordance with
_Articles II_ and _III_ , and no transfer of shares of Common Stock shall be
made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. Certificates
presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time shall be
canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in this _Article II_. At the close
of business on the day of the Effective Time the stock ledger of the Company
with respect to the shares of Common Stock shall be closed.

2.9 _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate or other instrument that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any of the Common Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate or instrument
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates with respect to such
certificate or instrument, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate or instrument the applicable portion of the Per Share
Price with respect to the Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

forthwith be canceled, and such amount shall be paid into the account which
has been designated by each such Stockholder in such Stockholders Letter of
Transmittal at the times contemplated in _Section 2.7(a)_. Until surrendered

the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall pay the Holdback to the
Stockholders Representatives, to be held by them and distributed in
accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_ and the Letters of Transmittal. 

(f) _Payments in Respect of Debt_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall: (a) pay,
or cause to be paid, to the appropriate creditor the amount required to repay
all Debt as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(f)_ ; and (b) cause all of the
outstanding letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company and the
Subsidiaries to be fully cash collateralized or 

 



17  shall furnish replacement letters of credit or other substitute credit
support arrangements as the beneficiaries of such letters of credit may
reasonably request; _provided_ , that the Company shall, not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, supplement or amend _Schedule
3.1(f)_ with amounts. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall procure and obtain and deliver to Buyer a payoff
letter, in customary form, which payoff letter shall: (i) indicate the total
amount necessary to pay all obligations of the Company and the Subsidiaries
under the Existing Credit Agreement as of the anticipated Closing Date; and
(ii) state that upon receipt of such amount the Existing Credit Agreement and
related instruments evidencing the Existing Credit Agreement shall be
terminated (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") and accompanying Lien releases,
in customary form.

(g) _Deductions_. To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer and the Company shall
treat, and cause their respective Affiliates to treat, the U.S. federal and
state income tax deductions resulting from any option cancellation payments
under _Section 2.7(b)_ and _Section 3.1(d)_ and the payment of Company
Transaction Expenses and any other compensatory payments arising as a result
of the Transactions as accruing on the day after the Closing pursuant to the
"next day" rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any
similar provision of state or local Tax Law.

3.2 _Adjustment to Closing Per Share Price_.

 

(a) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Buyer with a written statement (the " _Estimated
Statement_ ") reflecting the Companys good faith estimate of Closing Cash
(the " _Estimated Cash_ "), a good faith estimate of the Closing Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ ") and a good faith estimate of
the Closing Debt (the " _Estimated Debt_ "), in each case with reasonable
supporting documentation. The determination of Estimated Cash, Estimated
Working Capital and Estimated Debt shall be prepared from the books and
records of the Company and the Subsidiaries. The Estimated Statement shall be
binding on the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, for
purposes of this _Section 3.2(a)_ and shall be used to determine the Closing
Per Share Price.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Stockholders Representatives a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth: (i) Cash as of the close of business on the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date (for Cash denominated in foreign currency, using
the exchange rate determined by Oanda fxTrade on such date) (" _Closing Cash_
") and underlying documentation supporting the Closing Cash; (ii) Net Working
Capital as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (for Net Working Capital in foreign locations, using the exchange
rate determined by Oanda fxTrade on such date) (" _Closing Working Capital_ ")
and underlying documentation supporting the Closing Working Capital; and
(iii) Debt as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Debt_ ") and
underlying documentation supporting the Closing Debt. The determination of
Closing Cash, Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Debt reflected in the
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, from the books
and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in a manner 

 



18  consistent with the past practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries. If
the methodology used for calculating any of the components of Final Working
Capital for purposes of the Closing Statement, or the assumptions, estimates
and/or judgments (so long as such assumptions, estimates and/or judgments are
consistent with GAAP) used in applying such methodology (as determined to be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties in accordance with this _Section
3.2_) vary from the methodology, assumptions, estimates and/or judgments used
for calculating the Net Working Capital Peg (each such varied methodology,
assumption, estimate and judgment, a " _Modified Methodology_ "), then the
Net Working Capital Peg shall be recalculated to take into account such
positive or negative variance for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price
Adjustment, if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that the assumptions, estimates
and/or judgments used in applying the methodology used for calculating any of
the components of Final Working Capital may be modified in the event the
underlying facts and circumstances change between the date hereof and
the Closing Date, and in such instance the Net Working Capital Peg shall not
be recalculated. The use of a Modified Methodology as described in the
immediately preceding sentence is referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Modification Event_."

(c) During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of the Closing
Statement to the Stockholders Representatives, the Stockholders
Representatives and their advisors shall have the right, upon reasonable
notice to the Company, to reasonable access to the Companys books and records
and the Companys Director of Treasury Management, in each case as the
Stockholders Representatives shall reasonably request in order to review the
Closing Statement. The Closing Statement (and the computation of Closing Cash,
Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt) delivered by Buyer to the
Stockholders Representatives shall be conclusive and binding on all parties
unless the Stockholders Representatives, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Buyer stating that the
Stockholders Representatives disagree with such calculation and specifying in
reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which the Stockholders
Representatives disagree and the basis therefor. The Stockholders
Representatives shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement and not disagreed with pursuant to
_Section 3.2(b)_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in the event
of a Modification Event, the Net Working Capital Peg shall be recalculated
taking into account each Modified Methodology.

 

(d) If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered pursuant to _Section
3.2(c)_, the Stockholders Representatives and Buyer shall, during the
fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Cash, Closing Working
Capital and Closing Debt, as applicable. If during such period, the
Stockholders Representatives and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement,
they shall promptly thereafter cause KPMG or such other independent accounting
firm on which the Stockholders Representatives and Buyer mutually agree, as
the case may be, in each case other than the New York, Boston or Cleveland
office thereof (the " _Independent Accountant_ "), to review this Agreement
and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing
Cash, Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt, as applicable (it being
understood that in making such calculation, the

 



19  Independent Accountant shall be functioning as an expert and not as an
arbitrator). Buyer and each of the Stockholders Representatives agree that it
shall not engage, or agree to engage the Independent Accountant to perform
any new services other than as the Independent Accountant pursuant hereto
until the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Cash, Closing
Working Capital and Closing Debt, as applicable, have been finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 3.2_. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by
the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter. Buyer and the
Stockholders Representatives shall cooperate with the Independent Accountant
and promptly provide all documents and information requested by the
Independent Accountant. In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant
shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement, and
the Stockholders Representatives calculation of Closing Cash, Closing
Working Capital or Closing Debt, as the case may be, as to which the
Stockholders Representatives have disagreed in their notice of disagreement
duly delivered pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_. The Independent Accountants
determination on each item in dispute shall not be greater than the greater
value for such item claimed by either the Stockholders Representatives or
Buyer or less than the lower value for such item claimed by either the
Stockholders Representatives or Buyer. The Stockholders Representatives and
Buyer shall direct the Independent Accountant to deliver to the Stockholders
Representatives and Buyer, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no
later than thirty (30) days from the date of its engagement), a report setting
forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon
Stockholders Representatives and Buyer, and neither Buyer nor the
Stockholders Representatives shall seek further recourse to courts or other
tribunals, other than to enforce such report. The Independent Accountant will
determine the allocation of the cost of its review and report based on the
inverse of the percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to
the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to
Independent Accountant. For example, should the items in dispute total in
amount to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of the
Stockholders Representatives position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of
its review would be borne by Buyer and forty percent (40%) of the costs would
be borne by the Stockholders and Optionholders.

(e) The " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ " will equal the sum of the Final
Cash Adjustment, _plus_ the Final Working Capital Adjustment, _minus_ the
Final Debt Adjustment. If the Purchase Price Adjustment is a positive number:
(i) Buyer shall pay to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of each Stockholder, and
to the Surviving Corporation for payment to the Optionholders, a Pro Rata
Share of the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment as an
adjustment to the dollar amount of the aggregate Closing Per Share Price and
Closing Option Price, subject in the case of payments from the Surviving
Corporation to the Optionholders, to applicable Tax withholdings; and (ii) the
Stockholders Representatives shall pay to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of
the Stockholders, and to the Surviving Corporation for payment to the
Optionholders, the Holdback (to be divided among them in accordance with the
Stockholders and the Optionholders respective Pro Rata Shares). If the
Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative number, the Stockholders
Representatives shall cause to be paid to Buyer in the manner provided in
_Section 3.2(f)_ the amount equal to the absolute value of the Purchase Price
Adjustment and shall pay to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of
the Stockholders, and to the Surviving Corporation for payment to the
Optionholders, any remainder of the

 



20  Holdback after payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment to Buyer (to be
divided between them in accordance with the Stockholders and the
Optionholders respective Pro Rata Shares), subject in the case of payments
from the Surviving Corporation to the Optionholders, to applicable Tax
withholdings. To the extent the parties are in agreement that an amount should
be paid either to (i) Buyer or (ii) the Stockholders and Optionholders, and
any dispute to be resolved under _Section 3.2(d)_ relates only to the quantum
of such amount, the amount not in dispute (being the lower of the amount
proposed by Buyer and the amount proposed by the
Stockholders Representatives) shall be paid promptly to the appropriate
party and any subsequent amount paid in accordance with the final
determination by the Independent Accountant of such amount and any remaining
disputed items.

 

(f) Any payment pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within five (5) Business Days after Final Cash,
Final Working Capital and Final Debt has been determined by wire transfer by
Buyer or the Stockholders Representatives, as the case may be, of immediately
available funds to the account of such other party as may be designated in
writing by such other party. All payments under this _Section 3.2_ shall be
without interest, except that any amounts not paid when required by this
_Section 3.2_ shall bear interest from the date due pursuant to this
_Section 3.2(f)_ to, and including, the date of payment at the Interest Rate.

3.3  _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld,
from any payment made pursuant to _Articles II_ and _III_ , such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to
the appropriate Governmental Body, such deducted and withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Delaware pursuant to the DGCL; and (iii) such other consents, waivers,

(b) _Schedule 4.10(b)_ sets forth a complete list of all real property
owned by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (" _Owned Real Property_ "

a Subsidiary owns good and valid title in fee simple to the Owned Real
Property, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Exceptions.

 



25 (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect:

(i) the Owned Real Property and the real property held under a Real Property
Lease located at 68 New Hampshire Avenue, Pease International Tradeport,
Portsmouth, New Hampshire (the " _Portsmouth Property_ "), is licensed,
permitted and authorized for the purposes for which they are currently being
used and can be used by the Company or applicable Subsidiary after the
Closing for such uses without violating any Law or private restriction. There
are no proceedings or amendments pending and brought by or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened by any third party which would result in a change
in the allowable uses of the Owned Real Property or the Portsmouth Property or
which would modify the right of the Company or applicable Subsidiary to use
the Owned Real Property or the Portsmouth Property for its current uses
immediately after Closing;

(ii) the Company has not received (A) any notice from any Governmental Body

rights-of-way, covenants, conditions, restrictions, licenses, reservations or
other charges or encumbrances or defects or imperfections of title on or
affecting any part of the Realty, other than the Permitted Exceptions. 

4.11 _Tangible Personal Property_. _Schedule 4.11_ sets forth all leases of
personal property by the Company or a Subsidiary (" _Personal Property
Leases_ ") involving annual payments in excess of $150,000. To the Knowledge
of the Company, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received
any written notice of any default or any event that with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default, by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries under any of the Personal Property Leases. The Company and the
Subsidiaries own good title to, hold pursuant to valid leases or otherwise
have the valid and legal right to use, all of their material tangible personal
property shown to be owned by them on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the Subsidiaries as at the Balance Sheet Date (except for
such personal property sold or disposed of subsequent to the date thereof in
the Ordinary Course of Business), free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Exceptions.

 



26 4.12 _Intellectual Property_. _Schedule 4.12_ contains a list of all
the material registered Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries and used in the Ordinary Course of Business. The Company and
the Subsidiaries own or have valid licenses to use all Intellectual Property
used by them in the Ordinary Course of Business, except to the extent the
failure to be the owner or the valid licensee would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and any
such Intellectual Property is valid, in effect and subsisting. All material
Intellectual Property used in the Ordinary Course of Business that is
registered in the United States is free and clear of all Liens (except for
Permitted Exceptions and those Liens under the Existing Credit Agreement,
provided that such Liens shall cease to have effect as of the Closing Date).
To the Knowledge of the Company, all material Intellectual Property used in
the Ordinary Course of Business that is registered other than in the United
States is free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Exceptions and
those Liens under the Existing Credit Agreement, provided that such Liens
shall cease to have effect as of the Closing Date). To the Knowledge of the
Company: (a) the material Intellectual Property listed on _Schedule 4.12_ is
not the subject of any written challenge received by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries in writing; and (b) neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any default or any event that
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under any
material license of Intellectual Property to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect: (i) the conduct of the business as currently conducted by the
Company and the Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise
violate any Persons Intellectual Property, and there is no such claim pending
or threatened in writing against the Company or any Subsidiary; and (ii) to
the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing or otherwise violating
any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any Subsidiary and no such
claim is pending or threatened in writing against any person by the Company or
any Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no
misappropriation of any material trade secrets or material confidential
Intellectual Property used in the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries
by any third Person.

employee, retired employee or terminated employee of the Company or any

or commitment to create any additional Company Benefit Plan or modify or
change any existing Company Benefit Plan or terminate any established employee
benefit practice (except, in each case, as required by applicable Law) in a
way that would materially affect any group of employees, retired employees or
terminated employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to the Company, nor has any
intention to do any of the foregoing been communicated in writing to any such
group of employees, retired employees or terminated employees. The Company has

reasonably practicable after the date hereof, correct and complete copies of:
(i) each Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any such Company Benefit

Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required); (iii) the most recent

and applicable Laws, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability to the Company. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened claims by or on behalf of any of the Company
Benefit Plans, by any employee or beneficiary under any such Company Benefit
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), except as would not reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to the Company.

(b) No Company Benefit Plan based in the United Kingdom is subject to Part 3
of the Pensions Act of 2004 or Section 75 of the Pensions Act of 1995. All
Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be tax qualified under Section

Pension Plan_ ") and each has been timely amended to comply with applicable
Law, and received or applied for a favorable determination or opinion letter
in a time frame that is consistent with the Company Pension Plan cycle for
filing with the IRS. To the Knowledge of the Company no event has occurred
since the date of the most recent determination or opinion letter or
application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such Company
Pension Plan. The Company has made available to Buyer, or will make available
to Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, a correct
and complete copy of the most recent determination or opinion letter received
with respect to each Company Pension Plan, as well as a correct and complete
copy of each pending application for a determination letter, if any.

 



31 (c) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of the
date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have
been made or have been reflected on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the Subsidiaries as at the Balance Sheet Date. No Company
Pension Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined

life insurance or medical, dental or vision benefits (whether or not
insured), with respect to current or former employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary following their retirement or other termination of service.

the consummation of the Transactions will not, in any respect: (i) entitle any

payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation due any such
director, officer or employee.

 

(f) The Company has not been a party to a non-exempt prohibited transaction

connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any Company
Benefit Plan under ERISA. No action, suit, proceeding, hearing or
investigation with respect to the administration or investment of the assets
of any Company Benefit Plan is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened. No material audit, inquiry or procedure for which the Company has
received written notice is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened by the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of Labor or other
Governmental Body with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

contract or arrangement that would reasonably be expected to result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or in the payment of
any nonqualified deferred compensation subject to any material additional tax
under Section 409A of the Code. No holder of Options is entitled to any gross-
up payment with respect to any such "excess parachute payments."

(h) The Company has properly classified all individuals who perform services
for it under the Company Benefit Plans, and to the extent applicable ERISA and
the Code, as common law employees, independent contractors or leased
employees.

payment from Buyer or Merger Sub in respect thereof.

5.6 _Sufficient Funds_.

 

(a) _Schedule 5.6(a)_ sets forth true and correct copies of an executed
commitment letter from Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
UBS Loan Finance LLC and UBS Securities LLC and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman
Islands Branch dated as of the date hereof (the " _Financing Commitment
Letter_ " and the commitments thereunder, the " _Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the
lenders party thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to
Buyer for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Financing_ ").

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letter is
in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto.
There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the
Financing Commitments that could affect the availability of the Financing or
the timing of the Closing. No event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Buyer under any term or condition of the Financing Commitment Letter,
and, assuming the closing conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ and _(b)_
have been satisfied and compliance in all material respects by the Company
with _Section 6.10_, Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of closing to be satisfied
by it, contained in the Financing Commitment Letter. Buyer has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to
be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the closing
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ and  _(b)_ have been satisfied and
compliance in all material respects by the Company with _Section 6.10_, the
aggregate proceeds from the Financing, together with cash and borrowings under
Buyers existing credit facilities, are sufficient for satisfaction of all of
Buyers obligations under this Agreement in an amount

 



39  sufficient to consummate the Transactions, including the payment of the
Merger Consideration and the payment of all associated costs and expenses
(including without limitation the Company Transaction Expenses and any
required refinancing of indebtedness of Buyer, the " _Required Amount_ "). The
Financing Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to
Buyer on the terms set forth therein. As of the date of this Agreement, none
of the Financing Commitments has been withdrawn and Buyer does not know of any
facts or circumstances that may be expected to result in any of
the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter not being
satisfied. To the extent this Agreement must be in a form acceptable to any
lender providing Financing, such lender or lenders have approved this
Agreement.

 

(c) Buyers obligations under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding Buyers, its Affiliates, or any other Persons ability to obtain
financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.7  _Solvency_.

(a) Immediately after giving effect to the Merger and the consummation of the
other Transactions, including the payment of the Closing Per Share Price
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ (including any adjustments thereto pursuant to
_Section 3.2(a)_) and payment of all related fees and expenses:

 

(i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
assets of Buyer and the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall
be greater than the total amount, taken as a whole, required to pay their
liabilities (including all liabilities, whether or not reflected in a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether direct or indirect, fixed
or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed);

(ii) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, shall be able to pay their debts and obligations in the Ordinary Course
of Business as they become due; and

(iii) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, shall not have unreasonably small capital for the operation of the
businesses in which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged thereafter.

(b) In completing the Transactions, Buyer does not intend to hinder, delay or
defraud any present or future creditors of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
or the Subsidiaries.

5.8 _Merger Sub s Operations_. Buyer owns beneficially and of record all of
the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and has not engaged in any
business activities or conducted any operations other than in connection with
such Transactions.

 



40 5.9 _Knowledge of Buyer_. To the Knowledge of Buyer, except as expressly set
forth in the Schedules, there exists no basis for any action, suit,
proceeding or claim of any nature (including for breach of contract or in
tort), whether at law or in equity, that may be asserted by Buyer or Merger
Sub, or by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, against the Stockholders,
their Affiliates (not including any portfolio company), and each of their
current and former partners and other employees that have been engaged in the
provision of services to the Company and/or the Subsidiaries under the
Management Agreement or otherwise in connection with the operation or
management of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries.

6.3 _Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Each of the parties agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, Permits or Orders from all Governmental Bodies. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees
(i) to make or cause to be made an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after
the date hereof and to request and use reasonable best efforts to obtain early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) to make, or cause to
be made, all filings required of each of them or any of their respective
subsidiaries or Affiliates under the other Antitrust Laws as described on
_Schedule 4.3(b)_ as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days) after the date hereof; and (iii) to supply as promptly as
reasonably

 



43  practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or the other Antitrust Laws.

 

(b) Further, and without limiting the generality of the rest of this _Section
6.4_, each of the parties shall cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry and shall promptly (i) furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other parties may
request in connection with the foregoing, (ii) inform the other of any
communication from any Governmental Body regarding any of the Transactions,
and (iii) provide counsel for the other parties with copies of all filings
made by such party, and all correspondence between such party (and its
advisors) with any Governmental Body and any other information supplied by
such party and such partys subsidiaries to a Governmental Body or received
from such a Governmental Body in connection with the Transactions; _provided_
, _however_ , that materials may be redacted as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and with applicable Law. Each party hereto shall,
subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for the other parties to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Body
in connection with the Transactions. To the extent practicable and, in their
good faith determination, reasonable under the circumstances, the parties
shall provide each other advance notice and the opportunity to attend and
participate prior to any participation in any meaningful meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Body in
connection with the Transactions.

(c) Further, and without limiting the generality of the rest of this _Section
6.4_, Buyer and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law or other Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Body or private party with respect to
this Agreement so as to make effective as promptly as practicable the
Transactions and to avoid any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Termination Date.
The steps involved in the preceding sentence shall include, without
limitation, (i) defending through litigation on the merits, including appeals,
any claim asserted in any court or other proceeding by any party; or (ii)
agreeing to take any other action as may be required by a Governmental Body in
order (A) to obtain all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations as
soon as reasonably possible, and in any event before the Termination
Date, (B) to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, dissolved,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect in any Legal
Proceeding and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transactions, or (C) to effect the expiration or termination of any waiting
period, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
Closing beyond the Termination Date. At the request of Buyer, the Company
shall agree to take any action with respect to the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries in the two preceding sentences, provided that any such action is
conditioned upon (and shall not be completed prior to) the consummation of
the Transactions. Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of Affiliates not to,
take any action which is intended to or which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the ability of any of the parties hereto from obtaining
(or cause delay in

 



44  obtaining) any necessary approvals of any Governmental Body required for the
Transactions, from performing its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement, or from consummating the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall be under no obligation to sell, divest, license or
dispose of any assets or businesses of Buyer (or its Affiliates) or the
Company or the Subsidiaries or to enter into any agreement to take or commit
to take actions that limit Buyers or its Affiliates freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the business, product lines or
assets of Buyer (or its Affiliates), the Company or the Subsidiaries.
Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_ so long as such
party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under
this _Section 6.3_; _provided_ , that such party is otherwise entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_,
as applicable.

 

6.4 _Further Assurances_. Subject to, and not in limitation of, _Section
6.4_, each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company shall use (and the Company
shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to
(i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transactions
and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate and make effective
the Transactions.

6.5  _Confidentiality_. Each of Buyer and Merger acknowledges that the
information provided to them in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions is subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between
TransDigm Group Incorporated and the Company dated December 28, 2011 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. 

6.6 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Persons who on or prior
to the Closing Date were directors, managing members or officers of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with
respect to all acts or omissions by them to the extent arising from or
relating to any such Indemnitees duties as an officer, director or managing
member of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. Buyer agrees that all rights
of the Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, or comparable organizational
documents of the any of the Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended,
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay any expenses
of any Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_, as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such 

 



45  advances to the extent required by applicable Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws or any indemnification agreement then in effect
between such person and the Company.

 

(b) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that certain Indemnitees
may have rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
provided by Berkshire Partners LLC or Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the " _Indemnitors_ "). Buyer hereby agrees: (i) that it is
the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the Indemnitees with
respect to claims arising from or relating to their service as officers,
directors or managing members of the Company or the Subsidiaries (as opposed
to claims relating to their roles with Berkshire Partners LLC or Greenbriar
Equity Group LLC or their respective Affiliates) are primary and any
obligation of the Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the
Indemnitees are secondary); (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by any Indemnitee for such claims and shall be
liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and
amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by
the terms of this Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, and
certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws,
limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement or
comparable organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries (or any other
agreement between the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and any such
Indemnitee), without regard to any rights the Indemnitee may have against the
Indemnitors; and (iii) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases
the Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Indemnitors for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. Buyer further agrees that no advancement or payment by the
Indemnitors on behalf of Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which an
Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the
foregoing and the Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be
subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the Indemnitee against the Company. Buyer and the Indemnitees
agree that the Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms
of this _Section 6.6(b)_.

(c) Buyer, from and after the Closing Date, shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause: (i) the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of certain liabilities
of directors, officers and managing members than are set forth as of the date
of this Agreement in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws; and (ii)
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable organizational
documents of each Subsidiary to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of certain liabilities of directors,
officers and managing members that are set forth as of the date of this
agreement in such certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents, which provisions in each case shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitee.

 



46 (d) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall, at its own expense, obtain a six
(6) year "run-off" or "tail" policy for the Company and the Subsidiaries, and
maintain such policy in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date, with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events
that occurred at or before the Closing Date, with reputable and financially
sound carriers and with at least the same coverage and amounts as and
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous than the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Subsidiaries and Buyer shall provide evidence of such "run-
off" or "tail" policy to the Stockholders Representatives prior to the
Closing Date and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries
to maintain such policy in effect for the full period of six (6) years after
the Closing Date.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract disclosed in _Schedule 4.13_ or otherwise.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 

(g) The obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
6.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies without the consent
of the affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.6_).

6.7 _Publicity_. Prior to the Closing, none of the Company, Buyer or Merger
Sub shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning this
Agreement or the Transactions without obtaining the prior written approval of
the other parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub, as
applicable, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which the Company or Buyer lists
securities; _provided_  that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the
party intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other party
with respect to the timing and content thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Stockholders are permitted to report and disclose the status of the
Agreement and the Transactions to their limited partners in the ordinary
course of their business.

 

6.8 _Conduct of Buyer Prior to the Closing_. During the period commencing on
the date of this Agreement and terminating on the earlier to occur of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance
with _Article VIII_ , Buyer shall not take, or cause to be taken, any action
which would interfere with the 

 



47  consummation of the Transactions or delay the consummation of the
Transactions. Prior to the Closing, other than communications in the ordinary
course of Buyers business in compliance with Buyers confidentiality
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer and its representatives
shall contact and communicate with the customers, suppliers and lessors of the
Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby only with the prior written consent of the Company.

6.9 _Employee Benefits_. For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Buyer providing benefits
to Continuing Employees (the " _Buyer Plans_ "), Buyer shall credit each
Continuing Employee with his or her years of services with the Company, the
Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit
for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. The Buyer Plans
shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing
conditions and shall credit such Continuing Employees for any deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses paid in the year of initial participation in the Buyer
Plan. 

6.10 _Financing Activities_.

(a) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the
Stockholders Representatives, the Company and their respective Affiliates
have no responsibility for any financing that Buyer or Merger Sub may raise
in connection with the Transactions.

(b) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Financing and the Financing
Commitment Letter, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements
with respect to the Financing, so that such agreements are in effect as
promptly as practicable but in any event no later than the Closing Date, (iii)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iv) enforce its
rights under the Financing Commitment Letter. Buyer shall provide to the
Company copies of all documents relating to the Financing and shall keep the
Company reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the
financing process relating thereto. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not
agree to, or permit, any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the
Financing Commitment Letter or other documentation relating to the Financing
which would reasonably be expected to adversely effect Buyer or Merger Subs
ability to consummate the Transactions without the prior written consent of
the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Financing Commitment Letter may be amended, modified, supplemented,
restated or superseded at the option of Buyer after the date hereof but prior
to the Closing (a " _New Financing Commitment_ "); provided that the terms of
any New Financing Commitment shall not (1) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing, (2) expand upon (or alter in any manner adverse to the
interests of the Company) the conditions precedent to the Financing as set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letter, or (3) reasonably be expected to
delay the Closing. In such event, the definitions of "Financing Commitment
Letter," "Financing Commitments" and "Financing" contained herein shall be
deemed to include any

 



48  Financing Commitments or documents related thereto not so amended, modified,
supplemented, restated or superseded, together with the New Financing
Commitment. Further, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing (or any
alternative financing) has not been obtained, Buyer and Merger Sub shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Transactions subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1_ and to
Buyers termination rights under _Article VIII_ , if applicable.

(c) If, notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable efforts by Buyer
to satisfy its obligations under _Section 6.10(b)_, any of the Financing or
the Financing Commitments (or any definitive financing agreement relating
thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part,
for any reason, Buyer shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration
or termination and the reasons therefor and (ii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts promptly to arrange for alternative financing ("
_Replacement Financing_ ") (which shall be sufficient to pay the Required
Amount from other sources and which do not, without the prior consent of the
Company, include any conditions of such alternative financing that are more
onerous than or in addition to the conditions set forth in the Financing) to
replace the financing contemplated by such expired or terminated commitments
or arrangements.

 

(d) The Company shall provide to Buyer all cooperation that is reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with the Financing, including the following:
(i) causing the Companys senior officers to participate in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, sessions with rating agencies or other
customary syndication activities; (ii) assisting with the preparation
of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda and similar documents reasonably required in connection
with the Financing; (iii) assisting with the preparation of any pledge and
security documents, any loan agreement, currency or interest hedging
agreement and other definitive financing documents on terms satisfactory to
Buyer, provided that no obligation of the Company or the Subsidiaries under
any such document or agreement shall be effective until the Effective Time;
(iv) facilitating the pledging of collateral, provided that no pledge shall be
effective until the Effective Time; (v) furnishing on a confidential basis to
Buyer and the Financing Sources as promptly as practicable, such financial
information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer, including the financial statements required by paragraph 3
of Exhibit B to the Financing Commitment Letter; (vi) requesting that the
administrative agent and collateral agent under the Existing Credit Agreement
provide the Payoff Letter and related ancillary agreements; (vii) providing
requested officers certificates and representation letters to the extent
required by the terms of the Financing Commitment Letter; (viii) using
commercially reasonably efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts of the
Financing Sources benefit from the existing lending relationships of
the Company and the Subsidiaries; (ix) causing the taking of corporate and
other actions by the Company and the Subsidiaries to permit completion of the
Financing; (x) facilitating the execution and delivery (at the Closing) of
definitive documents required by the terms of the Financing Commitment Letter
related to the Financing; and (xi) causing to be prepared and rendered
requested opinions of counsel, in each of the foregoing cases as may be
necessary and customary in connection with a financing substantially similar
to the Financing; provided that, notwithstanding anything

 



49  in this Agreement to the contrary, until the Effective Time occurs neither
the Company or the Subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee, (2) have any liability or obligation under any other
agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document related
to the Financing, or (3) be required to incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments.
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless, the Company and the Subsidiaries, and
their respective officers, employees and representatives, from and against any
and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith, except in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of or
result from the willful misconduct of the Company or the
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph, such requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company or the Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall promptly
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
it in connection with such cooperation.

6.11 _Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules_. The Company may, at its
option, include in the Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid
any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such
items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms or any other terms defined in _Article I_
(and, in particular, the inclusion of any item in the Schedules shall not, in
and of itself, be a basis for taking such item into account in determining
Debt or Net Working Capital or whether there has been a Material Adverse
Effect). From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the
right to supplement or amend the Schedules with respect to any matter
hereafter arising or discovered after the date hereof. No such supplement or
amendment shall have any effect on the satisfaction of the condition to
closing set forth in  _Section 7.1(a)_.

6.12 Holdback. Until such time as the Stockholders Representatives shall
remit the Holdback to the appropriate parties in accordance with Section
3.2(e), the Stockholders Representatives will hold the Holdback, or cause the
Holdback to be held by a third party, segregated from the general assets of
the Stockholders Representatives and will invest the Holdback only in direct
obligations of the United States of America, or any agency thereof, the
obligations of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or money-market investments that invest in such
obligations. Nothing herein shall limit the obligations hereunder of the
Stockholders Representatives to pay any Purchase Price Adjustment to the
amount of the Holdback.

 

6.13 _280G_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall solicit from each "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G of the Code) a waiver of such individuals right to
receive payments to the extent required to avoid the incidence of any "excess
parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). Thereafter,
prior to the Closing Date, the Company will submit to a shareholder vote, in a
manner intended to satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section
280G of the Code, the right of each disqualified individual to

 



50  receive or retain any and all "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the
Code that had been waived.

6.14 _Financial Statements_. If the Closing shall not have occurred and this
Agreement shall not have been terminated by the close of business on April 30,
2012, the Company shall use its best efforts to deliver on the next Business
Day to Buyer copies of the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2011 and the related audited
consolidated statements of income and of cash flows of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for the year then ended.

Buyer or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, in each of cases (i) and
(ii), as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except
to the extent that any such representation or warranty, by its terms, is

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

 

8.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

 

(a) At the election of the Company or Buyer on or after April 20, 2012 (the "
_Termination Date_ ") if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of
business on such date; _provided_ that (i) if the Company is the terminating
party, it is not in breach in any material respect of any of its obligations
hereunder and (ii) if Buyer is the terminating party, neither Buyer nor
Merger Sub is in breach in any material respect of any of its obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that if all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ have been satisfied as of the Termination Date (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing), then Buyer shall not be permitted to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that each
of the Company and Buyer shall have the right to extend, from time to time,
the Termination Date for additional periods of time not to exceed sixty (60)
days in the aggregate if all conditions to the Closing (other than the
conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(d)_ and _7.2(d)_ ) are satisfied or
capable of then being satisfied and the party exercising such right reasonably
believes that such conditions will be satisfied on or prior to the
Termination Date, as extended);

(b) by mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer;

 



53 (c) by either the Company or Buyer if there shall have been a breach by the
other party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.1(a)_ and _7.1(b)_ (in the case of a breach by the Company), or _Sections
7.2(a)_ and _7.2(b)_ (in the case of a breach by Buyer or Merger Sub), and in
any such case such breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the Termination Date;

(d) by the Company or Buyer if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable
Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions; it being agreed
that subject to _Section 6.3(b)_ hereof, the parties hereto shall promptly
appeal any adverse determination which is not nonappealable (and pursue such
appeal with reasonable diligence); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available
to a party if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

(e) by Buyer if a copy of the Stockholder Approval shall not have been
delivered to Buyer (by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission,
such as by electronic mail in ".pdf" form) by 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the
date hereof.

 

8.2 _Procedure upon Termination_. In the event of termination and abandonment
by Buyer or the Company, or both, pursuant to  _Section 8.1_ hereof, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties, and

without further action by Buyer or the Company.

 

8.3 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.1_ and _8.2_ , then the parties hereto shall be relieved of their
duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such
termination and such termination shall be without liability to Buyer, Merger
Sub, the Company or the Stockholders Representatives; _provided_ , that (i)
no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement, and (ii) the obligations of the parties set
forth in _Article IX_ hereof shall survive any such termination and shall be
enforceable hereunder.

 

(b) Nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall relieve the parties hereto of any
liability for a breach of any of its covenants or agreements or willful
breach of its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement prior
to the date of termination. The damages recoverable by the non-breaching party
shall include all attorneys fees reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with the Transactions.

(c) The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall relieve the parties hereto
of their obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



54 ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 _Survival_. None of the representations and warranties of any party
contained in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents
(including any certificate to be delivered under _Article VII_ of this
Agreement), other than the representations and warranties set forth in 
_Section 5.9_, shall survive the Closing. None of the covenants of any party
required to be performed by such party before the Closing shall survive the
Closing. Unless otherwise indicated, the covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement which by their terms are required to be performed after the
Closing shall survive the Closing until they have been performed or satisfied.

9.2 _Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer,
intangible, recordation, documentary, stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of
any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the Transactions
shall be borne by Buyer; _provided_ , that any state transfer Tax applicable
to, or resulting from the transfer of Common Stock in the Merger, and imposed
on a Stockholder shall be borne by the applicable Stockholder. 

9.3 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party to this Agreement will bear
its respective fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or the
Transactions (including legal, accounting and other professional fees), and
the Company will bear the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Stockholders in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer
will pay and be solely responsible for Transaction related fees and expenses
of Buyer, Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates, any "run-off" or
"tail" policy purchased by Buyer pursuant _Section 6.7(g)_, all filing fees
payable under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws and all fees and
expenses related to financing transactions incurred in connection with the
Closing. If any party obtains an injunction, a decree or order of specific
performance or other remedy, the other party (other than an Affiliate of such
party) shall reimburse such party for all out-of-pocket expenses (including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and
consultants) incurred by or on behalf of such party or any Affiliate of such
party in connection with obtaining such injunction, a decree or order of
specific performance or other remedy.

9.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State. 

 



55 (b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in any such
action or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties to
this Agreement agrees that it will not bring any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing Commitments (or any commitment letter
relating to any Replacement Financing or any New Financing Commitment) or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America, in each case, sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court thereof. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of
a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.7_.

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights to
trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions (including the Financing or any Replacement
Financing and the obligations of the Financing Sources in respect thereof).

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto), the Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, and each
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby or
to be executed in connection with the Transactions, represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior agreements among
the parties respecting the Transactions. The parties hereto have voluntarily
agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the
Transactions exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, and the parties
hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any
remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents. The sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or
related to the Transactions shall be those remedies available at law or in
equity for breach of contract against the parties to this Agreement only (as
such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to
the express terms of this Agreement), and the parties hereby agree that
neither party hereto shall have any remedies or causes of action (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) for any statements, communications, disclosures,
failures to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth in this
Agreement.

 



56 9.6 _Amendments and Waivers._ This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought; _provided_ , that the consent of the Financing Sources (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall be required
for any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of _Sections 9.4(b)_ ,
_9.4(d)_ , _9.6_ or  _9.9_ or the definition of "Financing Sources" set forth
in _Section 1.1_, in each case, in a manner adversely affecting the rights of
the Financing Sources. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including
any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

9.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand
(with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile (with
written confirmation of transmission), (iii) when received or rejected by the
addressee if sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return

9.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. 

9.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns and
nothing herein expressed or implied will give or be construed to give any
Person, other than the parties and such permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable rights hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties
hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) the provisions of 
_Section 6.6_ hereof are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, all current or former directors, officers, employees, agents
or stockholders of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (in all of their
capacities) affected thereby; (ii) the provisions of _Section 9.13_ hereof
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, any past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any of the
Stockholders, Optionholders, the Stockholders Representatives or the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates affected thereby; (iii) this Agreement
is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable in all
respects by, the Stockholders and the Stockholders Representatives; and (iv)
the provisions of _Section 9.4_ and _Section 9.6_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable in all respects by, each Financing
Source and its successors and permitted assigns. No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party
hereto, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted
assignment without the required consents shall be void. No assignment of any
obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any
such obligations.

 



59 9.10 _Legal Representation_. Buyer hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (all such parties, the "
_Waiving Parties_ "), that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP (the " _Retained Firm_
") may represent any or all of the Stockholders and Optionholders in the event
such Person so requests, in each case in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, including under _Section 3.2_ (any such representation, the
" _Post-Closing Representation_ "), and Buyer on behalf of itself and the
Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will
not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising from the fact
that the Retained Firm previously represented the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries (but nothing herein shall require the Waiving Parties to consent
to the representation of the Stockholders and Optionholders by the Retained
Firm if the Retained Firms conflict arises out of any matter other than the
representation of the Company or Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time).
Each of Buyer and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the
Stockholders, Optionholders and any of their Affiliates (the " _Seller Group_
") and their counsel, including the Retained Firm, made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or
any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the Transactions, or any matter
relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged communications between the
Seller Group and such counsel. From and after the Closing, each of Buyer and
the Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not
assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between the Retained Firm and the Company or any Person in the Seller Group
occurring during the representation in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation of the Transactions in
connection with any Post-Closing Representation.

9.11 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. Each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges that this Agreement
embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement specifically
acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with another party that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary purchaser and an
ordinary seller in an arms length transaction.

 

9.12 _Non-Recourse._ No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any of the Stockholders, Optionholders, the Stockholders
Representatives or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the
Stockholders, Optionholders, the Stockholders Representatives or the Company
under this Agreement or for any claim (whether in contract or tort, in law or
in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to "pierce the corporate veil"
or impose liability of an entity against its owners or Affiliates or
otherwise), liability or any other obligation arising under, based on, in
respect of, in

 



60  connection with, or by reason of, the Transactions or this Agreement,
including its negotiation and/or execution.

9.13 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.3_, each party shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement by any other party and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of any other party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and
appropriate injunctive relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any
party seeking an injunction, a decree or order of specific performance or
other equitable remedy shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be in addition and
not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law or in equity. If any party brings any action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
party bringing such action may unilaterally extend the Termination Date
(notwithstanding the termination provisions of _Section 8.1(a)_, so long as
the party bringing such action is actively seeking a court order for an
injunction or injunctions or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
of this Agreement.

(b) In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of Buyers obligation to fund the Merger and to consummate the
Merger in the event that all conditions in _Section 7.1_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing).

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action
for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.14 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts including by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission,
such as by electronic mail in ".pdf" form, each of which will be deemed to be
an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will
be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.
