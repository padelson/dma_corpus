                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

         This Agreement and Plan of Reorganization ("Agreement") is made and
entered into as of the 29th day of June, 2005, by and between MAF Bancorp, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"), and EFC Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - -

         WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the Company deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders that the
Company be merged with and into Purchaser in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, immediately following the merger of the Company with and into
Purchaser (the "Merger"), Purchaser and the Company intend that EFS Bank, an
Illinois state-chartered savings bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (the "Bank"), shall merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into Mid America
Bank, fsb, a federal savings bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser
("Mid America"); and

         WHEREAS, Purchaser and the Company intend the Merger to qualify as a
tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended ("Code").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                       I.

                                   THE MERGER

         1.1 Effects of the Merger. (a) Surviving Corporation. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the separate existence of the Company
shall cease and the Company shall be merged with and into Purchaser at the
Effective Time (as defined below) in accordance with the DGCL, with Purchaser
being the continuing and surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

         (b) Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of
Purchaser shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and the DGCL.

         (c) By-laws. The By-laws of Purchaser in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
altered, amended or repealed as provided therein, or in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the DGCL.

         (d) Directors and Officers. The directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the persons who were directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time, plus the current member of the Company's Board of Directors
appointed to Purchaser's Board of


<PAGE>

Directors pursuant to Section 5.15. The officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the persons who were officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

         1.2 Conversion of Shares upon the Merger. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of Purchaser Common Stock (as defined below) or Company
Common Stock (as defined below), the following shall occur:

         (a) Purchaser Common Stock. Each share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Purchaser ("Purchaser Common Stock") issued and outstanding
or held in treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding or treasury shares of Purchaser Common Stock and shall be
unchanged following the Merger.

         (b) Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 1.2(c), Section 1.2(d) and
Section 1.6(c), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as defined and pursuant to Section 1.5.

         (c) Company Common Stock Held by the Company or Purchaser. All shares
of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock held directly
or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties) that are
(i) owned by the Company as treasury stock, (ii) owned directly or indirectly by
the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or (iii) owned directly or
indirectly by Purchaser or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, shall be
cancelled and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefore.

         (d) Dissenting Shares. Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock
the holder of which has perfected appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such rights as of the Effective Time
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. The Company shall give
Purchaser prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any such demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock and of
withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to
applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called
a "Dissenting Stockholder"), and Purchaser shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Stockholder
as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation.

         1.3 Stock Options. (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by
the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each an "Option," and
collectively, "Options"),


                                      - 2 -
<PAGE>

which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall, at the option of the holder of such Option, be converted pursuant to
either Section 1.3(a)(i) or (ii) below:

                  (i) each Option held by a holder of an Option who, prior to
         the Effective Time, delivers a conversion agreement in the form of
         Exhibit A-1 attached hereto ("Conversion Agreement") shall be converted
         into an option to purchase shares of Purchaser Common Stock in such
         number and at such exercise price as set forth herein and otherwise
         having the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to
         the Effective Time (except to the extent that such terms, conditions
         and restrictions may be altered in accordance with their terms as a
         result of the Merger contemplated hereby, and except that any limited
         rights related to such Option shall be cancelled and of no further
         force or effect): (x) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to
         be subject to the converted Option shall be equal to the product of (A)
         the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the original
         Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio; (y) the exercise price per share of
         Purchaser Common Stock under the converted Option shall be equal to (A)
         the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the original
         Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; and (z) upon exercise of each
         Option by a holder thereof, the aggregate number of shares of Purchaser
         Common Stock deliverable upon such exercise shall be rounded down, if
         necessary, to the nearest whole share and the aggregate exercise price
         shall be rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest cent; or

                  (ii) each Option not converted pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i)
         above, shall be converted into the right to receive cash, to be paid in
         accordance with this Section 1.3(a)(ii). All Options converted to cash
         pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii) shall terminate effective
         immediately prior to the Effective Time. In consideration of the
         foregoing, Purchaser shall make or shall cause to be made a cash
         payment to the holder of each Option, at the time provided in the final
         sentence of this Section 1.3(a)(ii), in an amount (less any applicable
         withholding taxes) equal to the number of shares of Company Common
         Stock covered by such Option multiplied by the amount by which the Cash
         Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of Company Common
         Stock under the Option converted by such holder. A holder of an Option
         who has executed a cancellation agreement, substantially in the form of
         Exhibit A-2 attached hereto ("Cancellation Agreement"), that is
         delivered by the Company to Purchaser (x) prior to the Effective Time
         shall be paid the amount to be paid pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii)
         within three (3) business days following the Effective Time, and (y)
         after the Effective Time shall be paid the amount to be paid pursuant
         to this Section 1.3(a)(ii) within five (5) business days of Purchaser's
         receipt of such Cancellation Agreement.

The adjustments provided in Section 1.3(a)(i) above shall be effected in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

         (b) The Company shall amend each Company Stock Option Plan (as defined
below) to provide for the conversion or cancellation of Options in accordance
with this Section 1.3 (such amendments may be referred to herein together as the
"Plan Amendments"). The Company shall also provide to Purchaser a notice
identifying the conversion option


                                      - 3 -
<PAGE>

applicable to holders of the Options under Section 1.3(a) not less than five (5)
business days prior to the Effective Time. Such notice shall provide: (i) the
name of the holder of such Option; (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Option; (iii) the exercise price of such Option; and (iv)
whether such Option shall be converted or cancelled as selected by the holder of
such Option. In the event the Company fails to provide a conversion method for
an Option pursuant to this Section 1.3, such Option shall be cancelled and paid
pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(ii).

         1.4 Consummation of the Merger; Effective Time. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be consummated (the "Closing") at the offices of Vedder, Price,
Kaufman & Kammholz, P.C., 222 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois, on such
date and time as shall be fixed by mutual agreement of Purchaser and the Company
as promptly as practicable on or after the second business day of January 2006,
but not later than ten (10) business days thereafter, or, if later, ten (10)
business days (unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, such agreement not to
be unreasonably withheld) after all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than the receipt of closing certificates and legal opinions) have first
been fulfilled or waived, provided such conditions shall continue, on such tenth
business day, to be fulfilled or waived, including the conditions which, by
their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date and/or at the Effective
Time (the date of such closing being, the "Closing Date"). At the Closing,
Purchaser and the Company shall cause the Merger to become effective by causing
a certificate of merger substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B (the
"Certificate of Merger") to be executed in accordance with the DGCL and to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The time at which
the Merger becomes effective shall be referred to as the "Effective Time."

         1.5 Merger Consideration. (a) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
5.17(b) and the provisions of this Section 1.5, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.2(c) and Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted at the election of the holder thereof, subject to and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into either:

                  (i) the right to receive in cash from Purchaser, without
         interest, an amount equal to $34.69 (the "Cash Consideration"); or

                  (ii) the right to receive from Purchaser that number of shares
         of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined
         below) (the "Stock Consideration"). The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal
         to .8082; or

                  (iii) the right to receive a combination of the foregoing in
         accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement.

         "Merger Consideration" means the Stock Consideration, the Cash
Consideration or any combination thereof, in each case subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 5.17(b) and as determined in accordance with the election
and proration procedures set forth in this Section 1.5.

         (b) Maximum Conversion Numbers. Subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 5.17(b): (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be
converted into


                                      - 4 -
<PAGE>

the right to receive Cash Consideration for such shares (including any such
shares subject to the cash portion of a Combination Election (as defined
below)), shall be 40.07% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 1.2(c) and Dissenting Shares) (the "Cash
Conversion Number"); (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to
be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration for such shares
(including any such shares subject to the stock portion of a Combination
Election) shall be 59.93% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 1.2(c) and Dissenting Shares) (the "Stock
Conversion Number"); and (iii) the maximum number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock which may be issued as Stock Consideration will be equal to the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by Stock Conversion Number and the maximum amount of cash which
will be paid as Cash Consideration will be equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by Cash Conversion Number.

         (c) Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters. If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, each of the outstanding shares of
Purchaser Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or into a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

         (d) Election Procedures.

                  (i) All elections contemplated by Section 1.5(a) shall be made
         on a form designed for that purpose prepared by the Company and
         reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (an "Election Form"). Holders of
         record of shares of Company Common Stock who hold such shares as
         nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities
         ("Representatives") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that
         such Representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all
         the shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Representative for
         a particular beneficial owner.

                  (ii) The Election Form shall be mailed on the same date as the
         date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to all holders of record of
         shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date of the
         Stockholders' Meeting (as defined below). Thereafter the Company and
         Purchaser shall each use its reasonable and diligent efforts to (i)
         mail the Election Form to all persons who become record holders of
         shares of Company Common Stock during the period between the record
         date for the Stockholders' Meeting and 5:00 p.m., Chicago Time, on the
         day five (5) business days prior to the date of the Stockholders'
         Meeting and (ii) make the Election Form available to all persons who
         become holders of shares of Company Common Stock subsequent to such day
         and no later than the close of business on the day prior to the
         Stockholders' Meeting. In order to be effective, an Election Form must
         be received by the Exchange Agent (as defined below), on or before 5:00
         p.m., Chicago Time, on the business day prior to the Stockholders'
         Meeting (the "Election Deadline"). An election shall have been properly
         made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly
         completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form
         shall be deemed properly


                                      - 5 -
<PAGE>

         completed only if accompanied by one or more certificates theretofore
         representing Company Common Stock ("Certificate(s)") (or customary
         affidavits and, if required by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.6(a),
         indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates
         or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all
         shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together
         with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election
         Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Election Form, the
         Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether
         any election has been properly or timely made and to disregard
         immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions
         of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
         conclusive. All elections will be revocable until the Election Deadline
         and thereafter shall be irrevocable.

                  (iii) Each Election Form shall entitle the holder of shares of
         Company Common Stock (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and
         customary documentation and instructions) to (i) elect to receive the
         Cash Consideration for all of such holder's shares (a "Cash Election"),
         (ii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such holder's
         shares (a "Stock Election"), (iii) elect to receive the Cash
         Consideration with respect to some of such holder's shares and the
         Stock Consideration with respect to such holder's remaining shares (a
         "Mixed Election"), or (iv) make no election or indicate that such
         holder has no preference as to the receipt of the Cash Consideration or
         the Stock Consideration (a "Non-Election"). Shares of Company Common
         Stock as to which a valid Cash Election has been made (including
         pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein as "Cash Election
         Shares." The aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock as to
         which a valid Cash Election is made is referred to herein as the "Cash
         Election Number." Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a valid
         Stock Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election)
         are referred to herein as "Stock Election Shares." The aggregate number
         of shares of Company Common Stock as to which a valid Stock Election is
         made is referred to herein as the "Stock Election Number." Shares of
         Company Common Stock as to which a Non-Election is deemed in effect are
         referred to as "Non-Election Shares." All shares of Company Common
         Stock of a holder whose properly completed Election Form is not
         received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline shall be
         deemed to be Non-Election Shares. If the Exchange Agent shall have
         determined that any purported election was not properly made, such
         purported election shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the
         shares of Company Common Stock subject to such purported election shall
         for purposes hereof be deemed to be Non-Election Shares.

         (e) Proration Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Election
Deadline, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

                  (i) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion
         Number, then:

                           (A) all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election
                  Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
                  Consideration, and


                                      - 6 -
<PAGE>

                           (B) each holder of Stock Election Shares shall have
                  the right to receive:

                                    (1) the number of shares of Purchaser Common
                           Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying
                           (a) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such
                           holder by (b) the Exchange Ratio by (c) a fraction
                           (rounded to four decimal places) the numerator of
                           which is the Stock Conversion Number and the
                           denominator of which is the Stock Election Number
                           (the "Stock Proration Factor"), and

                                    (2) cash in an amount equal to the product
                           obtained by multiplying (a) the number of Stock
                           Election Shares held by such holder by (b) the Cash
                           Consideration by (c) one minus the Stock Proration
                           Factor.

                  (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock
         Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number
         exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the
         "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted
         into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election
         Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following
         manner:

                           (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to
                  the number of Non-Election Shares, then:

                                    (1) all Cash Election Shares shall be
                           converted into the right to receive the Cash
                           Consideration; and

                                    (2) each holder of Non-Election Shares shall
                           have the right to receive (a) the number of shares of
                           Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product obtained
                           by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares
                           held by such holder by (y) the Exchange Ratio by (z)
                           a fraction (rounded to four decimal places) the
                           numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
                           denominator of which is the total number of
                           Non-Election Shares (the "Non-Election Proration
                           Factor") and (b) cash in an amount equal to the
                           product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
                           Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the
                           Cash Consideration by (z) one minus the Non-Election
                           Proration Factor; or

                           (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of
                  Non-Election Shares, then:

                                    (1) all Non-Election Shares shall be
                           converted into the right to receive the Stock
                           Consideration; and

                                    (2) each holder of Cash Election Shares
                           shall have the right to receive (a) the number of
                           shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product
                           obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash
                           Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the
                           Exchange Ratio by (z) a


                                      - 7 -
<PAGE>

                           fraction (rounded to four decimal places) the
                           numerator of which is the amount by which the
                           Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
                           Shares and the denominator of which is the Cash
                           Election Number (the "Cash Proration Factor") and (b)
                           cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by
                           multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares
                           held by such holder by (y) the Cash Consideration by
                           (z) one minus the Cash Proration Factor.

                  (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section
         5.13, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, direct at any time prior
         to the Effective Time that the proration procedures provided in this
         subsection (d) not be implemented.

         1.6 Exchange of Company Common Stock. (a) Surrender of Certificates. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than five (5)
business days following the Effective Time, Computershare Investor Services LLP
or such other firm selected by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser and the Company consistent with the terms hereof, shall mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate who did not previously submit a properly
completed Election Form together with duly executed transmittal materials prior
to the Election Deadline: (i) a form letter of transmittal which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or a lost certificate
affidavit and bond in a form reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent) to the
Exchange Agent; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (in the form or forms
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.5). Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent (or a lost certificate
affidavit and bond in a form reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent),
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, (i) a
certificate evidencing the whole number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock into
which the shares of Company Common Stock, theretofore represented by the
Certificate so surrendered, shall have been converted pursuant to the provisions
of Section 1.5, if any, plus (ii) a check for the aggregate amount of cash,
without interest, which such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.5, if any, including any cash amount payable in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with Section 1.6(c). Certificates so surrendered shall be
cancelled. Purchaser shall direct the Exchange Agent to make such deliveries
within five (5) business days of the receipt of all required documentation. If
any Purchaser Common Stock to be exchanged for shares of Company Common Stock is
to be delivered in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition to the exchange that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer, that all signatures shall be guaranteed by a member firm of
any national securities exchange in the United States or the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or by a commercial bank or trust
company or other financial institution acceptable to Purchaser having an office
in the United States, and that the person requesting the payment shall either
(a) pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or (b) establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such taxes have been paid or are not payable. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of any
shares of Company Common Stock


                                      - 8 -
<PAGE>

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and any such shares of
Company Common Stock presented to the Exchange Agent shall be cancelled in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto as provided
in Section 1.5 above.

         (b) Failure to Exchange Company Common Stock. No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to Purchaser Common
Stock payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to Purchaser
Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any holder until the holder of record shall surrender
such Certificate. Subject to the effect, if any, of applicable law, after the
subsequent surrender and exchange of a Certificate, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or distributions, without interest
thereon, which theretofore became payable with respect to the Purchaser Common
Stock represented by such Certificate. All dividends or other distributions
declared on or after the Effective Time with respect to the Purchaser Common
Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof on or after the Effective
Time which are payable to the holder of a Certificate not theretofore
surrendered and exchanged for Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to this Section
1.6(b) shall be paid or delivered by Purchaser to the Exchange Agent, in trust,
for the benefit of such holders. All such dividends and distributions held by
the Exchange Agent for payment or delivery to the holders of unsurrendered
Certificates unclaimed at the end of one (1) year from the Effective Time shall
be repaid or redelivered by the Exchange Agent to Purchaser after which time any
holder of Certificates who has not theretofore surrendered such Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, subject to applicable law, shall look only to Purchaser for
payment or delivery of such dividends or distributions, as the case may be. Any
shares of Purchaser Common Stock or other consideration delivered or made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 1.6(b) and not
exchanged for Certificates within one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
returned by the Exchange Agent to Purchaser which shall thereafter act as
exchange agent subject to the rights of holders of unsurrendered Certificates
hereunder.

         (c) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender or exchange
of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Purchaser shall relate to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or assert any rights of a stockholder of Purchaser. In lieu of
any fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser shall cause to be paid
to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled
to receive a fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock an amount of cash,
rounded to the nearest cent (without interest), equal to the product of such
fraction multiplied by the Cash Consideration.

         (d) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a
former holder of Company Common Stock for any consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable escheat or abandoned property laws.

         (e) Exchange Fund. On the date the Effective Time occurs, Purchaser
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit
of the holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, an


                                      - 9 -
<PAGE>

aggregate amount of cash, sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.5 of this Agreement (plus an additional amount of
cash sufficient to cover amounts payable in lieu of any fractional shares of
Company Common Stock).

                                      II.

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

         Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that:

         2.1 Organization. (a) Purchaser is a corporation duly organized,

operate and lease its assets, properties and businesses, and to carry on its
business substantially as it has been and is now being conducted. Purchaser is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the
business transacted by it requires that it be so qualified, except where the
failure to so qualify would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement, and, upon the approval of the Governmental
Authorities (as defined below), to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Purchaser is duly registered as a unitary savings and loan holding
company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended ("HOLA").

         (b) Mid America is a federally-chartered stock savings bank duly
organized and in existence under the laws of the United States. Mid America is
an "insured depository institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act (the "FDI Act") and applicable regulations thereunder, the deposits of which
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") through the
Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") to the full extent permitted under
applicable laws.

         (c) Purchaser has no direct or indirect subsidiaries other than MAF
Developments, Inc., Mid America Investment Services, Inc., Mid America Finance

forth on Schedule 2.1(c) to the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, each of the
Purchaser Corporate Subsidiaries is either wholly-owned by Purchaser or Mid
America or by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mid America, and is a duly organized
and validly existing corporation, limited liability company or statutory trust,
as applicable, in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business transacted by it
requires that it be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified
does not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, with corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its assets and properties and carry on its
business substantially as it has been and is now being conducted.

         2.7 Purchaser Reports. (a) Since January 1, 2002, each of Purchaser and
the Purchaser Subsidiaries has timely filed all reports and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that were required

applicable state banking, insurance, securities, or other regulatory authorities
(except filings which are not material), and (e) Nasdaq (collectively, the
"Purchaser Reports"). Purchaser has previously made available to the Company
true and complete copies of the Purchaser Reports requested by the Company. As
of their respective filing dates, each of such reports and documents (after
giving effect to any amendments thereto), including the financial statements,
exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the statutes, rules, and regulations enforced or
promulgated by the authority with which they were filed and did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

         (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.7(b) to the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule and except for examinations or reviews conducted in the regular course
of the business of Purchaser or the Purchaser Subsidiaries by the SEC, Internal
Revenue Service, Department of Labor, state, and local taxing authorities, OTS
or the FDIC, no Federal, state or local governmental agency, commission or other
entity has initiated any proceeding or, to the best knowledge of Purchaser,
investigation into the business or operations of Purchaser or the Purchaser
Subsidiaries within the past three years. None of Purchaser or any Purchaser
Subsidiary is subject to a written agreement (as such term is defined pursuant
to 12 U.S.C. ss.1818) with the OTS or the FDIC. There is no unresolved
violation, criticism or exception by the SEC, OTS or FDIC, or other agency,
commission or entity with respect to any Purchaser Report that would constitute
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

         2.8 Compliance With Laws. (a) The businesses of Purchaser and each
Purchaser Subsidiary are being conducted in compliance with all applicable
Federal and state laws, ordinances and regulations of any governmental entity,
including, without limitation, HOLA, the FDI Act, any laws affecting financial
institutions (including those pertaining to the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA
Patriot Act, the investment of funds, the lending of money, the collection of
interest and the extension of credit), Federal and state securities laws, laws
and regulations relating to financial statements and reports, truth-in-lending,

standards and laws and regulations relating to employee benefits, and any
statutes or ordinances relating to the properties occupied or used by Purchaser
or any Purchaser Subsidiary, except for any violations which either singly or in
the aggregate do not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.8(b) to the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, no investigation or review by any governmental entity with respect to
Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary is pending or, to the best knowledge of
the Company, threatened, nor has any governmental entity indicated to Purchaser
an intention to conduct the same, other than normal bank regulatory
examinations.


                                     - 13 -

         2.9 Litigation. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding,
legal, quasi-judicial, administrative or otherwise, pending or, to the best
knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against or affecting Purchaser or any
Purchaser Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents, in their capacities as such, which, if adversely determined, would
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, or which is
seeking to enjoin consummation of the transactions provided for herein or to
obtain other relief in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, having, or which could reasonably be foreseen to have in
the future, any such effect.

         2.10 Defaults. There has not been any default, or the occurrence of an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default, in
any obligation to be performed by Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary under
any contract, commitment, or other material obligation to which Purchaser, any
Purchaser Subsidiary or their respective properties is subject, and neither
Purchaser nor any Purchaser Subsidiary has waived any right under any contract
or commitment, except in each case where any such default or waiver, singly or
in the aggregate with any other such defaults or waivers, would not have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. To the best knowledge of Purchaser, no other
party to any such material contract or commitment is in default in any material
obligation to be performed by such party.

         2.11 Absence of Purchaser Material Adverse Change. Except as may be
disclosed in Purchaser Reports, since December 31, 2004, there has not occurred
a Purchaser Material Adverse Change.

         2.12 Undisclosed Liabilities. All of the obligations or liabilities
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due
or becoming due, and regardless of when asserted) arising out of transactions or
events heretofore entered into, or any action or inaction, including taxes with
respect to or based upon transactions or events heretofore occurring, that are
required to be reflected, disclosed or reserved against in the audited
consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP ("Liabilities") have,
in the case of Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, been so reflected,
disclosed or reserved against in the audited consolidated financial statements
of Purchaser as of December 31, 2004 or in the notes thereto, and Purchaser and
the Purchaser Subsidiaries have no other Liabilities, except Liabilities
incurred since December 31, 2004 in the ordinary course of business.

         2.13 Licenses. To the best knowledge Purchaser, Purchaser and each
Purchaser Subsidiary, respectively, hold all governmental registrations,
licenses, permits or franchises (each a "Purchaser Permit") required to be held
by it and which are material with respect to the operation of their respective
businesses, except for such Purchaser Permits which the failure to hold would
not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

         2.14 Government Approvals. To the best knowledge of Purchaser, no fact
or condition exists with respect to Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary that
Purchaser has reason to believe will prevent it from obtaining approval of the
Merger, the Bank Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
any Governmental Authority.

         2.15 Fees. Other than the financial advisory services performed for
Purchaser by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., neither Purchaser nor any


                                     - 14 -

of the Purchaser Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents, has employed a broker or finder or incurred any liability
for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions, or finder's fees,
and no broker or finder has acted directly or indirectly for Purchaser or any
Purchaser Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         2.16 Disclosure. None of the information to be supplied by Purchaser
for inclusion or to be incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement or the
information relating to Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries in the
Registration Statement, will, in the case of the Proxy Statement after giving
effect to any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the
Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or, in the
case of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The portions
of the Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and any other document filed by Purchaser under
the Securities Exchange Act which are included with or incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement relating to Purchaser comply
or will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act.

         2.17 Availability of Funds. Purchaser has or will have available to it
at the Effective Time, sources of capital sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration and to pay any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
and to effect the transactions contemplated hereby.

         2.18 Controls and Procedures. (a) Each of the principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Purchaser has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under the
Exchange Act (collectively, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect to Purchaser
Reports, and Purchaser has made available to the Company a summary of any
disclosure made by management to Purchaser's auditors and audit committee since
January 1, 2002 referred to in such certifications. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

         (b) Purchaser has (i) designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Purchaser in the
reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is communicated to
its management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to Purchaser's
auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors (A) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Purchaser's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Purchaser's internal control
over financial reporting. Purchaser has made available to the Company true and
correct copies of any of the foregoing disclosures to the auditors or audit
committee that have been made in writing from


                                     - 15 -

Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance concerning the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements

(i) that transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorizations and recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability, (ii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations, and (iii) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any difference.

         (d) Since December 31, 2004, (i) neither Purchaser nor any Purchaser
Subsidiary nor, to the best knowledge of Purchaser, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Purchaser or any of the

options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls, or commitments of any
character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable for, shares of the capital stock of any Company Subsidiary. The
former minority shareholder of Computer Dynamics Group, Inc has no continuing
equity interest in such company and, to the best knowledge of the Company, there
is no dispute threatened with respect to such former equity ownership position.
There are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements relating to
the rights of the Company to vote or to dispose of shares of the capital stock
of any Company Subsidiary. All of the shares of capital stock of each Company
Subsidiary held by the Company or the Bank are fully paid and non-assessable and
are owned by the Company or the Bank free and clear of any claim, lien or
encumbrance.

respects with the applicable provisions of the statutes, rules, and regulations

Subsidiaries, no Federal, state or local governmental agency, commission or
other entity has initiated any proceeding or, to the best knowledge of the
Company, investigation into the business or operations of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries within the past three years. None of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is subject to a written agreement (as such term is defined
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. ss.1818) with the IDFPR or the FDIC. There is no
unresolved violation, criticism or exception by the SEC, IDFPR or FDIC, or other

statutes or ordinances relating to the properties occupied or used by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for possible violations which either
singly or in the aggregate do not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
which would not interfere with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

         (b) The policies, programs and practices of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary relating to wages, hours of work, and other terms and
conditions of employment are in compliance in all material respects with
applicable laws, orders, regulations, public policies and ordinances governing
employment and terms and conditions of employment. There are no disputes,
claims, or charges, pending or, to the best knowledge of Company, threatened,
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary alleging breach of any express or
implied employment contract or commitment, or material breach of any applicable
law, order, regulation, public policy or ordinance relating to employment or
terms and conditions of employment, and, to the best knowledge of the Company,
there is no basis for any valid claim or charge with regard to such matters.

         (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8(c) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no investigation or review by any governmental entity with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or, to the best knowledge of

Company an intention to conduct the same, other than normal bank regulatory
examinations.

agents, in their capacities as such, which is seeking damages against the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or

                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>

agents, in their capacities as such, in excess of $50,000, or which would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or which is
seeking to enjoin consummation of the transactions provided for herein or to
obtain other relief in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, having, or which could reasonably be foreseen to have in
the future, any such effect.

         3.10 Defaults. There has not been any default, or the occurrence of an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default, in
any obligation to be performed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under
any contract, commitment, or other material obligation to which the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or their respective properties is subject, and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any right under any contract or
commitment, except in each case where any such default or waiver, singly or in
the aggregate with any other such defaults or waivers, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10 to the Company
Disclosure Schedules, to the best knowledge of the Company, no other party to
any such material contract or commitment is in default in any material
obligation to be performed by such party.

         3.11 Absence of Company Material Adverse Change. Since December 31,
2004, there has not been, except for the transactions as contemplated herein or
matters related thereto, a Company Material Adverse Change.

         3.12 Undisclosed Liabilities. All of the obligations or Liabilities
have, in the case of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, been so
reflected, disclosed or reserved against in the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of December 31, 2004 or in the notes thereto, and
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no other Liabilities except (i)
Liabilities incurred since December 31, 2004 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice that either alone or when combined with all
similar Liabilities, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) Liabilities (including legal,
accounting, financial advising fees and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         3.13 Licenses. The Company and each Company Subsidiary, respectively,
hold all governmental registrations, licenses, permits or franchises (each a
"Company Permit") required to be held by it and which are material with respect
to the operation of their respective businesses as presently conducted.

         3.14 Governmental and Stockholder Approvals. To the best knowledge of
the Company, no fact or condition exists which the Company has reason to believe
will prevent the parties from obtaining approval of the Merger, the Bank Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental
Authority or the stockholders of the Company.

         3.15 Antitakeover Provisions Inapplicable. Other than Section 203 of
the DGCL, no "business combination," "moratorium," "control share" or other
state antitakeover statute or regulation, nor any provision in the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, (i) prohibits or restricts the
Company's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or its
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) would have the
effect of


                                     - 21 -
<PAGE>

invalidating or voiding this Agreement, or any provision hereof or thereof, or
(iii) would subject Purchaser to any impediment or condition in connection with
the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement. The Company has taken
all steps necessary to cause the restrictions on "business combinations" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         3.16 Disclosure. None of the information to be supplied by the Company
for inclusion or to be incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement or the
information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the
Registration Statement, will, in the case of the Proxy Statement after giving
effect to any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the
Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or, in the
case of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective and at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading. The portions of the Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed by the Company
under the Securities Exchange Act which are included with or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement relating to the Company comply and will comply
as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act.

         3.17 Taxes. (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17 to the Company
Disclosure Schedules, the Company, each Company Subsidiary and each other
company or joint venture where the Company or a Company Subsidiary owns 50% or
more of the equity interest of such entity measured by either vote or value (a
"Tax Subsidiary") have each timely filed all tax and information returns,
including but not limited to all required Forms 1099, 1098 and 5498, required to

taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary that have not been resolved or settled and no
requests for waivers of the time to assess any such tax are pending or have been
agreed to. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the income tax returns of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and
Tax Subsidiary have not been audited by either the Internal Revenue Service, or
any state or local taxing authorities, for any of the last ten years. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary is a party to any
action or proceeding by any governmental authority for the assessment or the
collection of taxes. Deferred taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
have been accounted for in accordance with GAAP. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.17 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each Company Subsidiary
have delivered or made available to Purchaser correct and complete copies of all
Federal and state income tax returns and supporting schedules for all tax years
since December 31, 2000.

         (b) The Company has not filed any consolidated Federal income tax
return with an "affiliated group" (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
Code) where the Company was not the common parent of the group. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary is, or has been, a party to
any tax allocation agreement or arrangement pursuant to which it has any
contingent or outstanding liability to anyone other than the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary.

         (c) The Company, each Company Subsidiary and each Tax Subsidiary have

         3.18 Insurance. The Company and each Company Subsidiary maintain
insurance with an insurer which in the best judgment of management of the
Company is sound and reputable, on their respective assets, and upon their
respective businesses and operations, against loss or damage, risks, hazards and
liabilities of the kinds customarily insured against by prudent corporations
engaged in the same or similar businesses. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary maintain in effect all insurance required to be carried by law or by
any agreement by which they are bound. All material claims under all policies of
insurance maintained by the Company and the Bank have been filed in due and
timely fashion. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has had an
insurance policy cancelled by the issuer of the policy within the past five (5)
years.

         3.19 Loans; Investments. (a) Each loan reflected as an asset on the
Company Financial Statements is evidenced by appropriate and sufficient
documentation in all material respects and constitutes, the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with
its terms except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to
or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or equitable
principles or doctrines; to the knowledge of the Company, no obligor named
therein is seeking to avoid the enforceability of the terms of any loan under
any such laws or equitable principles or doctrines and no loan is subject to any
defense, offset or counterclaim. All such loans originated by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and all such loans purchased by the Company or any Company

standards of the Company and any Company Subsidiary and in the ordinary course
of business of the Company and each Company Subsidiary. Set forth on Schedule
3.19(a)(i) is a complete list of all outstanding commitments under which the

Subsidiary, including but not limited to those of the Federal Housing
Administration, the Small Business Administration, and other state and Federal
agencies, are valid and enforceable, except to the extent enforceability thereof
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or equitable principles or doctrines.

         (c) In originating, purchasing, underwriting, servicing, and
discharging loans, mortgages, land contracts, and contractual obligations
relating thereto, either for their own account or for the account of others, the
Company and each Company Subsidiary have complied in all material respects with
all applicable terms and conditions of such obligations and with all applicable
laws, regulations, rules, contractual requirements, and procedures with respect
to such servicing.

         (d) None of the investments reflected in the Company Financial
Statements and none of the investments made by the Company since December 31,
2004, is subject to any restriction, whether contractual or statutory, which
materially impairs the ability of the Company freely to dispose of such
investment at any time. With respect to all material repurchase agreements to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, the Company or such
Company Subsidiary has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in the
government securities or other collateral securing each such repurchase
agreement, and the value of the collateral securing each such repurchase
agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured by such collateral
under such agreement. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has sold or
otherwise disposed of any assets in a transaction in which the acquiror of such
assets or other person has the right, either conditionally or absolutely, to
require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase or otherwise
reacquire any such assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19(d)(i) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
purchased or otherwise acquired any loans or other assets in a transaction in
which the seller of such loans or other assets, or other person, has the right,
either conditionally or absolutely, to repurchase such loans or other assets
from the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of the occurrence of the
transactions contemplated herein or otherwise. Set forth on Schedule 3.19(d)(ii)
to the Company Disclosure Schedule is a complete and accurate list of each
investment and debt security, mortgage-backed and related securities, marketable
equity securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell owned by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, showing as of May 31, 2005, the carrying
values and estimated fair values of investment and debt securities, the gross
carrying value and estimated fair value of the mortgage-backed and related
securities and the cost and estimated fair value of the marketable equity
securities.

         (e) All United States Treasury securities, obligations of other United
States Government agencies and corporations, obligations of States of the United
States and their political subdivisions, and other investment securities

Company or any Company Subsidiary, as reflected in the Company Financial
Statements were classified and accounted for in accordance with F.A.S.B. 115 and
the intentions of management.

         3.20 Interest Rate Risk Management Arrangements. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any, nor is any property bound by, any
interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements or other interest rate
risk management arrangements.

         3.21 Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses shown on
the Company Financial Statements, as of such date was (and will be as of such
subsequent financial statement dates) in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
adequate in all respects to provide for possible or specific losses, net of
recoveries relating to loans previously charged off, on loans outstanding, and
contained an additional amount of unallocated reserves for unanticipated future
losses at a level considered adequate under the standards applied by applicable
Federal and/or state regulatory authorities and based upon generally accepted
practices applicable to financial institutions and based upon GAAP.

         3.22 Company Benefit Plans. (a) Schedule 3.22(a)(i) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a list and a true and correct copy (or, a
description with respect to any oral employee benefit plan, practice, policy or
arrangement), including all amendments thereto, of each compensation,
consulting, employment, termination or collective bargaining agreement, and each
stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, recognition and
retention, life, health, accident or other insurance, bonus, deferred or
incentive compensation, severance or separation agreement or any agreement
providing any payment or benefit resulting from a change in control, profit
sharing, retirement, or other employee benefit plan, practice, policy or
arrangement of any kind, oral or written, covering employees, former employees,
directors or former directors of the Company or each Company Subsidiary or their
respective beneficiaries, including, but not limited to, any employee benefit
plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary maintains, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
contributes, or under which any employee, former employee, director or former
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is covered or has benefit
rights and pursuant to which any liability of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary exists or is reasonably likely to occur (the "Company Benefit
Plans"), and current summary plan descriptions, trust agreements, and insurance
contracts and Internal Revenue Service Form 5500 or 5500-C/R (for the three most
recently completed plan years) with respect thereto. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.22(a)(ii) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company neither
maintains nor has entered into any Company Benefit Plan or other document, plan
or agreement which contains any change in control provisions which would cause
an increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements to employees or
former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective
beneficiaries, or other provisions, which would cause an increase in the
liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or to Purchaser as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any related action
thereafter (a "Change in Control Benefit"). The term "Company Benefit Plans" as
used herein refers to all plans contemplated under the preceding sentences of
this Section 3.22, provided that the term "Plan" or "Plans" is used in this
Agreement for convenience only and does not constitute an acknowledgment that a
particular arrangement is an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has been notified by any Governmental Authority to amend any payments
or other compensation paid or payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
under this Agreement, any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, to or for the
benefit of any employee or director of the Company or


                                     - 25 -
<PAGE>

any Company Subsidiary and, to the best knowledge of the Company, all such
payments are in compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and bulletins
promulgated by the Governmental Authorities.

         (b) Each of the Company Benefit Plans that is intended to be a pension,
profit sharing, stock bonus, thrift, savings or employee stock ownership plan
that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code ("Company Qualified Plans")
has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code and an application for determination of such qualification
has been timely made to the Internal Revenue Service prior to the end of the
applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code (a copy of
each such determination letter and each pending application is included in
Schedule 3.22(b) to the Company Disclosure Schedule), and, to the best knowledge
of the Company, there exist no circumstances likely to materially adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Company Qualified Plan. All such Company
Qualified Plans established or maintained by the Company or each Company
Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary contribute are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements of ERISA,
and are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements
(including qualification and non-discrimination requirements in effect as of the
Effective Time) of the Code for obtaining the tax benefits the Code thereupon
permits with respect to such Company Qualified Plans. No Company Qualified Plan
is a defined benefit pension plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA. All
accrued contributions and other payments required to be made by the Company or
each Company Subsidiary to any Company Benefit Plan through the date hereof,
have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes as of the date hereof,
have been set aside therefor and reflected in the Company Financial Statements.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has accumulated any funding
deficiency under Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is in material default in performing any of its respective
contractual obligations under any of the Company Benefit Plans or any related
trust agreement or insurance contract, and there are no material outstanding
liabilities of any such Plan other than liabilities for benefits to be paid to
participants in such Plan and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms
of such Plan.

         (c) There is no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
threatened litigation or pending claim (other than individual benefit claims
made in the ordinary course) by or on behalf of or against any of the Company
Benefit Plans (or with respect to the administration of any of such Plans) now
or heretofore maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary which allege
violations of applicable state or Federal law or the terms of the Plan which are
reasonably likely to result in a liability on the part of Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any such Plan.

         (d) The Company and each Company Subsidiary and all other persons
having fiduciary or other responsibilities or duties with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan are, and since the inception of each such Plan have been, in
substantial compliance with, and each such Plan is and has been operated in
substantial accordance with, its provisions and in substantial compliance with
the applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such Plan, including,
without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") and the Internal
Revenue Service under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law. No
"reportable event" (as defined in


                                     - 26 -
<PAGE>

Section 4043(c) of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.
No Company Benefit Plan has engaged in or been a party to a "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code)
without an exemption thereto under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(d) of
the Code. All Company Benefit Plans that are group health plans have been
operated in compliance with the group health plan continuation requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-609 of ERISA and with the
certification of prior coverage and other requirements of Sections 701-702 of
ERISA.

         (e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred, nor to
the best knowledge of the Company or such Company Subsidiary is reasonably
likely to incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA in connection with any
Plan subject to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA now or heretofore maintained
or contributed to by it or by the Bank.

         (f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any
payments, or is or has been a party to any agreement or any Company Benefit
Plan, that under any circumstances could obligate it, any Company Subsidiary, or
any successor of any of them, to make any payment that is not or will not be
deductible in full because of Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code.

         (g) Schedule 3.22(g) to the Company Disclosure Schedule describes any
obligation that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has to provide health or
welfare benefits to retirees or other former employees, directors or their
dependents (other than rights under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of
ERISA), including information as to the number of retirees, other former
employees or directors and dependents entitled to such coverages, their ages, a
description of such health or welfare benefit, the annual cost incurred to
provide such benefits and the portion of such cost that is paid by such retiree
or former employee or director.

         3.24 Material Contracts. Schedule 3.24(i) to the Company Disclosure

in excess of $25,000 to which the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or to which the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
properties are subject (collectively, the "Material Contracts" and each a
"Material Contract"). True copies of each Material Contract are set forth on
Schedule 3.24(i) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, including all material
amendments and supplements thereto. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.24(ii) to
the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the Material Contracts are binding


                                     - 29 -
<PAGE>

upon the Company and/or Company Subsidiaries (as applicable) and, to the
Company's best knowledge, the other parties thereto. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have each duly performed in all material respects all of its
obligations under each Material Contract to which they are a party to the extent
that such obligations to perform have accrued. No breach or default under any
Material Contract by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the
Company's knowledge, any other party thereto, has occurred which has a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.24(iii) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Material Contracts contains an express
prohibition against assignment by operation of law or a change of control of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary (or require written consent or notice to the
other party), or contains any other provision which would preclude Purchaser
from exercising and enjoying all of the rights, remedies and obligations of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, under such Material
Contracts as a result of entering into this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger.

         3.25 Real Property. (a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary and Tax
Subsidiary have good and marketable title to their real properties, including
any leaseholds and ground leases, and their other assets and properties, all as
reflected as owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the Company
Financial Statements dated as of March 31, 2005 except for (i) assets and
properties disposed of since such date in the ordinary course of business and
(ii) such liens, claims, mortgages, security interests, leases, agreements and
tenancies, licenses, options, options to purchase, covenants, conditions,
restrictions, rights of way, easements, judgments, and other matters affecting
the real properties as set forth on Schedule 3.25(a)(i) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule or as identified on the title policies listed on such
Schedule. All buildings, structures, fixtures and appurtenances comprising part
of the real properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether owned
or leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary) are in good operating
condition and have been well maintained, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Title
to all real property listed as being owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary on the Company Disclosure Schedule is held in fee simple. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary have title or other rights to its assets sufficient
in all material respects for the conduct of their respective businesses as
presently conducted, and, except as set forth on Schedule 3.25(a)(ii) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, such assets are free, clear and discharged of, from
any and all liens, charges, encumbrances, security interests and/or equities.
Set forth on Schedule 3.25(a)(i) to the Company Disclosure Schedule is evidence
of title to all real property owned by the Company or the Bank.

         (b) All leases pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
as lessee, leases real or personal property are, to the best knowledge of the
Company, valid, effective, and enforceable against the lessor in accordance with
their respective terms. There is not under any of such leases any existing
default, or any event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default, with respect to either the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or to the best knowledge of the Company, the other party. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.25(b) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of such
leases contains a prohibition against assignment by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, by operation of law or otherwise, or any other provision which in
either case would preclude the Company or any Company Subsidiary from possessing
and using the leased premises for the same purposes and upon the same rental and
other terms upon the consummation of the Merger as are applicable to the
possession and use by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the date of
this


                                     - 30 -
<PAGE>

Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made a prior
assignment for collateral purposes of any such lease.

         3.26 Indemnification. To the best knowledge of the Company, no action
or failure to take action by any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or each Company Subsidiary has occurred which would give rise to a claim
or a potential claim by any such person for indemnification from the Company or
any Company Subsidiary under the corporate indemnification provisions of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in effect on the date of this Agreement.

         3.27 Insider Interests. All outstanding loans and other contractual
arrangements (including deposit relationships) between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any officer, director or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary conform to the applicable rules and regulations and
requirements of all applicable regulatory agencies which were in effect when
such loans and other contractual arrangements were entered into. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.27 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, no officer, director
or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material interest
in any property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, used in or pertaining
to the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. With the exception of
any deposit or lending relationships with any Company Subsidiary, set forth on
Schedule 3.27 to the Company Disclosure Schedule is a description of all
relationships and transactions with the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the
type required to be disclosed by the Company under the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act pursuant to Items 401(d) and 404 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act without
regard to any dollar thresholds therein.

         3.28 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of the Company has
received an opinion, dated the date of this Agreement, from Hovde Financial,
LLC, that, subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration is fair to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view.

         3.29 Fees. Other than the financial advisory services performed for the
Company by Hovde Financial, LLC, neither the Company, nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents, has employed a broker or finder or incurred any liability for any
financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions, or finder's fees, and no
broker or finder has acted directly or indirectly for the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is communicated to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board of
Directors (A) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company has provided to
Purchaser true and correct copies of any of the foregoing disclosures to the
auditors or audit committee that have been made in writing from January 1, 2004
through the date hereof, and will promptly provide to Purchaser true and correct
copies of any such disclosure that is made after the date hereof.

         (c) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance concerning the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements

(i) that transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorizations and recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability, (ii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations, and (iii) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any difference.

and Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) since July 31, 2002.

         (e) Since December 31, 2004, (i) neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries nor, to the best knowledge of the Company, any director,
officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any

improper or illegal accounting or auditing practices or maintains improper or
inadequate internal accounting controls and (ii) no attorney representing the

                                    COVENANTS

         4.1 Conduct of Business by the Company Until the Effective Time. During
the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the Effective
Time, the Company agrees (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or
to the extent that Purchaser shall otherwise consent in writing which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) that:

         (a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary will carry on their respective businesses in, the usual,
regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as heretofore
conducted (including ongoing review, testing, maintenance and assessment of
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting), maintain their respective books in accordance with GAAP, conduct
their respective businesses and operations only in accordance with safe and
sound banking and business practices, and, except as set forth on Schedule
4.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, use all reasonable efforts to (i)
preserve intact their present business organizations, (ii) generally keep
available the services of their present officers and employees, and (iii)
preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers, agents, brokers and
others having business dealings with them to the end that their respective
goodwill and going businesses shall be unimpaired at the Effective Time.

         (b) The Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, use

any of them in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action

dividend would be payable for that quarter on any Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued as a result of the Merger. The Company shall not make any changes in its
normal practice of declaring dividends or establishing dividend record or
dividend payment dates. It is the intent of this Section 4.1(d) that holders of
Company Common Stock receive regular payment of such cash dividends for any
quarter if declared and paid in accordance with normal past practice, on their
shares of Company Common Stock but only if dividends would not be payable during
that quarter to holders of Purchaser Common Stock received in exchange for

the assets of or otherwise, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof.

         (g) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant to
the exercise of outstanding options, the Company will not, and will not permit
any Company Subsidiary to, or enter into any agreement to, issue, sell, grant,
authorize or propose the issuance or sale of, or purchase or propose the
purchase of, permit the conversion of or otherwise acquire or transfer for any
consideration any shares of their respective capital stocks of any class or
securities convertible into, or rights, warrants or options to acquire, any such
shares or other convertible securities, or to increase or decrease the number of
shares of capital stock by split-up, reclassification, reverse split, stock
dividend, stock split or change in par or stated value. No additional shares of
Company Common Stock shall become subject to new grants of employee stock
options, stock appreciation rights, limited rights, stock grants or similar
stock-based employee compensation rights.

to, create or incur any liabilities, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, in excess of $50,000 other than the taking of deposits and
other liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practices, or permit or suffer the imposition on any shares of stock held

no contributions shall be made to any Company Qualified Plan that is a defined
benefit plan), or (iii) pay any bonus (except in accordance with past practices
or plans or agreements with respect to employees other than executive or senior
management) or increase any severance or termination pay, or enter into or amend
any employment, special termination, change in


                                     - 34 -

their best efforts to maintain their respective properties and assets in their
present states of repair, order and condition, reasonable wear and tear
excepted, and to maintain and keep in full force and effect all policies of
insurance presently in effect, including the insurance of accounts with the
FDIC. The Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, take all
requisite action (including without limitation the making of claims and the
giving of notices) pursuant to their directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies in order to preserve all rights thereunder with respect to
all matters known by Company which could reasonably give rise to a claim prior
to the Effective Time.

         (n) The Company will not, and will not permit any Company Subsidiary
to, amend their respective Certificate of Incorporation, Charters, or By-laws,
except as contemplated by this Agreement.

enter into, renew, modify or increase: (i) any loan secured by lease

make any investment or agree to make an investment in, any person or entity or
modify any of the material provisions or renew or otherwise extend the maturity
date of any existing loan, credit commitment or investment: (A) to any person or
entity involving an amount in excess of $500,000 or in any amount which, when
aggregated with any and all loans or credit commitments of the Company and Bank
to such person or entity or related entities, would be in excess of $1,000,000
(and in any event only if such loan has a loan to value ratio of not greater

of Mid America shall be permitted to attend each such meeting of the Bank.

         (q) The Company will not, and will not permit any Company Subsidiary

Purchaser Subsidiaries will carry on their respective businesses in
substantially the same manner as heretofore conducted, maintain their respective
books in accordance with GAAP, conduct their respective businesses and
operations only in accordance with safe and sound banking and business

understanding (whether written or oral), regarding any Acquisition Transaction
providing for or requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate this
Agreement, or compensating it or any Company Subsidiary under any of the
instances described in this clause. The Company shall immediately instruct and
otherwise use its best efforts to cause its agents, advisors (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), consultants and other representatives to
comply with such prohibitions. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to such activities. Notwithstanding

unsolicited after the date hereof made by any Person or group (other than
Purchaser or any of its affiliates) with respect to an Acquisition Transaction
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, could
result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below), the Company may provide

consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) which would cause such person or
group to become the beneficial owner of securities representing 15% or more of
the voting power of either the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the
Company; (iv) a tender or exchange offer to acquire securities representing 15%
or more of the

afford to Purchaser and Purchaser's accountants, counsel and other
representatives, upon reasonable notice, such reasonable access as Purchaser may

Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records,
including all attorneys' responses to auditors' requests for information and
accountants' work papers, developed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
their accountants or attorneys, and will permit the Company's representatives to
discuss such information directly with Purchaser's officers, directors,
employees, attorneys and accountants.

         (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, each party shall
upon request of the other party return all nonpublic documents furnished to it
hereunder or destroy all documents or portions thereof that contain nonpublic
information furnished by the other party pursuant hereto and, in any event,
shall hold all nonpublic information received pursuant hereto in the same degree
of confidence with which it maintains its own like information unless or until
such information is or becomes a matter of public knowledge or is or becomes
known to the party receiving the information through persons other than the
party providing such information.

         5.2 Meetings of the Company. The Company shall provide to Purchaser the

information provided to the directors on all such Boards of Directors and
committees in connection with all such meetings of directors, when the same are
provided to such directors, including minutes of prior meetings, financial
reports and any other analyses prepared by senior management of the Company. All
such information provided to Purchaser shall be treated in confidence as

shall not be required to permit Purchaser (or its representatives) to review
material or attend any portion of a meeting containing any confidential
discussion of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated


                                     - 40 -
<PAGE>

determined such review would result in a violation of Delaware law.

         5.3 Bank Merger. The Company and Purchaser intend to take all action
necessary and appropriate to cause to be entered into the Bank Merger Agreement,
substantially on the terms and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
"Bank Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Mid America and the Bank shall merge
simultaneously with or, if such Bank Merger cannot be effected simultaneously,
immediately after the consummation of the Merger.

         5.4 D&O Indemnification. (a) Purchaser hereby agrees to cause to be
maintained in effect for six (6) years after the Effective Time "tail coverage"
under the Company's and the Company Subsidiary's current policy of officers' and
directors' liability insurance with respect to actions and omissions occurring
on or prior to the Effective Date; provided, however, that Purchaser may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage amounts containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the covered persons
provided that such substitution shall not result in any lapses in coverage with
respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time; provided,
further, that Purchaser shall not be required to pay a premium amount in excess
of the maximum amount disclosed on Schedule 5.4(a) to the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule and if Purchaser is unable to obtain the insurance, Purchaser shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for a premium equal to such
maximum amount. Schedule 5.4(a) to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
copy of the Company's current D&O Insurance Policy, the current premium amount
paid by the Company to obtain such insurance and the period of coverage to which
such premium payment relates.

         (b) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, Purchaser and Mid America (each an "Indemnifying Party" and
together the "Indemnifying Parties") jointly and severally agree to indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is now or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, or trustee of any
benefit plan of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for unaffiliated
corporate trustees (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters involving the Company, and/or any Company
Subsidiary existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent to which the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary
is permitted or required by law or their respective Certificate of Incorporation
(or other chartering document) and By-laws to indemnify such Indemnified Parties
and in the manner to which it could indemnify such parties under the Certificate
of Incorporation (or other chartering document) and By-laws of such entity, in
each case as in effect on the date hereof, or under applicable law.

         (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 5.4(b), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the appropriate Indemnifying Party thereof.

the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to


                                     - 41 -

acceptable to such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection
with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to,
or fails to promptly and timely assume such defense, or to appropriately defend
such claim once assumed (except with respect to any settlement contemplated
below), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser to handle such defense and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses to all such counsel for an
Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction for an
Indemnified Party), and notwithstanding any assumption of such defense by the
Indemnifying Party, an Indemnified Party may retain counsel of its own choosing
to monitor such defense (with the Indemnified Party assuming any and all
expenses as a result of hiring such counsel); (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall

Purchaser on the date hereof a signed representation letter as to certain

best efforts to obtain and deliver to Purchaser a signed representation letter
substantially in the form of Exhibit D from any person who becomes an executive
officer or director of the Company or any stockholder who becomes such an

         5.6 Regulatory Applications. Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable,
file applications or notices with the applicable Governmental Authorities, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries received concerning said applications; provided,
however, that Purchaser shall have no obligation to accept nonstandard
conditions or restrictions with respect to the aforesaid approvals of
Governmental Authorities if it shall reasonably determine that such conditions
or restrictions would have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or would be
materially burdensome to Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. In the event of an adverse or unfavorable determination by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the requisite approvals of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in the event the Merger is
challenged or opposed by any administrative or legal proceeding, whether by the
United States Department of Justice or otherwise, the determination of whether
and to what extent to seek appeal or review, administrative or otherwise, or
other appropriate remedies shall be made by Purchaser after consultation with

issued to holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger, which Registration
Statement shall include the Proxy Statement for use in soliciting proxies for
the special meeting of stockholders (the "Stockholders' Meeting") to be held by
the Company for purposes of considering this Agreement, and Purchaser and the
Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration

reasonable action required to be taken, if any, under the applicable blue sky or
securities laws in connection with the issuance of the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock in the Merger. Each party shall furnish all information concerning
it and the holders of its capital stock as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement and Proxy Statement and related actions. The Company shall call the
Stockholders' Meeting to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the
effective date of the Registration Statement for the purpose of voting upon this
Agreement and the Merger. In connection with the Stockholders' Meeting, (a)
Purchaser and the Company shall jointly prepare the Proxy Statement as part of
the Registration Statement, and the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to
its stockholders, on a date mutually acceptable to the parties hereto (the
"Mailing Date"); (b) the Board of Directors of the Company shall, subject to the
exercise of its fiduciary duties, unanimously recommend to its stockholders the
adoption of this Agreement, and (c) the Board of Directors of the Company shall

         5.9 Notice. At all times prior to the Effective Time, each party shall
give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence or its knowledge of any event
or condition that would cause any of its representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement not to be true and correct in all material respects as of the
date of this Agreement or as of the Effective Time, or any of its


                                     - 43 -
<PAGE>

obligations set forth in this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to
the Effective Time not to be performed in all material respects at or prior to
the Effective Time, including without limitation, any event, condition, change
or occurrence which individually, or in the aggregate with any other events,
conditions or changes that have occurred after the date hereof, so far as
reasonably can be foreseen at the time of the occurrence, or thereafter, is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. After receipt of any such notice
disclosing a material breach, the nondisclosing party may, within five (5)
business days thereof, notify the disclosing party of its intent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d); provided, however, that the
disclosing party shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30)
days thereof but no later than the Effective Time. In the event the
nondisclosing party fails to notify the disclosing party of its intent to
terminate within five (5) business days after receipt of any notice hereunder,
the nondisclosing party shall be deemed to have waived its right of termination
as to any such breach arising out of or with respect to the events, conditions,
change or occurrence described in such notice; provided, however, that any
particular breach that is deemed to have been waived by the nondisclosing party
may thereafter be considered by the nondisclosing party in determining the
aggregate contribution of all events, conditions, changes and occurrences
described by the disclosing party pursuant to this Section 5.9 toward the
occurrence of a material breach by the disclosing party.

         5.10 Press Releases. Purchaser and the Company shall coordinate all
publicity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
except as otherwise required by law, or with respect to employee meetings,
neither party shall issue any press release, publicity statement or other public
notice relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
without obtaining the prior consent of the other, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Company shall obtain the prior consent of Purchaser
to the content of any communication to its stockholders which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         5.11 Delivery of Supplements to Disclosure Schedules. Five (5) business
days prior to the Effective Time, the Company will supplement or amend the
Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising which,
if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedule or which
is necessary to correct any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in
any representation and warranty made by the disclosing party which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby. For purposes of determining the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article III hereof
and in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Article
VI hereof as of the Effective Time, the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to include only the information contained therein on the date hereof and
any information previously disclosed by the Company pursuant to Section 5.9 as
to which Purchaser is deemed to have waived its right of termination; provided,
however, that delivery of such supplements containing information which causes
any representation or warranty of the Company to be false or materially
misleading will not cure any breach hereunder of such representations or
warranties.

         5.12 Tax Opinion. Purchaser shall obtain a written opinion ("Tax
Opinion") of Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz, P.C. addressed to Purchaser,
dated the Closing Date,


                                     - 44 -
<PAGE>

subject to customary representations to be made by Purchaser and the Company
relating to the Merger and the Bank Merger and assumptions referred to therein,
and substantially to the effect that (a) the Merger will constitute a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Purchaser
and the Company will each be a party to such reorganization; (b) the exchange in
the Merger of Purchaser Common Stock and cash for Company Common Stock will not
give rise to the recognition of any income, gain or loss to Purchaser, the
Company, or the stockholders of the Company with respect to such exchange
except, with respect to the stockholders of the Company, to the extent of any
Cash Consideration received in the Merger and any cash received in lieu of
fractional shares; (c) the adjusted tax basis of the Purchaser Common Stock
received by Company stockholders in the Merger will equal the adjusted tax basis
of the Company Common Stock exchanged therefor decreased by the amount of money
received in the exchange and increased by the amount of gain recognized in the
exchange; (d) the holding period of the Purchaser Common Stock received in the
Merger will include the period during which the shares of Company Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefor were held, provided such shares of Company
Common Stock were held as a capital asset at the Effective Time; (e) the
adjusted tax basis of the assets of the Company in the hands of Purchaser will
be the same as the adjusted tax basis of such assets in the hands of the Company
immediately prior to the exchange; and (f) the holding period of the assets of
the Company transferred to Purchaser will include the period during which such
assets were held by the Company prior to the exchange.

         5.13 Tax Treatment. Neither the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
Purchaser, the Purchaser Subsidiaries, nor any of their affiliates, shall
voluntarily take any action which would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. In addition, Purchaser
and the Company agree to take any and all necessary or advisable steps to
restructure or modify the terms of the transaction contemplated hereby, if such
steps are necessary or advisable to qualify the transaction contemplated hereby
as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code; provided,
however, nothing contained in this Section 5.13 shall be deemed to require
Purchaser to take any steps which will alter the Merger Consideration provided
for in Section 1.5.

         5.14 Resolution of Company Benefit Plans. The Company and Purchaser
shall cooperate in effecting the following treatment of the Company Benefit
Plans, except as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Company prior to the
Effective Time:

         (a) At the Effective Time, Purchaser (or a Purchaser Subsidiary) shall
be substituted for the Company as the sponsoring employer under those Company
Benefit Plans with respect to which the Company or the Bank is a sponsoring
employer immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall assume and be vested
with all of the powers, rights, duties, obligations and liabilities previously
vested in the Company or the Bank with respect to each such plan. Except as
otherwise provided herein, each such plan and any Company Benefit Plan sponsored
by the Company or the Bank shall be continued in effect by Purchaser or any
applicable Purchaser Subsidiary after the Effective Time without a termination
or discontinuance thereof as a result of the Merger, subject to the power
reserved to Purchaser or any applicable Purchaser Subsidiary under each such
plan to subsequently amend or terminate the plan, which amendments or
terminations shall comply with applicable law. The Company, the Bank and
Purchaser will use all reasonable efforts (i) to effect said substitutions and
assumptions, and take


                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>

such other actions contemplated under this Agreement, and (ii) to amend such
plans as to the extent necessary to provide for said substitutions and
assumptions, and such other actions contemplated under this Agreement.

         (b) Except as contemplated in any Letter of Understanding discussed
below, at or as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, as Purchaser
shall reasonably determine, Purchaser shall provide, or cause any Purchaser
Subsidiary to provide, to each employee of the Company and the Bank as of the
Effective Time ("Company Employees") the opportunity to participate in each
employee benefit plan and program maintained by Purchaser or the Purchaser
Subsidiaries for similarly situated employees (the "Purchaser Benefit Plans");
provided, however, that with respect to such Purchaser Benefit Plans, Company
Employees shall be given credit for service with the Company or the Bank in
determining eligibility for and vesting in benefits thereunder, but not for
purposes of benefit accrual; provided, further that Company Employees shall not
be subject to any waiting periods or pre-existing condition exclusions under the
Purchaser Benefit Plans to the extent that such periods are longer or
restrictions impose a greater limitation than the periods or limitations imposed
under the Company Benefit Plans; provided, further, that to the extent that the
initial period of coverage for Company Employees under any Purchaser Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA is not a full 12-month period of coverage, Company Employees shall be
given credit under the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plans for any deductibles
and co-insurance payments made by such Company Employees under the Company
Benefit Plans during the balance of such 12-month period of coverage. Nothing in
the preceding sentence shall obligate Purchaser to provide or cause to be
provided any benefits duplicative of those provided under any Company Benefit
Plan continued pursuant to subparagraph (a) above, including, but not limited
to, extending participation in any Purchaser Benefit Plan which is an "employee
pension benefit plan" under ERISA with respect to any year during which
allocations are made to Company Employees under the Company ESOP or the Company
401(k) Plan. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the power of
Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary to amend or terminate any benefit plan or
program, including any Company Benefit Plan, shall not be altered or affected.
Moreover, this Agreement shall not confer upon any Company Employee any rights
or remedies hereunder and shall not constitute a contract of employment or
create the rights, to be retained or otherwise, in employment with Purchaser or
any Purchaser Subsidiary.

         (c) Concurrently with or immediately after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain from each officer of
the Company who is a party to an employment agreement, change in control
agreement, supplemental executive retirement agreement or plan with the Company
or the Bank a Letter of Understanding with the Company and the Bank
substantially in the form heretofore provided (the "Letters of Understanding"),
addressing certain matters pertaining to such executive's employment agreement,
change in control agreement, supplemental executive retirement agreement or plan
and benefits payable thereunder, and where applicable, such executive's
employment after the Effective Time.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all
retention, severance, covenant not to compete, termination payments,
acceleration of benefit vesting, and other compensation paid by the Company or
the Bank, or as provided for in this Agreement, any Letter of Understanding, any
Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, including, but not limited to,


                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>

any Change in Control Benefit, shall not violate any prohibitions which are
imposed by any Governmental Authorities, or which any Governmental Authorities
otherwise deem to constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices or
unreasonable compensation giving effect to any obligations of Purchaser or the
Purchaser Subsidiary as provided herein or in any Letter of Understanding.

         (e) At the Effective Time, the ESOP shall have been amended to provide
that no further contributions shall be made thereto, all accounts thereunder
shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable and the Purchaser Common Stock issued
upon the conversion of the Company Common Stock in the Merger shall become the
qualifying employee security for purposes of the ESOP. On or as soon as is
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the loan balance in the ESOP
shall be paid in full by the ESOP (from the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration relating to the unallocated ESOP shares, to the extent thereof,
and thereafter from the stock portion of the Merger Consideration relating to
the unallocated ESOP shares) and any remaining unallocated amounts shall be
allocated as of the Effective Time to participants pro rata as earnings of the
ESOP, based on the balances of participants' accounts immediately prior to such
allocation. Purchaser shall cause the ESOP to be merged into Purchaser's
employee stock ownership plan in compliance with Section 414(l) of the Code.

         (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate its
Employee Severance Compensation Plan as set forth in the letter agreement of
even date herewith between Purchaser and the Company.

         (g) Purchaser and the Company agree to take certain other actions with
respect to the Company Benefit Plans as set forth in the letter agreement of
even date herewith between Purchaser and the Company.

         (h) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company
Stock Option with respect to which the holder thereof has timely delivered a
Conversion Agreement pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) hereof shall be assumed by
Purchaser as provided in the Conversion Agreement.

         (i) Purchaser shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance at all times after the Effective Time a sufficient number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options
assumed by Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.3(a)(i). Immediately following
the Effective Time, Purchaser shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding.

         5.15 Appointment to Purchaser Board of Directors. Purchaser shall, as
of the Effective Time, cause Leo Flanagan to be appointed: (i) to the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the Board of Directors of Mid
America; provided, however, that Mr. Flanagan shall qualify as an independent
director of Purchaser under applicable Nasdaq rules.


                                     - 47 -

         5.16 Advisory Board. Purchaser shall cause Mid America to create an
advisory board (the "Advisory Board") to (a) assist in and advise with respect
to integration of the operations of the Bank with and into those of Mid America,
and (b) advise with respect to the operations of Mid America. Other than the
director identified in Section 5.15 above, Mid America will invite all current
members of the Board of Directors of the Company who are members of such Board
of Directors as of the Effective Time to serve on the Advisory Board, each of
whom shall be entitled to receive per meeting fees (without reimbursement for
travel expenses) equal to the per meeting fee currently paid by Mid America to
each of its directors, which amount is set forth on Schedule 5.16 to the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule; provided, that the Advisory Board shall meet at
least quarterly, and may meet more frequently at the request of Purchaser. The
Board of Directors of Purchaser shall review the Advisory Board function
annually to consider its continuation.

         5.17 Environmental Investigation. (a) Purchaser may engage a mutually
acceptable environmental consultant to conduct a preliminary ("Phase I")
environmental assessment of each of the parcels of owned real estate used in the
operation of the businesses of the Company, the Bank or any Company Subsidiary
or Tax Subsidiary and any other real estate owned by the Company, the Bank or
any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary. The fees and expenses of the
consultant with respect to the Phase I assessments shall be paid by Purchaser or
Mid America. The Company shall fully cooperate with Purchaser to provide the
consultant reasonable access to the premises under assessment. The consultant
shall complete and deliver the Phase I assessments not later than sixty (60)
days after the date of this Agreement. If any environmental conditions are found
or suspected or would tend to be indicated by the report of the consultant which
may be contrary to the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
herein, without regard to any knowledge qualifiers or exceptions that may be
contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule, then the parties shall obtain from
one or more mutually acceptable consultants or contractors, as appropriate, an
estimate of the cost of any further environmental investigation, sampling,
analysis, remediation, or other follow-up work that may be necessary to address
those conditions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

         (b) Upon receipt of the estimate of the costs of all follow-up work to
the Phase I assessments or any subsequent investigation phases that may be
conducted, the parties shall mutually determine a course of action for further
investigation and remediation of any environmental condition suspected, found to
exist, or that would tend to be indicated by the report of the consultant. All
post-Phase I investigations or assessments (the cost of which shall be paid by
Purchaser), all work plans for any post-Phase I assessments or remediation and
any removal or remediation actions that may be performed shall be satisfactory
to Purchaser subject to the consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld). The Company shall act promptly to complete, at its cost,
all work plans for any post-Phase I assessments or remediation and any removal
or remediation actions. If the work plans or removal or remediation actions cost
more than $500,000 (individually or in the aggregate) to complete, Purchaser and
the Company agree that the cost of the work plans, removal and remediation
actions shall be deducted from the cash portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration due under the Agreement and each component of the Merger
Consideration, and the Cash Conversion Number and Stock Conversion Number, shall
be adjusted proportionately.

         5.18 Title to Real Estate. As soon as practical after the date hereof,
but in any event no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, the
Company, at its own expense, shall obtain and deliver to Purchaser, with respect
to all real estate owned or held pursuant to a ground lease by the Company, or
any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary, either (i) an owner's preliminary
report of title covering a date subsequent to the date hereof, issued by Chicago
Title Insurance Company or such other title insurance company accepted by
Purchaser (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld), showing fee simple
title in the Company or such Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary, in such real
estate or the appropriate leasehold interest of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary, subject only to (A) the standard exceptions to
title customarily contained in a policy on ALTA 1970 Owner's Form B; (B) liens
of current state and local property taxes which are not delinquent or subject to
penalty; and (C) liens and encumbrances as disclosed on Schedule 3.25(a) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and restrictions and conditions of record that do
not materially adversely affect the value or use of such real estate, or (ii) a
commitment by the title insurance company currently insuring Company or Company
Subsidiary's or Tax Subsidiary's title to the real estate owned or held pursuant
to a ground lease to provide an endorsement to the current title policies
changing the name of the insured to Purchaser at Closing; provided, however, (a)
such commitments and title policies are subject only to the matters set forth in
this Section 5.18; and (b) the effective date of such endorsement shall be
subsequent to or contemporaneous with the Effective Time.

         5.19 Cooperation. Subject to applicable law and regulation and after
receipt of stockholder approval and all required regulatory approvals, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall at such times as are reasonably
requested by Purchaser prior to Closing (i) consult and cooperate with Purchaser
with respect to conforming the loan, classification, accrual and reserve
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to those policies of
Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, and (ii) establish and take such
accruals, reserves and changes to conform the loan, accrual and reserves
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the differing policies
of Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries and to implement the same; provided,
however, that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to
take any such action that is not consistent with GAAP.

         5.20 Disclosure Controls. (a) Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the Company shall maintain disclosure controls and
procedures that are effective to ensure that material information relating to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is made known to the President and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to permit the
Company to record, process, summarize and report financial data in a timely and
accurate manner; (ii) such officers shall promptly disclose to the Company's
auditors and audit committee any significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, any material
weaknesses identified in internal controls, and any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls; and (iii) the Company shall take
appropriate corrective actions to address any such significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses identified in the internal controls.

         (b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Company
shall, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, permit Purchaser (a)
to meet with the officers of the Company and any Company Subsidiary responsible
for the financial


                                     - 49 -

statements of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and the internal control
over financial reporting of the Company and each Company Subsidiary to discuss
such matters as Purchaser may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate
concerning Purchaser's obligations under Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (b) to meet with officers of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to discuss the integration of appropriate disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting relating to the
Company's and each Company Subsidiary's operations with the controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting of Purchaser for
purposes of assisting Purchaser in compliance with the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act following the Effective Time. The Company shall, and
shall cause its and each Company Subsidiary's respective employees and
accountants to, fully cooperate with Purchaser in the preparation,
documentation, review, testing and all other actions Purchaser deems reasonably
necessary to satisfy the internal control certification requirements of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

                                      VI.

representation or warranty (other than the representations contained in Sections
3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4(a), 3.4(b) and 3.4(d)) is not true or correct as of the
Effective Time, the condition in this clause (ii) shall nonetheless be deemed
satisfied unless the facts or circumstances causing any representation or
warranty not to be true or correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and
without giving effect to any materiality qualifier set forth in any such
representation or warranty, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) The Company shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations and shall have complied in all material respects with all agreements
and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it
prior to or at the Effective Time.

been any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Federal or state
government or governmental agency or instrumentality or court, which would

Subsidiary, as the case may be, is a party requires the consent of, waiver from,

opinion of Purchaser, have or are likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, nor shall any director or officer or former director or officer of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary be made a party to, or threatened by, any
actions, suits, proceedings, litigation or legal proceedings relating to the
performance or nonperformance of their legal or fiduciary duties as directors
and officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary which in the reasonable
opinion of Purchaser is likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
action, suit, proceeding or claim shall have been instituted, made or threatened

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement which
would make consummation of the Merger inadvisable in the reasonable opinion of

made at and as of the Effective Time, provided, however, that if any
representation or warranty (other than the representations contained in Sections

                         TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

         7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time:

         (a) By mutual written consent of the Board of Directors of Purchaser
and the Board of Directors of the Company.

         (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Purchaser or the
Company if there shall have been a final judicial or regulatory determination
(as to which all periods for appeal shall have expired and no appeal shall be
pending) that any material provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable (unless the enforcement thereof is waived by the affected party)
or denying any regulatory application, the approval of which is a condition
precedent to either party's obligations hereunder.

         (c) By either party at any time after the stockholders of the Company
fail to approve this Agreement and the Merger in a vote taken at a meeting duly
convened for that purpose; provided, however, the Company shall have no right to
terminate pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the Company has taken any action,
or failed to take any action, as applicable, as prescribed by Section 7.2(a)(i),
(ii) or (iii).


                                     - 53 -

         (d) By Purchaser or the Company in the event of the material breach by
the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein or in any schedule or document delivered pursuant hereto, which breach
would result in the failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
Section 6.2 hereof, in the case of Purchaser, or Section 6.3 hereof, in the case
of the Company, except in each case, for any such breach which has been
disclosed pursuant to Section 5.9 and waived by the non-disclosing party
pursuant to Section 5.9 or cured by the disclosing party prior to the Effective
Time and within the time period specified in Section 5.9.

         (e) By either party on or after March 31, 2006, in the event the Merger
has not been consummated by such date (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein).

         (f) By the Company, if (i) the Company has complied with the provisions
of Section 4.3, (ii) any corporation, partnership, person, other entity or
group, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act (other than Purchaser or any
affiliate of Purchaser), shall have commenced, made or proposed an Acquisition
Transaction, (iii) the Company's Board of Directors shall have determined, in
its good faith judgment, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors, that such offer is more favorable to the Company's stockholders than
the Reorganization (as defined below), and (iv) the Company's Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that if it failed to recommend such offer
or accept such proposal then such failure would be determined to result in a
breach of the directors' fiduciary duties (a "Superior Proposal"); provided,
however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(f) until the expiration of five (5) business days after written
notice of any such offer or proposal referenced in this Section 7.1(f) has been
delivered to Purchaser, together with a summary of the terms and conditions of
any such offer or proposal (and including a copy thereof with all accompanying
documentation, if in writing). After providing such notice, the Company shall
provide a reasonable opportunity to Purchaser during the five-day period to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
the Company to proceed with the Merger on such adjusted terms.

         (g) By the Board of Directors of Purchaser if the Company has received
a Superior Proposal, and the Board of Directors of the Company has entered into
an acquisition agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal, terminated this
Agreement, or withdraws, modifies or amends in any respect adverse to Purchaser
its approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or
withdraws or fails to make a unanimous recommendation that stockholders of the
Company vote in favor of the Merger, or modifies or qualifies such
recommendation in a manner adverse to Purchaser, or the Board of Directors of
the Company has resolved to do any of the foregoing.

         7.2 Termination Fee. (a) In consideration of the expenses and forgone
opportunities of Purchaser, as a condition and inducement to Purchaser's
willingness to enter into and perform this Agreement, provided that the Company
has not validly terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), the
Company shall pay to Purchaser immediately upon demand a fee of $9,000,000 (the
"Termination Fee") upon the earliest to occur of the following:

<PAGE>

                  (i) Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
         7.1(c) or (d) and (A) the Board of Directors of the Company (1) shall
         have withdrawn, modified or amended in any respect its approval or

         7.4 Survival of Agreements. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Purchaser or the Company as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, except that (i) the
agreements contained in Sections 5.1(b), 5.10, 7.2 and 7.3 hereof shall survive
the termination hereof; and (ii) a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d) hereof
shall not relieve a breaching party from any liability for any breach giving
rise to such termination.

         7.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors at any time before or after
approval hereof by the stockholders of the Company but, after such approval, no
amendment shall be made which changes the form of consideration or adversely
affects or decreases the value of the consideration to be received by the
stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders or
which in any other way adversely affects the rights of the stockholders of the
Company without the further required approval of the stockholders so affected.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. Purchaser and the Company may, without
approval of their respective Boards of Directors, make such technical changes to
this Agreement, not inconsistent with the purposes hereof and thereof, as may be
required to effect or facilitate any governmental approval or acceptance of the
Merger or of this Agreement or to effect or facilitate any filing or recording
required for the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         7.6 Waiver. Any term, provision or condition of this Agreement (other
than requirements for stockholder approval and required approvals of the
Governmental Authorities) may be waived in writing at any time by the party
which is entitled to the benefits hereof. Each and every right granted to any
party hereunder, or under any other document delivered in connection herewith or
therewith, and each and every right allowed it by law or equity, shall be
cumulative and may be exercised from time to time. The failure of either party
at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no
manner affect such party's right at a later time to enforce the same, except as
provided in Section 5.9. No waiver by any party of a condition or of the breach
of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach or a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty of this Agreement. No investigation, review
or audit by Purchaser of the Company or the Company of Purchaser prior to or
after the date hereof shall estop or prevent either party from exercising any
right hereunder or be deemed to be a waiver of any such right.

                                     VIII.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

set forth herein which are contemplated to be performed after the Effective
Time) shall not survive the Effective Time, except as provided for in Section
7.4.
