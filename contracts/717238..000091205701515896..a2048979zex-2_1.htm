AES Acquisition Corp. and Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") which provides for the merger (the "Merger") of
Company with and into AES Acquisition Corp. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently
with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Dassault Systemes of America Corp. ("DSA") are entering into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Agreement")

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
