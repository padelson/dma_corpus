       |   | 11.1.  
---|---|--- 
     

       | 11.1.1.  |   | Following Completion, the Seller will

with the Buyers in relation to such matter and, where possible, offering the
Buyer the opportunity to join the proceedings.   

       | 11.1.2.  |   | The Seller and the Buyers will, in good
faith, consider any settlement opportunities relating to the proceedings and,

interests of both the Seller and the Buyers.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | 11.1.3.  |   | In connection with Sellers activities to
oppose such CSIRO Patents and CSH Patent, Seller shall keep the Buyers

respect to or by reason of the infringement or misappropriation of such CSIRO
Patents by the Sellers or any member of the Target Group in the conduct of
the Business prior to the Completion Date including any adverse decision of
such opposition proceedings relating to the period prior to Completion.  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     11.2.  |   | In the event that it is discovered after Completion
that (i) the Dutch Assets transferred in accordance with the Dutch Deed of
Transfer or this Agreement, the Dutch Contracts or Dutch Records do not
provide the Dutch Buyer with the benefit or use of or access to any assets
or records directly relating to the Dutch Business and necessary to enable
the Dutch Buyer to conduct the Dutch Business other than assets or records
which are allocated into the RandD; business owned and jointly utilised
category referred to in clause 11.22(d); or (ii) the Target Group does not
have the use of or access to all of the assets directly relating to
and reasonably necessary to enable the Target Group to conduct the Business
carried on by them other than assets or records which are allocated into the
RandD; business owned and jointly utilised category referred to in clause
11.22(d), then the Sellers shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that
these assets and records are transferred to the Dutch Buyer or the UK Buyer
as appropriate as soon as reasonably practicable and free of charge.  
---|---|--- 
     

     11.3.  |   | The Seller shall procure that following Completion
the Buyers, at their own expense, are provided with such access and

     11.4.  |   | Conditional upon and with effect from Completion, the

Target Group from all agreements and arrangements which are
exclusively between member(s) of the Target Group and member(s) of the
Retained Group (and not for the avoidance of doubt any third parties) except
to the extent such agreements or arrangements relate to the operation of the
Services Division in the ordinary course or have been or are to be entered
into pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
     

     11.5.  |   | Insofar as either of the Sellers, or any other member
of the Retained Group, remains a party to any contract or agreement to which
a member of the Target Group and any third party are also a party (a
"Relevant Joint Contract") the parties shall work together in the
period between the date of this Agreement and Completion to identify the
Relevant Joint Contracts and, acting in good faith, to agree whether any
steps need to be taken in relation to such contracts and, if so, which
member(s) of the Target Group and/or member(s) of the Retained Group, as the
case may be, should assume and/or retain the rights and obligations under
such Relevant Joint Contract. The Buyers and the Sellers confirm their
understanding that any such allocation should in principle be determined on
the basis that any Relevant Joint Contract which principally relates to the
operations of the Services Division should be allocated to a member of the
Target Group (a "Target Group Relevant Joint Contract") and that any
Relevant Joint Contract which principally relates to the operations of the
Retained Group should be allocated to the relevant member of the Retained
Group (a "Retained Group Relevant Joint Contract"). It is further
acknowledged that certain Relevant Joint Contracts may not require allocation
or change or may require to be split into separate contracts or otherwise
modified to give similar effect.

Relevant Joint Contract and (without limitation) shall provide access to all

---|---|---|--- 
     

     11.10.  |   | Nothing in clauses 11.9.5 and 11.9.6 shall operate

---|---|--- 
     

     11.11.  |   | The covenants in clause 11.9 are intended for the

the Target Group and apply to actions carried out by the Sellers or any
member of the Sellers Group in any capacity (including as
shareholder, partner, director, principal, consultant, officer, agent or
otherwise) and whether directly or indirectly, on its own behalf or on behalf
of, or jointly with, any other person.  
---|---|---

---|---|--- 
     

       | 11.12.1.  |   | notwithstanding the provisions of clause

       | 11.12.2.  |   | carrying on the Sellers Business; and

to, enter into a contract for the services of, or otherwise entice or attempt
to entice away from the Sellers or any member of the Sellers Group, any
Restricted Seller Person in either case, other than by means of an
advertising campaign open to all comers and not specifically targeted at any
Restricted Seller Persons.  
---|---|--- 
     

     11.14.  |   | Each of the covenants in clause 11.9 is a separate
undertaking by the Sellers and shall be enforceable by the Buyers and each
member of the Target Group separately and independently of their right to
enforce any one or more of the other covenants contained in that clause.  
---|---|--- 
     

     11.15.  |   | The parties acknowledge that the Sellers have
confidential information relating to the Business and that the Buyers are

---|---|--- 
     

     11.19.  |   | Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies
that the parties may have, each party acknowledges and agrees that damages
alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the terms of clause
11 or clause 11.20 by the other party. Accordingly, the parties shall
be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of the terms of clause
11 or clause 11.20 of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
     

     11.20.  |   | The parties hereby undertake in the period between

period of time not exceeding 60 days in which to evaluate Fidelta and/or the
part of the Fidelta Business and to decide whether it wishes to make an offer
for the relevant shares in Fidelta or the relevant part of the Fidelta
Business (as applicable) (the "Right of First Refusal"). The Seller
shall provide the Buyer with such information as it may reasonably request to
make such evaluation and decide whether it wishes to exercise its Right of
First Refusal.  
---|---|--- 
     

     11.22.  |   | The Buyers and the Sellers shall work together in
good faith in the period between the date of this Agreement and Completion to
agree a schedule allocating the assets of the Dutch Seller into the following

---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (b)  |   | Services Business owned and jointly utilised;

the event that following such allocation there are assets allocated into
categories (a) and (b) which are not listed in Schedule 11 to this Agreement
the Buyers and the Sellers agree, prior to Completion, to amend Schedule 11
accordingly and to take such other steps as may be required to procure that
the ownership of such assets is transferred to the Dutch Seller with effect
from Completion.

party making a disclosure under this clause 12.4.1 shall, at all times, be
liable for the failure of its recipients to comply with the obligations set

VAT Implementation Decree 1968 ( _Uitvoeringsbeschikking Omzetbelasting 1968_
) apply to the transfer of each of the Dutch Assets, the Dutch Lease, the
Dutch Contracts and the Dutch Records under the contemplated Transaction, as
the Dutch Business qualifies as a separate enterprise which is transferred as
a going concern. Sellers shall, prior to Completion, request the
competent Dutch Tax authority to confirm this and Buyers shall fully
cooperate and provide information, if necessary, in respect of this
request.  
---|---|---

the Dutch Records under this Agreement, Buyers shall, upon receipt of a valid
tax invoice issued by the relevant Seller, pay the amount of Dutch VAT due in
relation to these transferred Dutch Assets, Dutch Lease, Dutch Contracts and
Dutch Records. All books, records, administration and other data and
documents relating to Dutch VAT due or paid in respect of the Dutch Assets,
the Dutch Lease, the Dutch Contracts or the Dutch Records shall be properly
stored by Sellers for the minimum statutory term as applicable under
the applicable (Dutch) VAT laws. Copies of such books, records,
administration and other data and documents will be made available to Buyers
upon first request.

---|---|--- 
     

     25.1.  |   | This Agreement may be executed in any number of
