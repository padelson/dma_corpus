on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and wishing to be legally bound thereby, the parties, intending
to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

  

# ARTICLE I

  

# PURCHASE AND SALE

  

## Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, (a) Sellers hereby
agree to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer hereby agrees
to purchase from Sellers, (i) all of the Shares, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, and (ii) all of the Additional Assets, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances, and (b) Buyer hereby agrees
to assume the Assumed Liabilities.

  

## Section 1.2 _Closing Payment Amount_. The consideration payable by Buyer
for the purchase of the Shares and the Additional Assets is One Hundred
Twenty-Three Million Dollars ($123,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "). On
the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price to Sellers by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_
hereto. The Purchase Price is subject to adjustment as provided in Section
1.3 below.

  

## Section 1.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  

### (a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted after the Closing by adding the
Net Working Capital Excess, or deducting the Net Working Capital Shortfall,
if any. As used herein, the following terms shall have the definitions set
forth below:

  

#### (i) The term " _Net Working Capital Shortfall_ " shall mean the amount,
if any, by which the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.3(c) below, is less than the Target Net Working
Capital.

        

#### (ii) The term " _Net Working Capital Excess_ " shall mean the amount, if
any, by which the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant
to Section 1.3(c) below, is more than the Target Net Working Capital.

  

#### (iii) The term " _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean the positive or
negative difference between the Current Assets of the Business (as defined in
_Schedule 1.3_ hereto) _minus_  the Current Liabilities of the Business (as
defined in _Schedule 1.3_  hereto).

  

#### (iv) The term " _Closing Net Working Capital_ " shall mean the Net
Working Capital of the Business as of the close of business Pacific Time on
the Closing Date.

  

#### (v) The term " _Target Net Working Capital_ " shall mean negative
Twenty-Three Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars (-$23,400,000).

  

### (b) Within sixty (60) calendar days of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative an unaudited combined
balance sheet of the Business as of the close of business Pacific Time on the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and shall include a
preliminary unaudited statement of the Closing Net Working Capital (the "
_Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall
(x) fairly present the Current Assets and Current Liabilities of the Business
as of the close of business Pacific Time on the Closing Date in accordance
with Seller Accounting Principles applied in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined), as further
set forth in Section 2.5 below and _Schedule 1.3_.  The Closing Net Working
Capital shall be calculated in the manner described on _Schedule 1.3_ hereto
based upon amounts reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet but shall take into
account the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents and the elimination of
Intercompany Balances in the manner contemplated in Section 4.12 below.

  

### (c) The Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i)
the date the Seller Representative notifies Buyer of its acceptance of the
Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital or
(ii) the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following the Seller RepresentativeÂ’s
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, unless the Seller Representative
notifies Buyer in writing prior to such date of its disagreement with any
aspect of the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). The Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any such disagreement,
including the Seller RepresentativeÂ’s own calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer within thirty (30)
calendar days of the Seller RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement, then (x) the Closing Net Working Capital amount
shall become final and binding only upon the earlier of (A) the date that
Buyer and the Seller Representative resolve in writing any differences they
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, or
(B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved through accounting
arbitration pursuant to Section 1.3(d), and (y) the final and binding Closing
Net Working Capital amount shall be deemed to be the amount agreed to by
Buyer and the Seller Representative, or the resolution as determined by
accounting arbitration, as the case may be; _provided_  that in no event
shall Closing Net Working Capital be less than BuyerÂ’s calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement or
more than the Seller RepresentativeÂ’s calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital set forth on a Notice of Disagreement.

        

### (d) If a Notice of Disagreement shall be duly and timely delivered
pursuant to Section 1.3(c), Buyer and the Seller Representative shall, during
the thirty (30) days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith in
respect of the disputed items. If the Seller Representative and Buyer are
unable to resolve any such dispute during such period, the dispute shall be

its determination shall be final and conclusive as between the parties,
absent fraud or manifest error. All fees and expenses of the Independent
Firm shall be borne (i) by Buyer if the difference between the Closing Net
Working Capital (as determined by the Independent Firm) and BuyerÂ’s
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement is greater than the difference between the Closing
Net Working Capital (as determined by the Independent Firm) and the Seller
RepresentativeÂ’s calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement, (ii) by Sellers if the first such difference is
less than the second such difference, and (iii) otherwise equally by Buyer on
the one hand, and Sellers on the other hand.

  

### (e) Within ten (10) business days after the Closing Net Working Capital
amount becomes final and binding pursuant to Section 1.3(c), (i) if a Net
Working Capital Shortfall exists, the Seller Representative, on behalf of
Sellers, shall pay the Net Working Capital Shortfall to Buyer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by Buyer, or (ii) if a Net Working
Capital Excess exists, Buyer shall pay the Net Working Capital Excess to the
Seller Representative, for the benefit of Sellers, in immediately available

agreed by Sellers that such payment to the Seller Representative shall be
deemed to constitute payment to all Sellers hereunder.

authorized agent (the "Seller Representative") of the other Sellers for all
purposes under this Agreement, and all actions taken and decisions made by
the Seller Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall be fully binding

of the Sellers had taken such actions or made such decisions. In connection
with the foregoing, all notice, delivery, consent or consultation obligations
of Buyer with respect to Sellers shall be deemed satisfied by Buyer if such
notice, delivery, consent or consultation is provided to, or obtained from,
the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers.

now being conducted, except where failure to have such power and authority
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Business.  Each MDL Group

        

### Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the conduct of
its business as it is now conducted requires such qualification or licensing,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified, licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Business.  Sellers have heretofore delivered to Buyer true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of each MDL Group Company as currently in effect.

  

### (b) Each Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where failure to
be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Sellers.

  

### (c) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ "
means: (A) with respect to the Business, any change, event, circumstance,
effect or occurrence, individually or in the aggregate, which is or would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the assets
(including intangible assets), properties, liabilities, business, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Business, in each
case taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the determination of
Material Adverse Effect shall not include, either alone or in combination:
(i) any change, event, circumstance, effect or occurrence resulting from
the announcement of the execution of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, or BuyerÂ’s proposed ownership and operation

contractors; (ii) any changes (after the date hereof) in accounting policies
or practices or any Laws; (iii) any adverse change, event, circumstance,

the Business; (iv) the effect of any change arising in connection with
earthquakes, floods, other acts of God, hostilities, acts of war, sabotage or

except to the extent that the effect is material damage to a substantial

the MDL Group Companies to meet any of their internal projections, including
any projections previously made available to Buyer (it being understood that
the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure may be
deemed to constitute, in and of themselves, a Material Adverse Effect and may
be taken into account when determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred); or (vi) the effect of the divestiture of the MDL Group Companies
and the Additional Assets or the loss of the benefits of any of the Shared
Services or Master Services Agreements; and (B) with respect to Buyer or
Sellers, any change, event, circumstance, effect or occurrence, individually
or in the aggregate, which is or would reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the ability of such party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements.

Agreement and each of the other agreements delivered in connection herewith

the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller and MDL Group Company of this Agreement and the

        

## Collateral Agreements to which such Seller or MDL Group Company is a
party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, have been duly authorized by, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of, each Seller and MDL Group Company are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by such Seller or MDL Group Company of this Agreement
or the Collateral Agreements and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been (and the
Collateral Agreements will be) duly executed and delivered by each Seller and
MDL Group Company that is a party hereto and thereto and, assuming due and
valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Buyer, this
Agreement constitutes (and the Collateral Agreements, when executed and
delivered will constitute) the legal, valid and binding obligations of each
Seller and MDL Group Company, as applicable, enforceable against them in
accordance with their respective terms, except that (i) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditorsÂ’
rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive

of time or both) a default or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Material Contract or Lease; (iii) violate any material
order, writ, judgment, injunction or Laws applicable to any Seller or MDL

Group Company any filing or registration with, notification to, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any transnational, domestic or foreign
federal, state or local, court, arbitration, tribunal, commission,
legislative, executive or regulatory authority or agency (a " _Governmental
Entity_ "); or (v) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on
any Shares, Assets or Additional Assets, except for Permitted Encumbrances;
other than, in the case of clause (iv), any such filing or registration with,
notification to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Entity that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
effect on Sellers or the MDL Group Companies.

imposed under applicable securities Laws. No Seller is a party to any voting
trust or other contract with respect to the voting, redemption, sale,
transfer or other acquisition or disposition of the Shares, and no Seller has
granted any proxy, in whole or in part, with respect to the Shares. Other
than the Shares, there are no (i) equity securities of any class of  any MDL
Group Company, or any security exchangeable into or exercisable for such
equity securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding and (ii)
options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights or other Contracts
to which any MDL Group Company is a party or by which any MDL Group Company
is bound obligating a MDL Group Company to issue, exchange, transfer, deliver
or sell, or cause to be issued, exchanged, transferred, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the MDL
Group Company or any security or rights convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for any such shares or other equity interests, or obligating
the MDL Group Company to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, otherwise
modify or amend or enter into any such option, warrant, equity security,
call, right, or Contract. No Seller nor any MDL Group Company is party to
any arrangement granting to any Person any stock appreciation, phantom stock
or other similar right with respect to the Shares or the MDL Group Companies.
No applicable securities law was violated in connection with the offering,
sale or issuance of the Shares to any Seller or any of its Affiliates. None
of the Shares have been issued in violation of, and none are subject to, any
purchase option, call, right of first refusal, preemptive, subscription, or
other similar right.

## Section 4.4 _Employees, Wages and Benefits_.

  

### (a) _Post-Closing Employment_. On the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to
cause the MDL Group Companies to employ all Employees employed by an MDL
Group Company, or with respect to the Foreign Employees not employed by an
MDL Group Company, offer to employ each of such employees, with salaries,
annual target bonus amounts and benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation and benefits available to such Employees as
of the date hereof. Buyer further agrees, with respect to Foreign Employees

   

30  

  

### employed by an MDL Group Company, to cause the applicable MDL Group
Company to abide by existing contractual terms applicable to such Foreign
Employees as disclosed in  _Schedule 2.8(a)_. The Employees listed on
_Schedule 4.4(a)(i)_ as updated through the Closing Date to reflect the
termination of employment of any Domestic Employees or the hiring of any new
employees pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(iv), and the Foreign Employees listed on
_Schedule 4.4(a)(ii)_ as updated through the Closing Date to reflect the
termination of employment of any Foreign Employees or the hiring of any new
employees pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(iv), who accept offers of employment
from, and commence employment with, Buyer, are referred to herein as the "
_Transferred Employees_." Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Buyer in securing an acceptance of a Buyer offer of employment from
each of the individuals listed on _Schedules_ _4.4(a)(i)_ and _4.4(a)(ii)_.

  

### (b) _Employee Benefit Plans_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, effective as of the Closing Date, the participation of each Employee
and the spouse, former spouse, domestic partner, dependent and beneficiary of
any Employee, and all service credits and benefit accruals under the Employee
Benefit Plans with respect to any of such persons, shall cease. Transferred
Employees shall be given credit for all service with an MDL Group Company,
Sellers or SellersÂ’ Affiliates, as applicable, (or to any predecessors
thereof) under the applicable benefit plans of Buyer, for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and, as to welfare and benefit plans and
vacation benefits, benefits accrued in those employee benefit plans to the
same extent as such service was credited for such purpose under any of the
applicable Employee Benefit Plans, except that no such service shall be
required to be credited for purposes of determining benefit accruals under
any defined benefit plan. In addition, Buyer shall assume all accrued leave
entitlements. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
agreement of any applicable insurance carrier under the relevant insurance
contract for each welfare plan of Buyer in which the Transferred Employees
become participants, to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition, domestic partner or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect,
in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to
claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Employees
under similar plans maintained by the MDL Group Companies and its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, nothing herein shall require Buyer to employ any of the
Transferred Employees for any specified period of time following the Closing
Date. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.4(b)_ or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, Buyer acknowledges that none of the Employee Benefit Plans
will be transferred by Sellers or their Affiliates or made available to the
employees of the MDL Group Companies by Sellers or their Affiliates from and
after the Closing. Except as set forth in this Section 4.4, Sellers shall
retain all liabilities with respect to the Employee Benefit plans set forth
on _Schedule 4.4(b)_ after the Closing Date.

  

### (c) _401(k) Plans_. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall establish or designate a plan intended to qualify as a "cash or
deferred arrangement" within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). Each Transferred Employee (which employee shall be a
Domestic Employee) who is eligible to participate in the Reed Elsevier US
Salary Investment Plan (the " _Reed Elsevier 401(k) Plan_ ") immediately
prior to the Closing Date will become eligible to participate in the Buyer
401(k) Plan as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. As soon
as administratively practicable after the Closing Date, each Transferred
Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is a participant in the Reed Elsevier
401(k) Plan shall be

       

entitled to a distribution of his or her account balance in accordance with
the terms of the Reed Elsevier 401(k) Plan as in effect from time to time and
applicable Law, and Buyer shall take any and all action necessary to ensure
that the Buyer 401(k) Plan will accept asset rollovers, including "direct
rollovers" within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code (or similar
applicable Law) from the Reed Elsevier 401(k) Plan. Such rollovers shall,
to the extent permitted by the administrator of the Buyer 401(k) Plan (Buyer
being obligated to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such permission),
include the balance of any loans taken out by the Employee pursuant to the
Reed Elsevier 401(k) Plan. The parties will reasonably cooperate with each
other to take such actions (if any) as may be appropriate so that any
outstanding loans by Transferred Employees under the Reed Elsevier 401(k)
Plan as of the Closing Date do not become due and payable by such Transferred
Employees prior to the time at which such Transferred Employees are provided
an opportunity to elect a direct rollover of such Transferred EmployeesÂ’
account balances and loans under the Reed Elsevier 401(k) Plan to the Buyer
401(k) Plan.

  

### (d) _Employment Termination Liabilities; Severance_.  Following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the MDL Group Companies to assume and
discharge all liabilities and obligations for the provision of notice or
payment in lieu of notice or any applicable penalties under the WARN Act or
any similar state or local Law arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (e) _Retention Benefits_. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
be responsible for the payment of all amounts, including withholding
taxes, payable pursuant to the provisions of any retention agreement entered
into with any of the Transferred Employees by any Seller and listed on
_Schedule 4.4(e)(ii)_ (" _Retention Agreements_ "); provided, however that
Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any amount reflected on _Schedule
4.4(e)(ii)_  and labeled as either a (i) "Closing Retention Bonus" payable
upon a change of control, or (ii) a "2007 Bonus" together with any applicable
employer payroll taxes with respect to each such Closing Retention Bonus and
2007 Bonus.  Such reimbursement shall be made within thirty (30) days of the
Buyer providing Sellers with evidence of payment thereof and compliance with
the payment obligations under the Retention Agreements (including, without
limitation, a copy of the executed general release agreement with respect to
each Transferred Employee listed on _Schedule 4.4(e)(ii)_ , each of which
agreements shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Sellers). Buyer also
shall provide such other information as Sellers shall reasonably request in
order for Sellers to verify the payment of any such bonus and compliance with
the payment obligations under the Retention Agreements. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that SellersÂ’ reimbursement obligations shall not extend to any
amendments or changes to the Retention Agreements which increase the amounts
payable thereunder.

  

## Section 4.5 _UK Subject Employees_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof
to the contrary, the following provisions shall also apply following the
Closing Date with respect to any of the Transferred Employees who are
employed in, or otherwise subject to the Laws of, the United Kingdom (the "
_UK Subject Employees_ ").

       

#### (i) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall employ all UK Subject
Employees on terms including job titles and responsibilities, compensation,
pension, welfare and fringe benefits which are substantially equivalent to
the compensation, pension, welfare and fringe benefits available to the UK
Subject Employees as of the day preceding the Closing Date.

  

#### (ii) The parties acknowledge that the sale of the MDL Group Companies
and the Business constitutes the transfer of an undertaking for the purposes
of the Transfer Regulations (as such term is hereinafter defined) and
accordingly any contract of employment with a UK Subject Employee to which
the Transfer Regulations apply will have effect from the Closing as if
originally made between the UK Subject Employee and Buyer subject to the
terms of the relevant Transfer Regulations. As used herein, " _Transfer
Regulations_ " shall mean that Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 2006 or equivalent legislation implementing the
provisions of the Acquired Rights Directive (Council Directive 2001/23/EC)
which applies to any of the UK Subject Employees.

  

#### (iii) Buyer shall provide Sellers (or an Affiliate of Sellers, if such
entity is the employer of the applicable UK Subject Employee) with all

obligation to inform and consult with the UK Subject Employees, and shall
indemnify Sellers (and applicable Affiliate of Sellers) for any loss,
liability or costs it or they may incur in connection with its failure to do

approved for separate issuance by the parties. Buyer and Sellers shall not
issue any other press release or public announcement concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior
written approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the reasonable judgment of
Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, disclosure is otherwise required by
applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which
the securities of such party may be listed or traded; provided, that, to the
extent any such disclosure is required by applicable Law or the rules and

disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to content of
such disclosure.

  

## Section 4.7 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall, from time to time
after the Closing, without additional consideration, execute and deliver such

## Section 4.8 _Tax Matters_.

  

### (a) Buyer and Sellers shall each pay, in a due and timely manner, one-
half of all sales, use, value added, documentary, stamp duty, gross receipts,
registration, transfer, transfer gain, conveyance, excise, recording, license
and other similar taxes and fees, including any interest, penalties,
additions to tax or additional amounts in respect of the foregoing ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") arising out of or in connection with or attributable to
the transfer and sale of the Shares and the Additional Assets; provided,
however that Sellers shall pay all Transfer Taxes attributable to the
transfer of the Elsevier Retained Assets. Buyer and Sellers may agree in
writing that one party bears a specific Transfer Tax.  Sellers shall prepare
all returns in respect of Transfer Taxes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
such returns shall be delivered to Buyer no later than twenty (20) business
days before filing for approval by Buyer, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Sellers shall file all such returns.
 Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in connection with
their obligations under this Section 4.8(a).

  

### (b) Within four (4) months of the Closing, Buyer will provide to Sellers
an income tax package, including any items as Sellers may reasonably request
in writing within two (2) months of the Closing for the preparation of an
income Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Sellers will prepare, in a
manner consistent with past practice and at its own cost, all Tax Returns
with respect to the MDL Group Companies that (i) relate to an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group which includes both a
Seller and an MDL Group Company ("SellersÂ’ Consolidated Tax Returns") or (ii)
do not include any period after the Closing Date. Sellers shall deliver
copies of each such Pre-Closing Tax Return (and the portion of any such
SellersÂ’ Consolidated Tax Return relating to any of the MDL Group Companies)
to Buyer no later than twenty (20) calendar days before the due date for
filing for BuyerÂ’s review, comments and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, along with payment for any Tax due on such
Tax Return.  Buyer shall prepare and file in a due and timely basis all
other Straddle Period Tax Returns; provided, however, that Buyer shall
deliver to Sellers copies of such Tax Returns (other than any such Tax
Returns that are filed on a monthly basis) no later than twenty (20) calendar
days before filing for approval by Sellers, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Sellers shall pay Buyer the amount
representing the liability for Pre-Closing Taxes on such Tax Returns or any
Pre-Closing Tax Return promptly after such approval is given, but in no event
later than the due date for filing such Tax Returns. Buyer shall within
ten (10) business days provide copies of any Straddle Period Tax Return
filed, in each case together with proof of full payment of all liabilities
shown thereon and evidence of timely filing thereof.

  

Reed Elsevier US Holdings Inc. shall include the income of MDL US (including
any deferred items triggered into income by Reg. Â§1.1502-13 and any excess
loss account taken into income under Reg. Â§1.1502-19) on its consolidated
federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay
any federal income Taxes attributable to such income.

       

Sellers shall reasonably allow the applicable MDL Group Company and its
counsel to participate in the portion of any audit of any SellersÂ’
Consolidated Tax Return to the extent that such audit relates to such MDL
Group Company, and shall not settle any audit or other Tax proceedings of any
of its consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Returns to the extent
that such return relates to any MDL Group Company in a manner that would
adversely affect any MDL Group Company after the Closing without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

  

(c) As used in this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

  

(i) " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ " shall mean any Tax period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date and the portion of a Straddle Period ending as of the
close of business Pacific Time on the Closing Date.

  

(ii) " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_ " shall mean a Tax Return with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  

(iii) " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ " shall mean any Tax period beginning after
the Closing Date and the portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date.

  

(iv) The term " _Pre-Closing Taxes_ " means (i) all liability for Taxes of
any of the MDL Group Companies or with respect to the Additional Assets
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including for a Straddle Period, as allocated
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in accordance with Section 4.8(c)(v) below), (ii)
all liability resulting by reason of the liability of the MDL Group Companies
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state,
local or foreign Law or regulation, or by reason of an MDL Group Company
having been on or prior to the Closing Date a member of any affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group, or a party to any agreement or
arrangement, as a result of which liability of the MDL Group Company is
determined or taken into account with reference to the activities, assets or
other attributes of any other person or that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (iii) all liability for Taxes described in clause (iii) of the
definition of Tax and (iv) all liability for Taxes with respect to or arising
as a result of or in connection with the Elsevier Retained Assets or any
transfer or disposition thereof.

  

(v) " _Post-Closing Taxes_ " shall mean Taxes of the MDL Group Companies or
with respect to the Additional Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

  

(vi) " _Straddle Period_ " shall mean any Tax period that includes but does
not end on the Closing Date. With respect to any Straddle Period, Taxes
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period shall (x) in the case of any
Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or
related to income (including any real property taxes, personal property taxes
and similar _ad valorem_  obligations levied with respect to the Additional
Assets), be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that are in the Post-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period and
(y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross
receipts, sales or use Tax, be equal to the amount of Tax which would be
payable for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
Date if such portion were a complete Tax period and the Pre-Closing Tax
Period ended on and included the Closing Date (determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business Pacific Time on
the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the

       

taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which any
of the MDL Group Companies holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time)). All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the MDL Group Companies (unless otherwise
required by Law). All other Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period shall be
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  

(vii) " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ " shall mean a Tax Return filed with
respect to a Straddle Period.

  

### (d) Buyer shall not file any amended Tax Return for any period relating
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of Sellers,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### (e) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, none of Sellers, Affiliates of Sellers and
the MDL Group Companies shall, to the extent it relates to the MDL Group
Companies, make or change any Tax election, amend or change any Tax Return,
change any annual Tax accounting period, request a Tax ruling, adopt or
change any method of Tax accounting if any such action or omission would have
the effect of increasing the Tax liability of any MDL Group Company, Buyer or
any Affiliate of Buyer.

  

### (f) Sellers shall cause any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements with
respect to or involving any of the MDL Group Companies to be terminated as of
the Closing, such that after the Closing, none of the MDL Group Companies
shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

  

### (g) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return (including any report required pursuant to
Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder), any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use all reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
governmental authority or customer of the MDL Group Companies or any other
person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including but not limited to with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  

### (h) At the Closing, Elsevier Inc. shall deliver, and shall cause MDL US
to deliver, to Buyer (i) a statement conforming to the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) or 1.1445-2(b)(2), as applicable;
and (ii) the notification to the Internal Revenue Service required under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.897 - 2(h)(2).

  

### (i) All payments and amounts payable by Buyer to any of the Sellers under
this Agreement will be subject to deduction and withholding for or on account
of any Tax to the extent required by applicable Law, and any amount so
deducted or withheld shall be treated as actually paid to Sellers.

       

## Section 4.9 _Use of Business Names by Buyer and the MDL Group Companies_.

  

### (a) Except as expressly provided in this Section 4.9(a) or in the
Transition Services Agreement or the Services Agreements, Buyer shall not use
or do business, and shall cause the MDL Group Companies not to use or do
business, directly or indirectly, or allow any of their Affiliates to use or
do business, under the names and/or marks "Elsevier," "Reed," "Reed Elsevier"
or any other trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos and designations
of Sellers or of its Affiliates (or any other names confusingly similar to
such names and marks).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any
such names and marks appear, as of the Closing Date, on any previously
printed stationery, signage, invoices, packaging, advertising and promotional
materials, packing and shipping materials and other similar materials used or
held for use by the MDL Group Companies, Buyer and the MDL Group Companies
may use, without alteration, such previously marked materials from and after
the Closing Date for a period not to exceed six (6) months, provided that,
after such six-month period, Buyer shall immediately cease, and shall cause
the MDL Group Companies to immediately cease, all use of such materials and
shall not have any further right to use such names and marks or any other
names and marks of Sellers or their Affiliates for any purpose.

  

### (b) Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement or
Services Agreements, from and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall not,
directly or indirectly, use or do business, or allow any of their Affiliates
to use or do business, under the "MDL" name and/or mark or any other
trademark, trade name, service mark, logo and designation of the MDL Group
Companies, Buyer or of BuyerÂ’s Affiliates (or any other names confusingly
similar to such name and mark). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that any such names and marks appear, as of the Closing Date, on any
previously printed stationery, signage, invoices, packaging, advertising and
promotional materials, packing and shipping materials and other similar
materials used or held for use by Sellers, Sellers may use, without
alteration, such previously marked materials from and after the Closing Date
for a period not to exceed six (6) months, provided that, after such six-
month period, Sellers shall immediately cease all use of such materials and
shall not have any further right to use such names and marks or any other
names and marks of the MDL Group Companies, Buyer or of BuyerÂ’s Affiliates
for any purpose except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services
Agreement.

  

## Section 4.10 _Preservation of Records_. Sellers and Buyer agree that each
of them shall preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
business of the MDL Group Companies for a period of seven (7) years from the
Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel available to the other
as may be reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other
things, any Tax audits, any insurance claims by or legal proceedings against
or governmental investigations of Sellers or Buyer or any of their Affiliates
or in order to enable Sellers or Buyer to comply with their respective
obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

## Section 4.11 _Mail and Communications_. Sellers shall promptly remit to
Buyer any mail or other communications of the MDL Group Companies received by
Sellers from and after the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the MDL Group
Companies to promptly remit to Sellers any mail or other communications of
Sellers received by the MDL Group Companies from and after the Closing Date.

       

## Section 4.12 _Intercompany Balances and Cash Pooling Arrangements; Cash
Settlement_.

  

### (a) Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that, as of the Closing Date,
all intercompany account balances and cash pooling arrangements between the
MDL Group Companies, on the one hand, and Sellers and their Affiliates, on
the other hand (" _Intercompany Balances_ "), shall be eliminated, either
through the capitalization, dividend and/or cancellation of such Intercompany
Balances or otherwise, such that, as of the Closing Date and thereafter,
except pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or the Services
Agreements, (i) no amounts shall be payable (x) by the MDL Group Companies to
Sellers or any of their Affiliates in respect of any Intercompany Balances or
(y) to the MDL Group Companies by Sellers or any of their Affiliates in
respect of any Intercompany Balances, as the case may be, and (ii) no party
hereto shall have any claim, action or other right against any other party
with respect to any funds, accounts or other assets (or the proceeds thereof)
that were subject to or arose out of any Intercompany Balances on or prior to
the Closing Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes of the MDL Group
Companies arising from such elimination shall be for the account of and paid
by Sellers.

  

### (b) For the purposes of settling the cash and cash equivalent balances of
the MDL Group Companies as of the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer agree that
checks received by the MDL Group Companies through the Closing Date and
entered on its books as of the Closing Date in the ordinary course of
business, but not deposited, shall be the property of, and shall be promptly
delivered to, Sellers and all outstanding checks issued or payments in-
transit made by the MDL Group Companies (i.e., amounts recorded by the MDL
Group Companies in their respective accounting records that have not been
deducted from any of their respective bank accounts) as of the Closing Date
shall be deducted from the amount of all cash, cash equivalents and deposited
checks in the bank accounts of the MDL Group Companies as of the business day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding any amounts received from
Buyer).

  

## Section 4.13 _Access for Integration Planning; Preparation of Financial
Statements_.

  

### (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall be entitled to have such
access to the MDL Group Companies and the management thereof as is reasonable
for the purpose of assisting Buyer in planning for the integration of the
Business following the Closing. Any such access shall be conducted during
the BusinessÂ’ regular business hours and shall be conducted in accordance
with all applicable Laws, including all antitrust and trade Laws. In
connection with such access, Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the
Business.  No information or knowledge obtained in connection with such
access, or in connection with any of the other activities contemplated under
this Section 4.13, shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement, nor shall the same prejudice
any right or entitlement of any Indemnified Party to indemnification under
this Agreement.

  

### (b) Buyer has informed Sellers that it will be obligated to prepare
audited financial statements of the Business prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") in connection with
certain regulatory requirements to which Buyer is subject. Sellers
have agreed to assist Buyer in its compliance with such regulatory
requirements solely to the extent specified in this Section 4.13, including
by implementing with Buyer the special arrangements set forth in _Schedule
4.13_. In connection with the foregoing, Sellers shall use, and shall cause
the MDL Group Companies to use, commercially reasonable efforts to

       

### prepare, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the
following financial statements of the Business, in each case prepared
in accordance with GAAP (collectively, the " _Unaudited GAAP Financials_ "):

  

### (1) unaudited balance sheets, income statements and statements of cash
flows for the Business as of and for the fiscal years ending December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004; and

  

(2) unaudited quarterly balance sheets, income statements and statements of
cash flows for the Business as of and for the quarterly periods ended March
31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 and ending September 30, 2007 (it being
acknowledged that such interim financials for the quarter ending September
30, 2007 cannot be prepared until the financial results through September 30,
2007 are available).

  

### From and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall continue to
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and the MDL Group
Companies in the preparation of the Unaudited GAAP Financials, provided that
Sellers are afforded such access to the books, records, personnel and
professional advisors of the MDL Group Companies as may be reasonably
necessary to enable it to provide such assistance. In connection with
such post-Closing assistance, Sellers shall allow Buyer and its auditors
direct access (i) to the books, records and relevant personnel of Sellers to
the extent necessary to assist in the preparation of the Unaudited GAAP
Financials and (ii) to SellersÂ’ independent accountants to provide reasonable
assistance and to coordinate with such accountants the efforts of BuyerÂ’s
own auditors. Each party shall be responsible for the fees and expenses
incurred by it before and after the Closing in connection with the activities
contemplated by this Section 4.13(b) (including the fees and expenses of
independent accountants, auditors and other professional advisors), provided
that Buyer shall be responsible for the expenses of any audit conducted by
Buyer with respect to the Unaudited GAAP Financials after the Closing.

  

### (c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i) that neither the preparation of the
Unaudited GAAP Financials, nor the ability to prepare or audit such Unaudited
GAAP Financials, shall be a condition to BuyerÂ’s obligation to consummate the
Closing and (ii) that apart from the obligation to use commercially
reasonable efforts as set forth in Section 4.13(b) above (but without
limiting any representation or warranty contained in Section 2.5 with respect
to the Financial Statements as prepared in accordance with the Seller
Accounting Principles), Sellers shall have no liability or obligation to
Buyer or any other person with respect to the Unaudited GAAP Financials.
Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that, for all purposes under this
Agreement, a material breach of SellersÂ’ obligation to use commercially
reasonable efforts under Section 4.13(b) above shall be deemed to exist only
if (i) Sellers fail to devote the internal resources reasonably necessary to
commence and pursue the preparation of such Unaudited GAAP Financials, (ii)
Sellers fail to engage professional advisors reasonably necessary to assist
in the preparation of then Unaudited GAAP Financials or, if retained, such
professional advisors fail to commence their work in a timely manner or (iii)
Sellers fail or refuse to provide Buyer and its auditors with access to
SellersÂ’ books, records, relevant personnel and professional advisors as
contemplated by Section 4.13(b) above.

       

### (d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that material differences may exist in
the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
Business, as the same may be presented in the Financial Statements and the
Unaudited GAAP Financials, due to a variety of factors, including differences
between GAAP and the Seller Accounting Principles, the manner in which the
Financial Statements and Unaudited GAAP Financials have been compiled and
will be compiled, and other factors. Buyer further acknowledges and agrees
that Sellers are not making any representations or warranties with respect to
the Unaudited GAAP Financials (including whether such Unaudited GAAP
Financials are auditable) and that SellersÂ’ only representations and
warranties regarding the financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows of the Business are being made solely with respect to the Financial
Statements to the extent set forth in Section 2.5 of this Agreement.

  

## Section 4.14 _Noncompetition_.

Buyer may enjoy the full benefit of the Business, for a period of two (2)
years from the Closing Date with respect to (i) the MDL Software Products

Elsevier databases), and (ii) the MDL Databases identified below, none of the
Elsevier Companies (as defined below) shall, whether as principal, agent,
partner, officer, director, stockholder, employee, consultant or otherwise,
alone or in association with any other person, own, manage, operate, control,
participate in, invest in (other than an investment that results in such
person owning less than 2% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly
traded company), or carry on a business which is in direct or indirect
competition with the following software products (the " _MDL
Software Products_ ") and databases (" _MDL Databases_ ") of the Business as
the same are marketed and sold as of the date hereof or may be marketed and

contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 4.14 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and
other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid
and enforceable under such Applicable Law. Each Elsevier Company acknowledges

not to, for a period of three years after the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer, disclose to any third

independently developed by any Seller or any of its Affiliates, without
reference to any confidential or proprietary information used in the conduct
of the Business (other than by the Business prior to the Closing) or (z) such
information was not previously known to Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries
but becomes rightfully known to Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date, without restriction, from a source (other than Buyer and
its Subsidiaries) not related to SellersÂ’ prior ownership of the Business, or
(ii) prohibit any disclosure required by any applicable legal requirement, so
long as, to the extent legally permissible, such Seller provides Buyer with
reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to
seek an appropriate protective order.

  

## Section 4.17 _Exclusivity_.

  

 _ _Until the Closing Date or the date upon which this Agreement is
terminated, Sellers shall not, and shall cause each of the Elsevier Companies
and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate or

Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 2.9 (with respect to Buyer, if Buyer were making the representations
and warranties contained therein);

  

### (d) any written notice (or, to SellersÂ’ knowledge or the knowledge of
Buyer, as applicable, other communication) received by such party that any of
the Top Customers has ceased, or will or intends to cease, to use the goods
or services of the MDL Group Companies, or has substantially reduced, or will

or intends to substantially reduce, the sale of such raw materials, supplies,
merchandise, other goods or services at any time, in each case on terms and
conditions substantially similar to those used in its current sales to the

contemplated hereby or otherwise.

  

## Section 4.19 _Acknowledgment of Discontinuation of Services_.

  

### (a) Sellers, Buyer and the MDL Group Companies acknowledge and agree
that, from and after the Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates will not be
providing any Shared Services, use of the Temporary Use Premises or the
benefits of any Master Services Agreements to the MDL Group Companies or the
Business, and the MDL Group Companies will not be providing any Shared
Services to Sellers, except as specifically provided in (x) the Transition
Services Agreement and (y) the Services Agreements. Each party shall be
obligated, at its own cost and expense, to arrange for or otherwise procure
replacement services for the Shared Services, use of the Temporary Use

### such Shared Services, use of the Temporary Use Premises or the
benefits of any Master Services Agreements are not provided pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement or the Services Agreements.

  

## Section 4.20 _Release of Obligations_. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause the MDL Group Companies to reasonably cooperate, with Sellers

counterparties thereto, releases (by novation or otherwise) of Sellers and
their Affiliates (other than the MDL Group Companies) from any contract,
arrangement, guarantee or understanding of the MDL Group Companies with
respect to the Business which imposes any liability or obligation
upon Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the MDL Group Companies).

  

## Section 4.21 _Directors of MDL Sweden_.

2007 through the Closing Date.

  

## Section 4.22 _MDL Sweden Shares_.

  

Sellers have informed Buyer that they have been unable to locate share
certificate No. 1 of MDL Sweden, representing 1,000 shares of MDL Sweden (the
" _MDL Sweden Certificate_ ") and that Sellers believe that the MDL Sweden
Certificate has been lost. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to locate the MDL Sweden Certificate prior to Closing. If such MDL Sweden
Certificate is not located by the Closing Date, promptly following the
Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall initiate a cancellation proceeding in
accordance with the Swedish Act on Cancellation of Lost Deeds _(Lag (1927:85)
om d odande av forkommen handling)_ with respect to the MDL Sweden
Certificate (the " _Cancellation Proceeding_ "). Sellers shall assist in, and
bear all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Buyer in relation to, the
Cancellation Proceeding. Sellers further agree to fully indemnify Buyer for
any Loss incurred by Buyer or MDL Sweden prior to the consummation of the
Cancellation Proceeding in relation to any third party claiming any right to
the MDL Sweden Certificate.

notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions

### (a) by the mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers;

shall promptly appeal any adverse determination which is appealable
(and pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence) _provided_ , _however_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.1(d) shall
not be available to a party if such order was primarily due to the failure of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

## Section 6.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of the

Section 6.1 hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the

## Section 7.2 _Indemnification by Elsevier Inc._

  

### (a) Subject to the restrictions and limitations in this Article VII,
Elsevier Inc., and not any other Seller, shall indemnify Buyer, its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents (collectively, " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them harmless
from any loss, liability, cost or expense (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by such Buyer
Indemnitees to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation
or warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement or as of the Closing Date as if such representation or warranty
were made on and as of the Closing Date, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
undertaking of Sellers contained in this Agreement, (iii) all Pre-Closing
Taxes, except to the extent that a breach by Buyer of its obligations
contained in Section 4.8(b) results in Losses but only to the extent that
such breach increases such Losses, and (iv) liabilities related to the
Elsevier Retained Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term
"Losses" for all purposes under this Agreement shall not include, and no
party shall be required to indemnify or hold harmless any other party for,
any lost profits, diminution in value, restitution, mental or emotional
distress, exemplary, consequential, incidental, special or punitive damages
except to the extent that any of the same are paid by an Indemnified Party to
a third party in connection with a claim asserted by such third party;
_provided_ _however_ , that Losses suffered or incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee
shall

        

### include any lost profits and diminution in value to the extent that the
same result from any final, non-appealable injunction, court order, judgment
or binding settlement materially restricting the freedom of the MDL Group
Companies to operate the Business as the same is conducted as of the date
hereof.

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and without limiting
the rights Buyer has under the affirmative indemnities contained in Sections
7.2(a)(iii) and (iv), no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to reimbursement
or indemnification from Elsevier Inc. with respect to any inaccuracies in or
breaches of the representations and warranties made by Sellers hereunder
(other than Sections 2.2, 2.4 and 2.16) unless and until the cumulative
amount of the Losses suffered or incurred by all Buyer Indemnitees exceeds
Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate, and then only for the
amount by which such Losses exceed such amount (the " _Deductible_ ").

  

### (c) In no event shall Elsevier Inc.Â’s aggregate liability under Section
7.2(a)(i) exceed:

  

#### (i) with respect to claims with respect to all representations and
warranties (other than the IP Representations and Fundamental
Representations) (the " _Category 1 Claims_ "), Eighteen Million Dollars
($18,000,000);

  

#### (ii) with respect to the sum of Category 1 Claims and claims with
respect to the IP Representations (the " _Category 2 Claims_ "), Thirty
Million Dollars ($30,000,000); and

  

#### (iii) with respect to the sum of Category 1 Claims, Category 2 Claims
and claims with respect to the Fundamental Representations, the Purchase
Price.

  

As used herein, (i) the " _IP Representations_ " shall mean the
representations and warranties contained in Section 2.11, and (ii) "
_Fundamental Representations_ " shall mean the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 2.2, 2.4 and 2.16.

  

### (d) "Material Adverse Effect" and other materiality qualifications or any
similar qualifications contained in any representation, warranty, covenant
or undertaking contained in this Agreement shall be disregarded for purposes
of determining the amount of any Losses arising from or relating to
any indemnifiable breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or
undertaking but shall not be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
any such representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking has been breached.

  

## Section 7.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing Date,
to the extent provided in this Article VII, Buyer shall indemnify, and shall
cause the MDL Group Companies to indemnify, jointly and severally, Sellers
and their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents (" _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or
incurred by such Seller Indemnitees to the extent arising from (i) any breach
of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (ii)
any breach of any covenant or undertaking of Buyer contained in this
Agreement, (iii) all Post-Closing Taxes, (iv) except with respect to any
matter for which Buyer is indemnified under Section 7.2 herein, the operation
of the MDL Group Companies and its Business from and after the Closing Date,
including any and all amounts accruing from and after the Closing Date under
the real property leases for the Leased Premises identified on _Schedule
2.6(a),_ (v) the Assumed Liabilities, (vi) any contracts

        

## and guarantees described in Section 4.20 with respect to events arising
from and after Closing, including any and all amounts payable by Sellers as a
result of any events arising from and after the Closing under the guarantees
described therein, (vii) the WARN Act or any similar foreign, state or local
Law arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (viii) any claims for severance or other termination benefits asserted
against any Seller or its Affiliates by any Transferred Employee who is
terminated from and after the Closing Date.

  

## Section 7.4 _Single Recovery_. Any liability for indemnification under
this Article VII shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the set of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking, or
one or more rights to indemnification, including any matter that has been
taken into account as a liability in calculating Closing Net Working Capital
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.3 or for which any reserve related to
accounts receivable has been established in the Financial Statements or in
the books and records of the Company in accordance with Seller Accounting
Principles.

  

## Section 7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Buyer and Sellers each acknowledge and
agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, that the
sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims relating to breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings contained in this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer and Sellers hereby
waive, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights of
rescission.

  

## Section 7.6 _Indemnification Procedures_. If there occurs an event or
occurrence (including any claim asserted or action or proceeding commenced by
a third party) which a party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") asserts constitutes
an indemnifiable event pursuant to Sections 7.2 or 7.3, the Indemnified
Party shall provide written notice to the party obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), setting forth the
nature of the claim and the basis for indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnified Party shall give such written notice to the Indemnifying Party,
with respect to third party claims, promptly after it becomes aware of the
existence of any such event or occurrence and, with respect to all claims
that are not third party claims, promptly after determining in good faith
that Indemnified Party intends to assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder. Such notice shall be a condition precedent to any liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
provide prompt notice as provided herein will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If a party receives
written notice under this Article VII and does not agree that it is required
to indemnify the party giving such notice, it shall give notice of the same
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice
of the claim. In the event that the parties cannot agree whether such claim
is indemnified hereunder within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the
Claim Notice, then the parties shall be free to pursue other available legal
remedies to resolve such dispute. If no Claim Notice is received within such
thirty (30) calendar day period, the party receiving such notice shall be
deemed to have acknowledged liability for the relevant claim. In case any
third-party action shall be brought against any Indemnified Party and it
shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof and its claim
for indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section
7.3, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate

        

## therein and to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel selected by it and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party of such election so to assume the defense thereof,
provided that the Indemnifying Party has not denied its responsibility to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such matter and,
provided further, that any reservation of rights by the Indemnifying Party
with respect to the question of whether it is responsible to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder shall not be deemed to constitute a denial for
purposes of the preceding proviso. The Indemnified Party may participate in
such action and employ separate counsel of its choice, provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , that
if such Claim Notice involves a claim for an injunction against any business
or operations of the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to retain control of the defense of such claim with counsel selected
by it (and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled only to participate in
the defense of such claim, at its sole cost and expense through counsel of
its own choice).  The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with (and
to provide all relevant documents and records and make all relevant personnel
available to) the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense of any
such asserted claim at the cost of the Indemnifying Party.  No Indemnified
Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed, unless such judgment or settlement
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or
plaintiff to each Indemnifying Party of a release from all liability
in respect to such claim. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this
Article VII for any settlement, compromise or discharge of any claim effected
without its consent. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to
pay any amounts payable pursuant to such judgment or settlement and such
third-party claim and (ii) such judgment or settlement includes as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to
each Indemnified Party of an express, complete and unconditional release from
all liability in respect to such claim.

  

## Section 7.7 _Adjustments for Insurance and Taxes_. Each Loss which an
Indemnifying Party is required to pay pursuant to this Article VII shall be
reduced (i) by the amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Party (it being acknowledged and agreed that
the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation so seek any insurance
recovery) and (ii) to take account of any reduction of net Taxes actually
realized by the Indemnified Party as a direct result of such Loss (determined
after properly taking into account the actual and reasonably anticipated
effect on (including increase of) Taxes (including future Taxes) of the
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof as a result of any indemnification
amount paid or payable for such Loss under this Article VII and any
reasonable additional cost incurred to realize such net reduction in Taxes).

  

## Section 7.8 _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to an Indemnified
Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this Article VII, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any
rights which the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may have against any
other persons with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall take such actions as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require to perfect such subrogation or
to pursue such rights against such other persons as the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates may have.

        

## Section 7.9 _Treatment of Indemnity Claims_. Any indemnification payment
by Seller pursuant to this Article VII shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price hereunder.

the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties

any interest herein, and may delegate any duty or obligation hereunder,

time after the Closing, to any purchaser of any or all of the assets or
equity interests (whether by merger, recapitalization, reorganization or
otherwise) of Buyer or the Business or (iii) to any of BuyerÂ’s financing
sources as collateral; _provided_ that, in the case of each of clauses
(i)-(iii), no such assignment or delegation shall relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and

whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are
consummated (a) by Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including, for costs
incurred prior to the Closing, the MDL Group Companies) shall be paid by
Seller, and (b) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, for costs
incurred following the Closing, the MDL Group Companies) shall be paid by
Buyer.

  

## Section 8.13 _No Set-Off_. The obligation of Buyer and the MDL
Group Companies to pay to Sellers the Purchase Price and any other payments
hereunder or under the Transition Services Agreement or any other Services
Agreement shall not be subject to any right of set-off against any of
SellersÂ’ obligations whatsoever, and Buyer and the MDL Group Companies
hereby irrevocably waive any and all such rights.

  

## Section 8.14 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, agent, attorney or representative of Sellers
or the MDL Group Companies or any of their respective Affiliates shall have
any personal liability to Buyer for any obligations or liabilities of Sellers

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; provided that the foregoing
will not affect BuyerÂ’s recourse against Sellers hereunder.

Agreement, and the Table of Contents are for convenience of the parties only,
and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

  

## Section 8.16 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

  

## Section 8.17 _Schedules_. The schedules shall be construed with and as
an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been
set forth verbatim herein.

        

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
signed by their respective directors or officers thereunto duly authorized as
of the date first written above.
