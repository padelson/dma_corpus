- vii \- MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of August 7, 2017, by and between Plains Pipeline, L.P., a
Texas limited partnership ("Seller") and HEP Casper SLC LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("Buyer"). Seller and Buyer are hereinafter
sometimes referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as
the "Parties."

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Seller owns a 50% limited liability company interest (the "Purchased
Interest") in Frontier Aspen LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Frontier"), and Buyer owns a 50% limited liability company interest in
Frontier;

WHEREAS, Seller wishes to sell, and Buyer wishes to purchase, the Purchased
Interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, Buyer and Seller agree as follows:

1\. _DEFINITIONS_. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth in Exhibit A.

2\. _PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE PURCHASED INTEREST_. 

(a) _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall
purchase and acquire from Seller, effective as of the Closing, all of Sellers
right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Interest, free and clear of
all liens or other encumbrances (other than restrictions on transfer arising
under applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or under the LLC
Agreement, including Article 9 of the LLC Agreement, which the Parties
acknowledge has been waived in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement).

(b) Purchase Price; Payment of Purchase Price.

 

(i) The total purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller in consideration
for the Purchased Interest shall be Sixty Million ($60,000,000) (the _"_ Base
Purchase Price _"_ ), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2(c).

 

(ii) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, an amount
equal to the Base Purchase Price. (c) Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Preliminary
Closing Statement") setting forth Sellers calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital based on an unaudited balance sheet of Frontier as of the Closing Date
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles (the "Closing Balance
Sheet").

(ii) Buyer shall have sixty (60) days following receipt of the Preliminary
Closing Statement to review the Closing Balance Sheet and Sellers calculation
of Closing Net Working Capital and to notify Seller in writing if Buyer
disputes the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth on the
Preliminary Closing Statement (a "Dispute Notice"), specifying the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Representatives, Operator and Operators Representatives, as
applicable, including any accounting firm engaged by Seller and/or Operator,
to provide Buyer and its Representatives with access to the books and records
and other supporting data or information of Seller, its Representatives,
Operator or Operators Representatives, as applicable, in connection with
Buyers review of the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement or the
resolution of any dispute with respect thereto, and shall cause the employees
of Seller, its Representative, Operator or Operators Representatives, as
applicable, to cooperate with Buyer and its Representatives in connection
therewith.

 

(iii) If Buyer delivers a Dispute Notice to Seller within the sixty-day time
period referenced in Section 2(c)(ii) above, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable, and, upon
such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be made
in accordance with the agreement of Buyer and Seller. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days of Buyers
delivery of the Dispute Notice (or such longer period as Buyer and Seller may
mutually agree in writing), such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm, and such determination shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts as to which Buyer and Seller have disagreed within the time periods
and on the terms specified above. In making such determination, the
Independent Accounting Firm may rely only upon information submitted to it by
Buyer and Seller. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer and Seller a written
report setting forth the resolution of each disputed matter within thirty (30)
days of submission to it of the Preliminary Closing Statement and the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital set forth therein and, in any case,
as promptly as practicable after such submission. Any expenses relating to the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of its services
pursuant to this Section 2(c)(iii) shall be shared equally by Buyer and
Seller. For purposes of resolving any such dispute, each Party (and its
Representatives) shall provide the other Party and, once engaged for purposes
of resolving such dispute, the Independent Accounting Firm with reasonable
access during normal business hours to all records and information in such
Partys possession or control related to the calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital. The "Final Closing Net Working Capital" shall be (A) if
no Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by Buyer, the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Preliminary Closing 

 



- 2 \-  Statement as originally submitted by Seller, or (B) if a Dispute Notice has
been timely delivered by Buyer, the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital
set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement as adjusted to take into
account the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Section
2(c)(iii).

 

(iv) The "Final Working Capital Adjustment" shall equal (A) if the Final
Closing Net Working Capital is a positive number, an amount equal to 50% of
such number (any such amount, an "Upward Working Capital Adjustment"), or (B)
if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is a negative number, an amount equal
to 50% of such number (any such amount, a "Downward Working Capital
Adjustment").

(v) The "Final Purchase Price" shall equal (A) the Base Purchase Price, (B)
(1) _plus_ any Upward Working Capital Adjustment or (2) _ minus_ any Downward
Working Capital Adjustment.

 

(vi) If the Final Working Capital Adjustment is (A) an Upward Working Capital
Adjustment, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of
the Upward Working Capital Adjustment, or (B) a Downward Working Capital
Adjustment, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of
the Downward Working Capital Adjustment. Any payments required to be made by
Buyer or Seller pursuant to this Section 2(c)(vi) shall be delivered within
five (5) business days after the determination of the Final Closing Net
Working Capital pursuant to Section 2(c)(iii), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, without deduction, set-off, counterclaim or
withholding, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date
of payment at the U.S. dollar prime rate per annum of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the Closing Date. Such interest shall be calculated based on a year
of three hundred sixty-five (365) days and the number of days elapsed since
the Closing Date.

 

(d) Allocation of Purchase Price.

 

(i) In connection with the execution of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer agree
to allocate the Base Purchase Price, as adjusted hereunder, among the assets
of Frontier (the "Purchase Price Allocation"), for U.S. federal and applicable
state income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 755 and Section
1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury
Regulations"), based upon the fair market values of such assets. Consistent
with the foregoing, within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered a single statement setting forth Buyers
proposed Purchase Price Allocation consistent with Section 755 and Section
1060 of the Code (the "Buyer Purchase Price Allocation").

 

(ii) Seller shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of the Buyer
Purchase Price Allocation to review the allocation and to notify Buyer in
writing if Seller disputes the allocation (a "Purchase Price Allocation
Dispute Notice"), specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail.

 



- 3 \- (iii) If Seller delivers a Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice within the
fifteen-day time period referenced in Section 2(d)(ii), Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable,
and, upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Purchase Price
Allocation shall be made in accordance with the agreement of Buyer and Seller.
If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15)
days of Sellers delivery of the Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice (or
such longer period as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing), such
dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and such
determination shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts as to which Buyer
and Seller have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified
above. In making such determination, the Independent Accounting Firm may rely
only upon information submitted to it by Buyer and Seller. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to Buyer and Seller a written report setting forth the resolution of
each disputed matter within thirty (30) days of submission to it of the Buyer
Purchase Price Allocation and the Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice
and, in any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. Any
expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in
respect of its services pursuant to this Section 2(d)(iii) shall be shared
equally by Buyer and Seller. For purposes of resolving any such dispute, each
Party (and its Representatives) shall provide the other Party and,
once engaged for purposes of resolving such dispute, the Independent
Accounting Firm with reasonable access during normal business hours to all
records and information in such Partys possession or control related to the
calculation of the Purchase Price Allocation. The final Purchase Price
Allocation shall be (A) if no Purchase Price Allocation Dispute Notice has
been timely delivered by Seller, the Buyer Purchase Price Allocation as
originally submitted by Buyer, or (B) if a Purchase Price Allocation Dispute
Notice has been timely delivered by Seller, the calculation of the Purchase
Price Allocation as adjusted to take into account the resolution of such
dispute in accordance with this Section 2(d)(iii).

 

(iv) After all disputes have been resolved or agreement has been made with
respect to the Purchase Price Allocation, each of Seller and Buyer agrees to
file all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns with respect to the
assets of Frontier, in accordance with any such agreed allocation as adjusted
as provided herein. Each of Seller and Buyer shall report the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for federal Tax and all other income Tax
purposes in a manner consistent with such allocation, including Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594, any statements required under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.751-1(a)(3) and any allocation required under Section 755 of the
Code, as applicable, and pursuant to this Section 2(d). Seller and Buyer shall
notify and provide the other with reasonable assistance in the event of an
examination, audit or other proceeding regarding any allocation determined
pursuant to this Section 2(d). Seller and Buyer shall not take any position in
any Tax Return, Tax proceeding or audit that is inconsistent with such
allocation unless required to do so by a final determination as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer nor
Seller shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion
to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar
proceedings in connection with the Purchase Price Allocation. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 2(d) shall survive the
Closing Date indefinitely.

Agreement (the "Closing") shall occur on the last business day of the month

following the Closing Date (but in any event within sixty (60) days after the

Buyer, including all operating and technical data and specifications. Seller
is not obligated to create any books and records for Buyer or to provide them
in a form or format other than the form or format in which they exist as of

as otherwise expressly provided herein. Books and records will be provided
to Buyer in the formats and on media used by Seller in the Ordinary Course of

If Buyer reasonably requests any books and records in a specific format or
report form, and Seller agrees, in its discretion, Buyer will be responsible
for all reasonable costs incurred by Seller to provide such books and records
in such requested format or report form to Buyer at Buyers reasonable cost
and expense.

(iii) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. For a period of two (2) years
following the Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause all of its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and

Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide to Seller and
Sellers Affiliates (and their counsel, auditors, accountants, agents,
advisors or other representatives) reasonable access to and permission to make
copies of any books, records or accounts relating to Frontier through and
including the Closing Date at Sellers expense. Seller agrees to consult with
Buyer in advance of taking any such actions following the Closing Date with a
view towards establishing a mutually agreeable plan for such visits so
that these actions shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation
of the Frontier Aspen Pipeline. Buyer shall not destroy or dispose of any such
books, records and accounts for a period of at least five (5) years after the

required to be filed, any audit or other examination by any governmental
authority relating to Taxes, any judicial or administrative proceeding
relating to liability for Taxes, or any claim for refund in respect of
such Taxes or in connection with any litigation and proceedings or
liabilities related to Frontier; _provided that_ nothing herein shall require
the assisting Party to create, recreate, generate or obtain, in connection
with rendering such assistance, any records, analyses or other documents not
then in the possession or control of such assisting Party. The requesting
Party shall reimburse the assisting Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the assisting Party.

(ii) _Amendment of the Disclosure Schedules_. Buyer agrees that, with respect
to the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall have the continuing obligation until Closing to add, supplement,
or amend the Disclosure Schedules to its representations and warranties with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Disclosure Schedules. For all purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining indemnification in

 



- 18 \-  Article 11 and whether the conditions set forth in Sections 9(b)(i) and
9(b)(ii) have been fulfilled, the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on date of this Agreement and
shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement, or amendment thereto, and such information shall not cure any
breach of the applicable representation and warranty of Seller or
Frontier contained in this Agreement.

Pipeline is condemned or taken by eminent domain, or is damaged or destroyed
by fire, explosion, accident, act of the public enemy, act of God, flood,

writing promptly after Seller learns of such event. If such Casualty Loss is
mutually determined by the Parties in good faith to be less than 10% of the
Base Purchase Price, the Closing shall not be affected, and such Casualty Loss
shall be addressed in accordance with the LLC Agreement. If any Casualty Loss
equals or exceeds 10% of the Buyer Purchase Price, both Buyer and Seller shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10(a)(vi).

two (2) business days following the date of this Agreement a list of
employees of Buyer and Seller or their Affiliates who shall be the principal

ordinary course of business and do not pertain to the subject matter of this
Agreement, from and after the date hereof and up to and including the Closing
Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement), Buyer shall not directly
contact or communicate with any employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(except any employees of Seller or its Affiliates who are identified as
principal contacts for transition purposes as provided above) or
any customers of, distributors of or suppliers to the Frontier Aspen
Pipeline, in each case, without Sellers prior written consent.

 

(v) _Assignment to Frontier_.

 

(1) Following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such conveyances, notices
and assumptions and such other instruments, and shall take such further
actions, all as shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer and as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure to Frontier and its successors
or assigns, to convey all of the properties, rights, titles, interests,
estates, remedies, powers and privileges in the Additional Assets.

 

(2) If the assignment of the Additional Assets contemplated in Section
8(c)(v)(1) requires the consent of a Person (including any governmental
authority) that is not an Affiliate of Seller or the Additional Assets are
cancellable by such Person in the event of an assignment (each such Additional
Assets requiring consent or cancellable in the event of an assignment, a
"Restricted Additional Asset"), then Seller shall, and shall cause Frontier
and Operator to, prior to Closing use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
obtain the consent of such Person to such assignment on terms that are
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. All costs and expenses related to obtaining
any consents in connection with the Restricted Additional Assets, whether such
consents are obtained prior to or after the Closing, shall be borne 50% by
Seller and 50% by Buyer.

 



- 19 \- (3) To the extent permitted by applicable law and the terms of the
Restricted Additional Assets, in the event consent to the assignment thereof
has not been obtained prior to the Closing, then Seller shall continue to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek such consent for a period of six (6)
months after the Closing Date (and thereafter, Seller shall cooperate with
Frontier in obtaining such consents), and, until such time as such consent
shall have been obtained, such Restricted Additional Assets shall be held, as
of and from the Closing, by Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller in
trust for Frontier and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be
performed by Seller (or the applicable Affiliate of Seller) in Sellers or
such Affiliates name and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder
shall be for Frontiers account; _provided_ , that Frontier shall bear all
costs and expenses related to the Restricted Additional Assets from and after
the Closing Date.

 

(vi) _Available Employees_.

 

(1) Schedule 8(c)(vi)(1) of the Disclosure Schedules contain a true and
correct list of all individuals, by position, who are devoted primarily to
providing services to Frontier or SLC Pipeline LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (each such individual, an "Available Employee").

 

(2) Prior to the Closing Date, the Parties will enter into an Employee Matters
Agreement, in a form that is mutually acceptable to the Parties, which will
address the potential transfer of the Available Employees to Buyer or its
Affiliates at the Closing, as well as related employee compensation, benefits
plan and other employee-related matters pertaining to the

(d) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between Buyer and Seller_.

expected to give rise to a Loss or Losses for which indemnification is
provided under this Agreement, the party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnified Party") shall, as promptly as reasonably possible
thereafter, provide written notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought (the "Indemnifying Party"), setting forth the specific facts and
circumstances, in reasonable detail, relating to such Loss or Losses and the
amount of Loss or Losses (or a reasonable, good-faith estimate thereof if the
actual amount is not known or not capable of reasonable calculation)
("Indemnification Notice"); _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
Indemnification Notice on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to make a claim against Seller under Section 11(b) unless and until
(i) Buyer shall have provided Seller written notice of such default and (ii)
Seller shall have failed to cure such default ( _provided_ that such default
can be cured) within thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of Buyers
notice.

(e) Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

(i) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a
claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third
Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must provide an Indemnification Notice
to the Indemnifying Party of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably
possible after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party
Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, within five (5) business

 



- 25 \-  days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
provide an Indemnification Notice, or deliver copies of all notices and
documents, on a timely manner shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim as provided herein, the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third
Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate. Should the
Indemnifying Party so elect in writing within sixty (60) days of its receipt
of an Indemnification Notice of a Third Party Claim to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof (it being understood, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense) and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ that, if (A) in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the
Indemnified Party, there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived or (B) an
injunction or other equitable relief is sought against the Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of a single counsel to the Indemnified Party, it being understood
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim or fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided
in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to clause (iii) below,
pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for
Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party chooses
to defend any Third Party Claim, all the parties shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 

(iii) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The

 



- 26 \-  Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party unless the judgment or proposed
settlement (A) involves only the payment of money damages and does not impose
an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or would
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Indemnified Party and (B) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a complete release
from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim and does not involve
any admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.

(iv) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim,
including by providing reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
each others relevant business records and other documents and employees.

(v) This Section 11(e) shall not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 12(f).

(f) _Losses Net of Insurance_. The amount of any and all Losses under this
Section 11 and elsewhere under this Agreement shall be determined net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies,
indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements with respect to such Losses,
net of any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds, and Buyer shall
use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts (which
the Parties agree does not require Buyer to commence any litigation or other
proceeding) to seek recovery under all insurance covering such Losses to the
same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. Each Party hereby waives, or will procure the waiver of, any
subrogation rights that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable
Losses. 

(g) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Except as otherwise required by
applicable law, any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for U.S. federal and applicable
state income Tax purposes.

of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the
number of total days in the entire Straddle Period; and

predecessors. Such amount of any such refund (including any interest thereon,
