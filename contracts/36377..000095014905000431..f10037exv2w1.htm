under Title I of ERISA or to the imposition of tax under Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code (other

amount due and owing as required by the terms of any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement.
No &#147;reportable event&#148; as defined in ERISA has occurred with respect to any of the Employee

provide security to any Employee Plan pursuant to Section&nbsp;401(a)(29) of the Code. Each of
the Employee Plans that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and neither Company nor any
Company Subsidiary knows of any fact that would adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Employee Plan and which would not be correctible under the Employee Plans Correction
Resolution System (Rev. Proc. 2003-44) without material cost to Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries. All contributions required to be made to each of the Employee Plans
under the terms of the Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable laws have
been timely made. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date
hereof, the Financial Statements of Company properly reflect all amounts required to be

any reason, except as may be required by The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985, as amended or similar state statute.

fringe benefit, consulting contract or similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any
officer, director, employee or other person can be terminated by Company within a period of
30&nbsp;days following the Effective Time of the Merger, without liability to Company or any
Company Subsidiaries. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a material liability of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries following the Effective Time. &#147;<U>Controlled Group
Liability</U>&#148; means any and all liabilities (i)&nbsp;under Title IV of ERISA, (ii)&nbsp;under Section
302 of ERISA, (iii)&nbsp;under Sections&nbsp;412 and 4971 of the Code, or (iv)&nbsp;as a result of a

the applicable requirements for qualification as, a financial holding company pursuant to Section
4(l) of the BHC Act. To Parent&#146;s knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that are
reasonably likely to result in BNP Paribas ceasing to meet any such requirements.
