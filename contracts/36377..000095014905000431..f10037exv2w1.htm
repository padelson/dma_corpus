At the Effective Time of the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Company pursuant to the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement and the Articles of Merger and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the NBCA, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the NBCA.   

 2.2. _Stock of Company_. Subject to Section 2.6, each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall, without any further action on the part of Company or the holders of such shares, be treated on the basis set forth in this Section 2.2.    

 (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. All shares of Company Stock that are owned by Company as treasury stock and all shares of Company Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Company or Parent (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.    

 (b) _Conversion of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Company Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.2(a)) shall be automatically canceled and cease to be an issued and outstanding share of Company Stock and be converted into the right to receive per share consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") in cash in the amount of $34.00.   

 2.3. _Company Stock Options_. Each Company Stock Option outstanding as of the Effective Time of the Merger shall be treated in accordance with Section 12.2.

 (a) At the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.5 through the Exchange Agent, cash in the amount of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to such holders of Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.2 in exchange for their shares of Company Stock (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").    

 (b) Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail, promptly after the Effective Time of the Merger, to each holder of record of shares of Company Stock which are represented by (x) a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (y) an entry to that effect in the shareholder records maintained on behalf of Company by Companys stock transfer agent (the " _Book Entry Shares_ "), whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (if any) shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or authorizing transfer and cancellation of Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, or authorizing transfer of Book Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such shares of Company stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

Shares.

At the Effective Time of the Merger, the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be comprised of the persons serving as directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

 4.20. _Employee Benefit Plans_.    

 (a) Company has previously made available to Parent copies of each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, of which Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a sponsor or participating employer or as to which Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries makes contributions or is required to make contributions and which is subject to any provision of ERISA and covers any employee, whether active or retired, of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, together with all amendments thereto, all currently effective and related summary plan descriptions, the determination letter from the IRS, the annual reports for the most recent three years (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto, and Form 11-K, if applicable) and a summary of material modifications prepared in connection with any such plan. Such plans are hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Employee Plans_ ," and are listed in Section 4.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. No Employee Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified in form and operation under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and the associated trust for each such Employee Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. No event has occurred that will subject such Employee Plans to a material amount of tax under Section 511 of the Code. All amendments required to bring each Employee Plan into conformity with all of the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws have been made, except to the extent that such amendments may be retroactively adopted under Section 401(b) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, all Employee Plans were in effect prior to January 1, 2005, and there has been no material amendment thereof (other than amendments required to comply with applicable Law).    

 (b) Company has previously made available to Parent copies or descriptions of each employment agreement, plan or arrangement maintained or otherwise contributed to by Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which is not an Employee Plan and which (exclusive of base salary and base wages and any benefit required solely under the Law of any state) provides for any form of current or deferred compensation, bonus, stock option, stock awards, stock-based compensation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-termination benefits or insurance, profit sharing, benefit, retirement, severance, change-in-control, group health or insurance, disability, workers compensation, vacation benefits, welfare or similar benefits to or for the benefit of any employee or class of employees, or former employees or class of former employees, or directors or former directors, whether active or retired, of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Such plans and arrangements are hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Benefit Arrangements_ " and are listed in Section 4.20(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, all Benefit Arrangements which are in effect were commenced or in effect prior to January 1, 2005. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, there has been no amendment thereof. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, there has been no increase    ##### 

  

   

in the compensation of or benefits payable to any senior executive employee of
Company or any Company Subsidiary since January 1, 2005 nor any employment,
severance or similar contract entered into with any such employee, nor any
amendment to any such contract, since January 1, 2005.    

 (c) With respect to all Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements, Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance (other than noncompliance the cost or liability for which would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect) with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, governmental or court orders, or governmental rules or regulations currently in effect, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, applicable to such plans or arrangements. All government reports and filings required by Law have been properly and timely filed and all information required to be distributed to participants or beneficiaries has been distributed with respect to each Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement, including, if applicable, Form S-8 registration statements, Forms 11-K and prospectus disclosures with respect to Company Stock offered under any Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement (other than noncompliance the cost or liability for which would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect). Company and the Company Subsidiaries have performed all of their obligations under all such Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements in all material aspects. There is no pending or, to the best of Companys or Company Subsidiaries knowledge, threatened legal action, proceeding or investigation against or involving any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement, other than routine claims for benefits (other than claims which would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect). No condition exists that could constitute grounds for the termination of any Employee Plan under Section 4042 of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan, or any other employee benefit plan maintained by Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which is covered by Title I of ERISA, which could subject any person (other than a person for whom Company or any Company Subsidiary is not directly or indirectly responsible) to liability under Title I of ERISA or to the imposition of tax under Section 4975 of the Code (other than any such transaction the cost or liability of which would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect). No Employee Plan subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or both, has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived, nor has Company or any Company Subsidiary failed to make any contribution or pay any amount due and owing as required by the terms of any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement. No "reportable event" as defined in ERISA has occurred with respect to any of the Employee Plans. Neither Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred nor expects to incur, directly or indirectly, any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA which could constitute a liability of the Surviving Corporation or of any of its Affiliates (including the Company Subsidiaries) at or after the Effective Time of the Merger (other than plans maintained prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by Parent and any of the Company Subsidiaries).    ##### 

  

   

 (d) Neither Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has provided or is required to provide security to any Employee Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. Each of the Employee Plans that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary knows of any fact that would adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan and which would not be correctible under the Employee Plans Correction Resolution System (Rev. Proc. 2003-44) without material cost to Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. All contributions required to be made to each of the Employee Plans under the terms of the Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable laws have been timely made. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, the Financial Statements of Company properly reflect all amounts required to be accrued as liabilities to date under each of the Employee Plans. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, the fair market value of the assets of each Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement that is funded, or required to be funded under the terms of the Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, equals or exceeds the present value of benefit obligations, of such Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letters, Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no obligation to provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be required by The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended or similar state statute.    

 (e) Except for the Scheduled Contracts or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, each Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement and each personal services contract, fringe benefit, consulting contract or similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any officer, director, employee or other person can be terminated by Company within a period of 30 days following the Effective Time of the Merger, without liability to Company or any Company Subsidiaries. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a material liability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

 5.13. _Investment in Company Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub owns or controls, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of Company, other than in accordance with and as permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement.

Except as permitted by Section 6.6(b) below, the Board of Directors of Company shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by Companys stockholders (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Unless permitted by Section 6.6(b), neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the Company Recommendation (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ "), or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Competing Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or public proposal to approve or recommend) by the Board of Directors of Company or any committee thereof of a Competing Transaction, or any failure by Companys Board of Directors to recommend against a Competing Transaction within the 10 business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that relates to a
Competing Transaction (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation unless
Companys Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such
disclosure.

such negotiations or discussions which are sought to be initiated or
continued with Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Company shall promptly
request each other Person, other than Parent or its Affiliates, that has, in
the past twelve months, executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of entering into a business combination
with Company and the Company Subsidiaries (other than a business combination
in which Company or a Company Subsidiary would acquire control of such
Person) to return all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
person by or on behalf of Company and the Company Subsidiaries and enforce
any such confidentiality agreements. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Section 6.7 or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to (but not
after) the date of the Company Stockholder Approval, and subject to

Company or any of its Affiliates or any Representative on or after the date
hereof and which the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation in similar transactions) constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below), if and only to the extent
that the Board of Directors of Company reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that Company shall have given Parent (orally and in writing) at least three
(3) Business Days prior written notice of its intent to do so before taking
the first of any such actions with any one such Person; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Company and the Board of Directors of Company shall keep
Parent informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
discussions or negotiations on a prompt basis, including by providing a copy
of all material documentation or correspondence relating thereto. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_
unsolicited written proposal for a Competing Transaction which the Board
of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation in similar transactions and its
legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal (including, without limitation, all the terms
and conditions of such proposal, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, as well as any
revisions to the terms of the Merger or this Agreement proposed by Parent)

stockholders from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably
capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required
governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of

ARTICLE 12.    

 _EMPLOYEE BENEFITS_     

 12.1. _Employee Benefits_.    

 (a) After the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall continue the Company 401(k) Plans for the benefit of employees of Company and the Company Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time of the Merger ("Continuing Employees"), provided that Parent in its sole discretion, may elect to cease contributions to the Company 401(k) Plans on or after the Payroll Conversion Date. Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in equivalent plans maintained by Parent (including the 401(k) and pension plans of Parent) on and after the Payroll Conversion Date.    

 (b) Following the Effective Time of the Merger and until on or after the Payroll Conversion Date, Continuing Employees shall continue to participate in the Company Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements (other than equity-based plans or arrangements). On and after the Payroll Conversion Date, Continuing Employees shall become eligible for the compensation and employee benefit plans and benefit arrangements of Parent (including, without limitation, the medical, dental, vision, 401(k) and pension plans of Parent) on the same terms as such plans and arrangements are generally offered from time to time to employees of Parent in comparable positions with Parent (subject to any applicable restrictions or limitations on new entrants or categories of entrants), it being understood that, except as otherwise provided in this Section 12.1 or under the terms of any such Company Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement, or compensation and employee benefit plans and arrangements or applicable Law, Parent shall be entitled from time to time to modify, terminate or supplement any such employee plans or benefit arrangements or to substitute new employee plans or benefit arrangements for such employee plans or benefit arrangements in the exercise of their business judgment.    

 (c) With respect to any employee plans and benefit arrangements of Parent in which any Continuing Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time of the Merger (" _New Plans_ "), Parent shall (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements under any such New Plans, except to the extent such conditions or exclusions would have been recognized under the Company Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements, (ii) recognize service of the Continuing Employees which was credited under Company Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements prior to the Payroll Conversion Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the New Plans (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any employee pension plans), (iii) credit any deductibles, co-payments or other out-of-pocket expenses for the current calendar year for each employee and dependent recognized or recognizable under the Company Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements, and (iv) apply any increase in any of the employees portion of the premium cost, deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs no earlier than the later of the first day of the first plan year beginning after    ##### 

  

    

the Effective Time of the Merger of either the Company Employee Plan
or Benefit Arrangement or the employee plan or benefit arrangement of the
Parent. In addition to the foregoing, with respect to all vacation, volunteer
time, funeral time, school conferences, sick time, personal time, and
sabbatical leave that has been accrued through the Effective Time of the
Merger (" _PTO_ ") by any Continuing Employee under the applicable PTO Plan,
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at its discretion, either
pay the Continuing Employee his or her PTO as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time of the Merger or allow such Continuing Employee to convert
such PTO into vacation or sick leave (or a combination thereof); provided,
however, that any such converted PTO may be subject to a maximum cap, with
any excess PTO to be paid in cash to the Continuing Employee as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger. Company agrees that it
will accrue as a liability on its financial statements prior to the Closing
its good faith estimate of the dollar amount attributable to such PTO and
will advise Parent in writing of the amount of such accrual at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, those individuals who are currently receiving
retiree welfare benefits from the Company and individuals who retire within
the twelve month period following the Effective Time of the Merger and are
eligible for retiree welfare benefits from the Company under the terms of the
applicable retiree welfare plan as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, shall be entitled to retiree welfare benefits
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger for employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Continuing Employees who retire after
the twelve month period following the Effective Time of the Merger shall be
eligible for retiree welfare benefits of Parent as may be in effect from time
to time for similarly situated employees of the Parent.    

 (d) Parent agrees that after the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent will pay or provide for the year ending December 31, 2005, to those persons employed by Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and who are eligible, a credit to the employees account under the Commercial Federal Bank Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Highly Compensated Employees (the " _Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") a percentage of compensation through December 31, 2005, or if earlier, the date of termination of employment (provided such termination of employment shall be involuntary and not due to death, Disability or Cause) as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. Company agrees that it will accrue as a liability on its financial statements prior to the Closing its good faith estimate of the dollar amount attributable to such deferred compensation account credit and will advise Parent in writing of the amount of such accrual at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Company also represents and warrants that the only employees of Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are participating in the Deferred Compensation Plan are those that are identified as such in the Company Disclosure Letter and agrees that after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, no other employees shall be designated as participants therein.    ##### 

  

   

 (e) (i) Except with respect to employees described in Section 12.1(e)(ii) below, Parent will pay and provide to employees of Company or the Company Subsidiaries whose employment terminates on or within twelve months after the Effective Date of the Merger as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement severance benefits under conditions and in an amount that are no less favorable to the employee than those contained in the Company Severance Plan as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter as in effect on the date this Agreement is executed.    

 (ii) Parent will pay and provide to Employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries whose employment terminates on or after the Effective Time of the Merger and who, as a result, become eligible for benefits under the terms of the Change in Control Agreements as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, the benefits to which the employee is entitled under the terms of the Change in Control Agreements.    

 (f) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and perform all of the obligations of Company under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and any directors plans, subject to Parents right to amend such plans in accordance with their terms, other than to reduce the amount of benefits previously accrued or required to be credited under Section 12.1(d) hereof or to adversely affect the timing or manner of payment of any benefits due or the intended tax effect to any participant (other than the right, after the Effective Time of the Merger, to receive distributions in the form of Company Stock).   

 12.2. _Company Stock Options, Company Awards and the Company Stock Option Plans_.    

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required (including, if necessary, amending any of the Company Stock Option Plans) to provide for the cancellation of all outstanding Company Stock Options upon the Effective Time of the Merger, in exchange for a cash payment by Parent of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration plus the Special Dividend less the amount, if any, of the Special Retention Bonus paid over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised, whether vested or unvested and whether or not then exercisable. Such payment shall be made by Parent as soon as practicable, but no more than two business days after the Effective Time of the Merger.    

 (b) At the Effective Time of the Merger, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Stock, granted under the Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements (including, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units,    ##### 

  

    

deferred stock units, phantom units and other deferral amounts), other than
Company Stock Options and shares of Company Stock subject to restriction
(each, a " _Company Award_ "), which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger shall cease to represent a right or award
with respect to shares of Company Stock and shall be converted, at the
Effective Time of the Merger, into a right or award with respect to (i) the
Merger Consideration plus the Special Dividend less the amount, if any, of
the Special Retention Bonus paid multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such Company Award, whether vested or unvested (and
the Company Awards otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the Employee
Plans and Benefit Arrangements and the agreements or letters evidencing
grants thereunder). Company agrees that it or its relevant committee shall
take such action prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as may be required
under the terms of any Company Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement to pay
such Company Awards in cash.    

 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 12.2 shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest. It is understood that any payments made by Parent to holders of Company Stock Options and Company Awards pursuant to this Section 12.2 shall be allocable to the portion of the Closing Date following the Effective Time of the Merger for purposes of Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations.    

 (d) The Board of Directors of Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Option Plans and the Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements) shall adopt such resolutions or take such actions as are required to delete as of the Effective Time of the Merger the provision in any other Benefit Arrangements of Company providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of Company Stock or any interest in respect of Company Stock and to ensure that following the Effective Time of the Merger no holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Award or any participant in any Company Stock Option Plan or other Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any Company Stock or any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (e) (i) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain the Companys 2005 annual bonus plan(s) (other than the Management Incentive Plan) (the " _Bonus Plans_ ") for the 2005 fiscal year and shall pay in cash to employees all bonus amounts due under such Bonus Plans pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plans. Any participant in the Bonus Plans who incurs an involuntary termination of employment without cause following the Effective Time of the Merger and prior to the date on which bonuses are paid under the Bonus Plans shall be paid a bonus at such time as bonuses are paid to similarly situated active participants equal to the product of (x) the amount of bonus that would have been paid to such participant had such participant continued in the employ of the Company through the applicable payment date and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the bonus plan year during which the participant was employed by the Company and the denominator of which is 365. Company agrees that it will accrue as a liability on its financial statements prior to the Closing its good faith estimate of the dollar amount attributable to such bonus amounts and will advise Parent in writing of the amount of such accrual at least five (5)    ##### 

  

    

Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Bonuses for the 2005 fiscal year
will be paid no later than 2 1/2 months following the end of the fiscal
year.    

 (ii) Parent shall continue to maintain the Companys Management Incentive Plan (the "Management Incentive Plan") for the 2005 fiscal year and shall pay in cash to participants who are employed on February 28, 2006, 50% of the maximum amount due under such Management Incentive Plan for 2005 pursuant to the terms of the Management Incentive Plan, regardless of whether Bank meets its performance goal(s) for 2005. Any participant in the Management Incentive Plan who incurs an involuntary termination of employment without cause following the Effective Time of the Merger and prior to February 28, 2006 shall be paid a bonus under the Management Incentive Plan at such time as bonuses are paid to similarly situated active participants equal to the product of (x) the amount of bonus that would have been paid to such participant had such participant continued in the employ of the Company through the applicable payment date and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Management Incentive Plan year during which the participant was employed by the Company and the denominator of which is 365. Company agrees that it will accrue as a liability on its financial statements prior to the Closing its good faith estimate of the dollar amount attributable to such bonus amounts payable under the Management Incentive Plan and will advise Parent in writing of the amount of such accrual at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Bonuses for the 2005 fiscal year will be paid no later than 2 1/2 months following the end of the fiscal year.

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Company or Parent as provided in Section 13.1, neither Company nor Parent shall have any further obligation or liability to the other party except with respect to the last sentence of Section 6.3, Section 13.1(k)(iv) and this Section 13.2; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful and material breach of the warranties and representations made by it, or willful and material failure in performance of any of its covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder.    

 (b) Company shall pay Parent (by Fed wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be designated by Parent in writing to Company) an amount equal to $40,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated as follows:    

 (i) if Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 13.1(i) or (j) then Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee on the Business Day following such termination;    

 (ii) if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(b) and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and before the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, a _bona fide_ Competing Transaction (or a proposal therefor) shall have been publicly announced or otherwise publicly communicated to Companys stockholders; and if (C) within twelve (12) months of the date of such termination of this Agreement, Company or any of its Subsidiaries executes any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Competing Transaction, then Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee on the Business Day following such execution or consummation; _provided_ , that for purposes of this paragraph (ii) the term "Competing    ##### 

  

    

Transaction" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 6.7, except that the
reference to "15% or more" in the definition of Competing Transaction shall
be deemed to be a reference to "a majority"; and    

 (iii) if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 13.1(f), (g) or (h) or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(d), (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and before such termination a _bona fide_ Competing Transaction (or a proposal therefor) shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors of Company and (C) following such public announcement or communication of such Competing Transaction (or a proposal therefor), Company shall have intentionally breached (and not cured after notice thereof) any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach shall have materially contributed to the failure of the Effective Time of the Merger to occur prior to the termination of this Agreement, then Company shall pay to Parent 50% of the Termination Fee on the Business Day following such termination; and if (D) within twelve (12) months of the date of such termination of this Agreement, Company or any of its Subsidiaries executes any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Competing Transaction, then Company shall pay to Parent the remaining 50% of the Termination Fee on the Business Day following such execution or consummation; _provided_ , that for purposes of this paragraph (iii) the term " _Competing Transaction_ " shall have the meaning set forth in Section 6.7, except that the reference to "15% or more" in the definition of Competing Transaction shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority."    

 (c) If Company fails to pay all amounts due to Parent on the dates specified in this Section 13.2, then Company shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal, from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent.    

 (d) Parent (for itself and its Affiliates) hereby agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where Parent is entitled to a Termination Fee under this Section 13.2 and Parent receives such Termination Fee, Parent and its Affiliates shall be precluded from any other remedy against Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall seek (and Parent shall cause its Affiliates not to seek) to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or stockholders in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.     #####

 14.6. _Third Parties_. Each party hereto intends that this Agreement shall not benefit or create any right or cause of action to any person other than parties hereto, except as provided in Section 7.4(e).

process on such party as provided in Section 14.2 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.
