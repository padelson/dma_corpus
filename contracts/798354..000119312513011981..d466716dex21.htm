any Vested Options held by employees of the Company or its Affiliates, cause
the Company to process for payment through payroll the amount which such
Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ (subject to withholding

qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions
in which its ownership of property or the character of its activities is such

5.2 _Due Authorization_. Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to

Sub). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each
of Acquiror and Merger Sub and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Acquiror and Merger Sub, enforceable against
Acquiror and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to

the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any provision
of, or result in the breach of any applicable Law, the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of Acquiror or any
Subsidiary of Acquiror (including Merger Sub), or any agreement, indenture or
other instrument to which Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror (including
Merger Sub) is a party or by which Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror
(including Merger Sub) may be bound, or terminate or result in the termination
of any such agreement, indenture or instrument, or result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Acquiror or any Subsidiary
of Acquiror (including Merger Sub) or constitute an event which, after notice
or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in any such
violation, breach, termination or creation of a Lien, except to the extent
that the occurrence of the foregoing would not reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

5.4 _Litigation and Proceedings_. There are no lawsuits, actions, suits,
claims or other proceedings at law or in equity, or, to the knowledge
of Acquiror, investigations, pending before or by any Governmental Authority
or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, against Acquiror or Merger Sub
which, if determined adversely, could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Acquiror or Merger Sub to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement. There is no unsatisfied
judgment or any open injunction binding upon Acquiror or Merger Sub which
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability
of Acquiror or Merger Sub to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

5.5 _Governmental Authorities; Consents_. Assuming the truth and completeness
of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement, no consent, approval or authorization of, or designation,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or other Person is

Merger Subs execution or delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except for as otherwise disclosed on
_Schedule 5.5_.

other amounts required to be paid by Acquiror and Merger Sub on the Closing

banker or other Person is entitled to any brokerage fee, finders fee or other
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates. 

5.8 _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_. None of Acquiror or
Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material 

 



29  respects, and after giving effect to the Merger, at and immediately after
the Effective Time, Acquiror (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value
of its assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present
fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount required to
pay its probable liability on its recourse debts as they mature or become
due); (b) will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in
its business; and (c) will not have incurred and does not plan to incur debts
beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become due.

5.9 _No Outside Reliance_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article
V or any other provision hereof, each of Acquiror and Merger Sub, and any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners,
members or representatives, acknowledge and agree (a) that Acquiror is a
sophisticated purchaser and has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
participation in the Merger, (b) that Acquiror has made its own investigation
of the Company and is entering into this Agreement based upon such
investigation, (c) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates, agents or
representatives is making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express
or implied, beyond those expressly given in Article IV, including any implied
warranty or representation as to condition, merchantability, suitability or
fitness for a particular purpose or trade as to any of the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) that Acquiror and Merger Sub, and
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, members or
representatives, expressly waive any and all rights with respect to, and are
not relying in any way upon, any such representations and warranties mentioned
in the preceding clause (c). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
it is understood that any cost estimates, financial or other projections or
other predictions that may be contained or referred to in the Schedules or
elsewhere, as well as any information, documents or other materials (including
any such materials contained in any "data room" or reviewed by Acquiror
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement) or management presentations that
have been or shall hereafter be provided to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates,
agents or representatives are not and will not be deemed to
be representations or warranties of the Company, and no representation or
warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing
except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, Acquiror understands and agrees that
any inventory, equipment, assets, properties and business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are furnished "as is", "where is" and subject to the
representations and warranties contained in Article IV, with all faults and
without any other representation or warranty of any nature whatsoever.

 

ARTICLE VI.

 

COVENANTS



   6.1 | _Indemnification and Insurance_. 
---|--- 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director and executive officer (vice
president and above) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (" _Company
Indemnified Persons_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or 

 



30  after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under
applicable Law in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such
person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law); _provided_ that any advancement of expenses
to the Company Indemnified Persons shall be subject to the Company
Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced providing an undertaking to
repay such advance if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. Without limiting the
foregoing, (i) Acquiror shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
(A) to maintain for a period of not less than six years from the Effective
Time provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Company
Indemnified Persons that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in
each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (B) for a period of not less
than six years from the Effective Time not to amend, repeal or otherwise
modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights
of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law and (ii)
Acquiror agrees that any indemnification and advancement of expenses available
to any current or former director of the Company or its Subsidiaries by
virtue of such current or former directors service as a partner or employee
of any investment fund that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to the
Effective Time (any such current or former director, a " _Sponsor Director_
") shall be secondary to the indemnification and advancement of expenses to be
provided by Acquiror, the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this
_Section 6.1 _and that Acquiror, the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) shall
be the primary indemnitors of first resort for Sponsor Directors pursuant to
this _Section 6.1_, (B) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of all
expenses and the payment of all Damages with respect to Sponsor Directors
which are addressed by this _Section 6.1 _and (C) shall not make any claim
for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of
any other indemnification available to any Sponsor Director with respect to
any matter addressed by this _Section 6.1_. Acquiror shall assume, and be
jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this  _Section 6.1_.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have been
heretofore made available to Acquiror or its agents or representatives) on
terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation may cause coverage to be extended under the current directors and
officers liability insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing
terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year
period, any insurance required to be maintained under this _Section 6.1
_shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition
thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 6.1 _shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation.

 



31  In the event that Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.1_.

6.2 _Employment Matters_.

(a) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of
continued employment of any employee who continues in the employ of Acquiror,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries immediately following
the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ ") and this Agreement shall not be
construed so as to prohibit the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries from
having the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee,
provided that any such termination is effected in accordance with applicable
Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall give each Continuing
Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting and benefit accrual under any employee benefit plans,
arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related entitlements
provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent
recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
a similar plan, except to the extent such credit would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Acquiror shall not be
required to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual purposes
under any employee benefit plan of Acquiror that is a defined benefit pension
plan.

(c) Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive or cause
to be waived for each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any
waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-
existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other
restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the
welfare plans of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to
such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing
condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would
not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the
welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) give or cause to
be given full credit under the welfare plans of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries
applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-
payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing Date in the same plan
year as the Closing Date, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been
a single continuous employer.

(d) This Agreement is not intended by the Parties to, and nothing in this
_Section 6.2_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall, (i) constitute an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) obligate Acquiror or any Company
to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement, (iii) create any obligation of the parties hereto with respect to
any employee benefit plan of Acquiror or any Company, or (iv) confer on any
Continuing Employee or any other Person (other than the Parties to this
Agreement) any rights or remedies (including third-party beneficiary rights).

 



32 6.3 _Post-Effective Time Access; Preservation of Records_. From and after the
Effective Time, Acquiror will make or cause to be made available to the
Holder Representative all books, records and documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and the assistance of employees responsible for such books,
records and documents) during regular business hours for such purposes as is
believed by the Holder Representative to be reasonably necessary; provided,
however, that access to such books, records, documents and employees will not
interfere with the normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the Holder Representative shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for
their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Acquiror will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain and
preserve all such books, records and other documents for the greater of (i)
seven (7) years after the Closing Date or (ii) any applicable statutory or
regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended, unless, prior to the
destruction thereof, Acquiror gives the Holder Representative reasonable
notice of such destruction and the opportunity to copy or take possession of
all or any portion of such books, records and other documents.

 

6.4 _Discharge of Existing Notes_. The Acquiror shall cause OSI to take any
actions necessary to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of the Notes
pursuant to (i) the notice of optional redemption delivered to the trustee by
OSI prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) the satisfaction and
discharge provisions or the legal defeasance provisions of the indenture
governing the Notes and the other provisions of such indenture applicable
thereto. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of the Notes pursuant
to the preceding sentence is referred to as the " _Discharge_ " of the Notes.

 

6.5 _Additional Matters_. The parties shall undertake the actions contemplated
on Schedule 6.5.

 

ARTICLE VII.

HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

7.1 _Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative_. The parties have
agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of
holders of the Common Stock and the Options for certain limited purposes, as
specified herein (the " _Holder Representative_ "). The parties have
designated Harpoon Holder Representative, LLC as the initial Holder
Representative, and approval of this Agreement by the holders of Common Stock
shall constitute ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder
Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be
removed by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a
Holder Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder
Representative shall be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such
appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the
new Holder Representative.

7.2 _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as
are necessary to carry out the functions

 



33  assigned to it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Holder Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Holders, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full power, authority
and discretion to (i) estimate and determine the amounts of Holder Allocable
Expenses and to pay such Holder Allocable Expenses in accordance with
_Section 3.3_, and (ii) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into
amendments to this Agreement and take actions pursuant to _Sections 3.9_ and
_6.5_ for and on behalf of the Holders. The Holder Representative shall have
no liability to Acquiror, the Company or Holder with respect to actions taken
or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative. The
Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on
any directions received from the Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Holder Representative shall not be required to follow any such
direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity
as the Holder Representative, unless the Holder Representative is holding
funds delivered to it under _Section 3.3_ of this Agreement and/or has been
provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
determination of the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the
Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Holder Representative in responding to such direction or
taking such action. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage
such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem
necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function
hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
Holder Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions
and advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursement from funds paid to it under _Section 3.3_ of this Agreement for
all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and shall be entitled
to indemnification by the Holders against any loss, liability or expenses
arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the
Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder
Representatives bad faith or willful misconduct), including the costs and
expenses of investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the funds
paid to the Holder Representative pursuant to _Section 3.3_ exceed the Holder
Allocable Expenses, the Holder Representative shall distribute such
excess amount to each Holder of Common Shares in accordance with such
Holders Escrow Percentage (as defined on _Schedule 6.5_ ).

ARTICLE VIII.

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of the

Agreement, or in any certificate or report delivered by any of the parties
hereto on or prior to the Closing Date, shall survive the Effective Time.

whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among
any of the parties hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties,
covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist between the parties except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

9.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company shall
not restrict the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to enter
into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.10 to the
extent permitted under Section 251(d) of the DGCL.

 



37 9.11 _Publicity_. Except as required by Law or the rules of a stock exchange
(in which case Acquiror shall give the Company reasonable notice and
opportunity for review and consider in good faith any comments made by the
Company with respect thereto), all press releases or other public
communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of the release for publication
thereof, shall be subject to the prior mutual approval of Acquiror and the
Holder Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld by
any party.

9.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
parties.

9.13 _Jurisdiction_. Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
brought in the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court
shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case
of claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
the State of Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or action,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction,
venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
proceeding or action shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and
agrees not to bring any proceeding or action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to
serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings
or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding
brought pursuant to this _Section 9.13_.

 

9.14 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
the Company nor Acquiror would have entered into this Agreement. Each party
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy
at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at Law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such injunction.

 



38 9.15 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_. Latham and Watkins LLP ("
_L andW_") has represented the Company, the Holder Representative, certain of
the Holders and their respective Affiliates. Each of the parties hereto
recognizes the commonality of interest that exists and will continue to
exist until the Effective Time, and the parties hereto agree that such
commonality of interest should continue to be recognized after the Effective
Time. Specifically, the parties hereto agree that Acquiror shall not, and
shall not cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, seek to have LandW
disqualified from representing the Holder Representative, any Holders or any
of their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute that may arise
between the Holder Representative, any Holders or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, on the
other, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and in connection with any such dispute that may arise between the
Holder Representative, any Holders or any of their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, on the other, the Holder
Representative (and not Acquiror or the Company) will have the right to decide
whether or not to waive the attorney client privilege that may apply to any
communications between the Company and its Subsidiaries and LandW that occurred
before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
any dispute arises between Acquiror or the Company and a third party, the
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by LandW to such third party; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative. The Acquiror and the Company each hereby
acknowledge that each of them have had the opportunity to discuss and obtain
adequate information concerning the significance and material risks of, and
reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other
provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than LandW. This _Section 9.15_ shall be irrevocable, and no
term of this _Section 9.15_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the
prior written consent of Holder Representative and LandW.

9.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this
Agreement), (a) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement
and (b) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or
representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability
(whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Acquiror under this
Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based
on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.
