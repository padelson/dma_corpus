The right to vote in respect of the Scheme Resolution and the General Meeting
Resolutions shall extend to any Ordinary Shares which are issued prior to the
Scheme Voting Record Time as a result of the valid exercise of any Company
Options. Each Company Option which is outstanding and which has not been
exercised prior to the Effective Date (and whether vested or unvested): (i)
that has a per share exercise price less than the Consideration shall be
canceled and terminated at the Effective Time and the holder of such Company
Option shall automatically be entitled to be paid by the Company, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount
equal to (a) the excess of the Consideration over the per share exercise price
of such Company Option, multiplied by (b) the total number of Ordinary Shares
subject to such Company Option (which, in the case of a Company Option that
vests in whole or in part on the basis of achievement of performance goals,
shall be determined as if performance were achieved at 100% of targeted
performance) (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price shall
not actually be paid to the Company by the Company Optionholder); and (ii)
that has a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Consideration
shall be canceled and terminated at the Effective Time, without any payment in
respect thereof (or, if expressly required by the Company Option Plan or

respect thereto. At the Effective Time, each Company Optionholder shall cease
to be a holder of Company Options, such holder's name shall be removed from
the applicable register, the Company Option Plan and all agreements and other
arrangements relating to the Company Options shall be terminated and be of no
further force and effect. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event

vote in respect of the Scheme Resolution and the General Meeting Resolutions

Record Time as a result of the valid exercise of any Company Warrants. Each
Company Warrant that is outstanding and that has not been exercised prior to
the Effective Date shall remain outstanding in accordance with its terms and
shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to be paid
by the Company, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, an amount in cash equal to the Consideration multiplied by the total
number of Ordinary Shares subject to such Company Warrant (less applicable
withholdings and other source deductions), subject to payment to the Company
by such holder of the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant
multiplied by the total number of Ordinary Shares subject to such Company
Warrant.

equal to the Effective Exchange Ratio (as such term is defined in Article 26)

day before the Closing, then promptly after such awareness occurs) of the

reductions of such withholding. Any such amounts will be deducted, withheld
and remitted from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
Scheme of Arrangement and shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement or the Scheme of Arrangement, as applicable, as having been paid to
the Company Securityholder in respect of which such deduction, withholding and
remittance was made; _provided_ that such deducted and withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity.

At any time prior to the Effective Time, and subject to giving the Company no
less than 5 Business Days' notice of its intention to do so, Purchaser and
AcquireCo shall be entitled to effect the Acquisition by way of the Offer

this Agreement for execution by the Parties and that the Parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to execute such definitive agreement
as promptly as practicable and (iii) that each Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as so

affect the obligations of Purchaser or AcquireCo under this Agreement to the
extent not performed by such Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Purchaser shall not be permitted to designate any such Subsidiary if such
designation would reasonably be expected to (a) adversely affect in any

conference, where reasonably practicable to do so, with, any Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by such applicable Governmental
Entity or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences (telephonic or in person), where

clearances; _provided_ that Purchaser, after prior good faith consultation
with the Company and after considering, in good faith, the Company's views and
comments, shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any of the Antitrust Approvals or
Gaming Approvals and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications
with, or Proceeding involving, any Governmental Entity in connection with
obtaining the Antitrust Approvals and the Gaming Approvals; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the consent of each Party shall be required prior to the

respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or
Gaming Law or if any Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is
instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any Governmental
Entity or any other private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or which

best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed. Purchaser shall not
authorize or announce an intention to authorize, or enter into agreements
providing for, any acquisitions of a substantial equity interest in or a
substantial portion of the assets of any Person or any business or division
thereof that has not already been publicly announced as of the day before the
date of this Agreement, in each case whether by merger, consolidation,
combination, acquisition of stock or assets or formation of a joint venture or
otherwise, that, in each case, would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay, make more difficult in any material respect or materially
impede the Acquisition or the consummation of any other transactions
contemplated hereby.

   (4) |  

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated
to, and the Parties' "reasonable best efforts" in this Section 4.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be construed to, require Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold
separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to,
any business or assets (whether tangible or intangible) of Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (ii) agree to any
regulatory undertakings or remedies, other than, in the case of clauses (i) or
(ii), divestitures, licensing arrangements, undertakings or remedies that, if
applied to the Company and its Subsidiaries, would not have and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect (without giving effect to any of the exclusions set forth in
clauses (a) through (l) in the definition of such term).

   (1) |  

From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Laws upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to
afford to Purchaser and to Representatives of Purchaser, such access as
Purchaser may reasonably require at all reasonable times during normal
business hours, including for the purpose of facilitating integration business
planning, to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' officers, employees, agents,
properties, books, records and Contracts, and shall furnish Purchaser with all
data and information as Purchaser may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide access to, or cause
its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or disclose any information or
documents to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information or (ii)
access to such documents or information would, in the reasonable judgment of
the Company, give rise to a risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such
documents or

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  


 

     

\- 46 -

 

  

  

 

    |  

information. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Purchaser in a way
that would not violate the applicable Law or waive such a privilege. In the
event that the disclosure of any information or documents would result in the
violation of any applicable Laws, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to implement customary "clean-room" or other similar arrangements if
the Company reasonably determines, upon advice of outside counsel, that such
arrangements are necessary to comply with applicable Law.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

  

   (2) |  

Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 4.5 shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the Company's
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive testing of any environmental media without the
Company's prior written consent, in its sole discretion.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (3) |  

Investigations made by or on behalf of Purchaser, whether under this Section

   (1) |  

Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or
would reasonably be expected to:

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |

    | Section 4.7 |  

Insurance and Indemnification.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (1) |  

Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall purchase customary "tail" or
"run-off" policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing
protection no less favorable in the aggregate to the protection provided by
the policies maintained by the Company which are in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Date and providing protection in respect of claims arising
from facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Date for each
person covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
as in effect as of the date hereof, and Purchaser shall or shall cause the
Company to maintain such tail policies in effect without any reduction in
scope or coverage for six (6) years from the Effective Date; _provided_ that
Purchaser shall not be responsible for paying any premiums in respect of such
coverage prior to the Effective Time.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (2) |  

Purchaser shall and shall cause the Company (and any successors) to honor all
rights to indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation now existing in
favor of present and former directors and officers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and that come to exist in favor of any person who becomes a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons"), and Purchaser shall
cause the Company to ensure that the Constitutional Documents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (or any successor thereto) contain substantially the same
provisions with respect to indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation set forth in the Constitutional Documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date, which
provisions shall not, except to the extent required by Law, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who at any time on or before the Effective Date, were directors
or officers of the Company.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (3) |  

Without limiting the generality of the provisions of 4.7(2), during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time to), to the extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify and
hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and investigation expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out
of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  


 

     

\- 48 -

 

  


 

  

 


 

  

    |  

omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person's capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates which occurred prior to or at the Effective
Time or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall (and Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to), to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, advance, prior to the final disposition of any
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be
sought under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified
Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon
receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if
it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder. If, at any time prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to
Purchaser a written notice asserting in good faith a claim for indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this Section 4.7(3), then the claim asserted
in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4.7(3) or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates (including, following
the Effective Time, Purchaser) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be
sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

   (4) |  

The provisions of this Section 4.7 are intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by each insured or indemnified person, his or her heirs,
executors, administrators and other legal representatives. Purchaser
acknowledges to such insured or indemnified persons their direct rights
against it under this Section 4.7, which is intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each such person, his or her heirs, executors,
administrators and other legal representatives, and the Company agrees to
enforce such provisions on their behalf.

   (5) |  

If Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all of substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, the Company and Purchaser shall
ensure that any such successors or assigns (including, as applicable, any
acquirer of substantially all of the properties and assets of the

Subsidiaries with their respective directors, officers and employees in effect
on the Effective Date.

Purchaser shall, and shall cause FinanceCo to, use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, taken as a whole
(including the flex provisions), described in the Debt Commitment Letters,
including executing and delivering all such documents and instruments as may
be reasonably required thereunder, and using its respective reasonable best
efforts to:

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (a) |  

comply with and maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, negotiate and
enter into Financing Agreements with respect thereto (and maintain in effect
and comply with the terms thereof) on the terms and conditions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letters (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in
accordance with the terms of any "flex" provisions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters (including as specified in any Fee Letter)) or on other
terms no less favorable, taken as a whole, to Purchaser and FinanceCo than
those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall any of the Financing
Agreements, except in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letters: (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing provided for in
the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of Purchaser and AcquireCo to consummate the
Acquisition; (ii) expand, amend or modify the conditions to the receipt or
funding of the Debt Financing beyond those expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters in a manner that would adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Purchaser and FinanceCo to obtain the Debt Financing or
impose any new or additional conditions to the receipt or funding of the Debt
Financing in a manner that would adversely impact in any material respect the
ability of Purchaser and FinanceCo to obtain the Debt Financing; (iii) contain
terms (other than those terms expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters) that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or delay in any
material respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
the date on which the Debt Financing would be obtained or (B) make the funding
of the Debt Financing less likely

enforce its rights against the Financing Sources; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in each case, Purchaser and FinanceCo
may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

  

    | (b) |  

satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, all conditions to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements
relating thereto (including by paying any commitment, engagement, placement or
other fees that become due and payable under or with respect to any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements as and when due);

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (c) |

   (2) |  

Neither Purchaser nor FinanceCo shall agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of,
any condition, remedy or other provision under any Debt Commitment Letter or
any Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company if
such amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to contravene the limitations set forth in Section
4.8(1)(a)(i)-(iv). Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 4.8(2), Purchaser shall
deliver a copy thereof to the Company (with customary redactions with respect
to the related Fee Letter) and references herein to "Debt Commitment Letters"
and "Financing Agreements" shall include such documents as amended,
supplemented or modified in compliance with this Section 4.8(2) and references
to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as amended, supplemented or modified in compliance with
this Section 4.8 and the financing contemplated by the Financing Agreements

In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or would
reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements for any reason or any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn,
repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, (i) Purchaser shall
promptly so notify the Company and (ii) Purchaser and FinanceCo shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as

such event (and in any event no later than the Effective Date), and to
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative
financing from the same or alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing"),
on terms not less favorable, in any material respect, with respect to
conditionality, when taken as a whole, than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters to Purchaser or FinanceCo, in an amount (when combined with
any available portion of the Debt Financing) sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to obtain a new financing
commitment letter (including any associated engagement letter and related Fee
Letter) with respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively, the "New
Debt Commitment Letters"), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company (with customary redactions with respect to the related Fee Letter). In
the event any Alternative Financing is obtained and any New Debt Commitment
Letter is entered into in accordance with this Section 4.8(3), (i) any
reference in this Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing
contemplated by the New Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause
(ii) below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment
Letters" (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include
the New Debt Commitment Letters (and, for the avoidance of doubt, any related
Fee Letter) to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter (or,
for the avoidance of doubt, any related new Fee Letter), as the case may be,
at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any related new Fee Letter) to the extent then in effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and FinanceCo shall not be obligated
to comply with this Section 4.8(3) to the extent that, prior to the Closing,
Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries consummates a financing transaction in an
aggregate principal amount equal to or greater than the aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Financing and the proceeds of such financing are used to
pay the cash consideration for the Acquisition (the "Debt Securities
Offering").

well as applicable regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
of the United States, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 of the Unites
States and the Investment Company Act of 1940 of the United States, in each
case, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing (to the extent
requested by the Purchaser in writing at least 10 days prior to the Closing
Date); (f) using reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser and FinanceCo in
obtaining accountants' comfort letters, if any, including customary negative

any legal opinions that such legal counsel may be required to give in
connection with the Debt Financing, any Debt Securities Offering or any
Alternative Financing; (g) without limiting the obligations of the Company
pursuant to Section 4.10 below, agreeing to enter into such agreements,
including customary payoff letters and perfection certificates, and using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) deliver such officer's certificates and lien
releases, if any, as are customary in financings of such type and (ii)
otherwise grant, and provide customary materials that facilitate the
perfection or enforcement of, liens on the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to such agreements as may be reasonably requested,

shall be required to (i) pay any commitment or other similar fee; (ii) incur
any liability of any kind (or cause their respective Representatives to incur
any liability of any kind) prior to the Effective Time; (iii) other than with
respect to authorization letters referred to above, enter into any binding

cause the Company to provide to each Company Employee who continues to be
employed by the Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
during such period (i) base salary or wage level and annual bonus opportunity
that are not less than the base salary or wage level and annual bonus
opportunity in effect for each such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Date and (ii) retirement, health, welfare and other benefits
(excluding equity awards, defined benefit arrangements, and retiree health and
welfare arrangements, if any) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Company Employee as of immediately prior
to the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing,
following the Effective Time, Purchaser will (or will

    |  

cause its Affiliates to) honor and perform in accordance with their terms all
severance, retention bonus and cash incentive compensation arrangements in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to a Company
Employee and set forth on Section 4.11(1) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such
arrangements, as permitted by this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Letter) or as may be agreed in writing by Purchaser (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ that nothing
herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any specific plan,
program policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere with Purchaser's or any
of its Affiliates' rights or obligations to make such changes as are necessary
to comply with applicable Law.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

  

   (2) |  

Purchaser will cause the Company Employees to be credited for all services
with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for all purposes under employee
benefit plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates under which Company Employees
are eligible to receive benefits at any time after the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "New Plans") for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant but other than for purposes of retiree health or welfare or defined
benefit pension accruals); _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as required
by applicable Law, such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or such service was
not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Purchaser shall ensure that (i) each Company Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage
under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any Company
Employee, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such
New Plan will be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins will be given full credit under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) the accounts of such Company
Employees under any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan are credited
with any unused balance in the account of such Company Employee under the
applicable Old Plan.

Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Purchaser in writing no later

compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall cause the NYX (USA)
401(k) Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to be terminated effective no later
than the day immediately prior to the Effective Date, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing (and with all participant and employer contributions
attributable to payroll periods prior to the termination made as of such
time), and the Company shall provide Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any resolutions or other relevant documentation not
later than three (3) Business Days preceding the Effective Date. Effective as
of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
have in effect a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
("Purchaser's 401(k) Plan"), and the Company Employees who participate in the
Company 401(k) Plan shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser's 401(k)
Plan as of the Effective Time (provided that eligibility requirements are
satisfied after giving effect to service credit recognition under Section
4.11(2)). If the Purchaser requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated
pursuant to this Section 4.11(3), then Purchaser shall permit each Company
Employee participating in the Company 401(k) Plan to effect, and Purchaser
agrees to cause Purchaser's 401(k) Plan to accept, in accordance with
applicable Law, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code) of his or her account balances (including earnings thereon
through the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding
loans) under the Company 401(k) Plan if such rollover to Purchaser's 401(k)
Plan is elected in accordance with applicable Law by such Company Employee,
subject to (i) the Company's reasonable satisfaction that the Purchaser's
401(k) Plan, as applicable, is in compliance with all applicable Laws and that
such plan continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust that forms a part of such plan
is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and (ii) Purchaser's
reasonable satisfaction that the Company 401(k) Plan, as applicable, is in
compliance with all applicable Laws and that such plan continues to satisfy
the requirements for a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and
that the trust that forms a part of such plan is exempt from tax under Section
501(a) of the Code.

matter related thereto or be construed as an amendment of any employee benefit
plan. Nothing contained in this Agreement,

opportunity to consult with the Company regarding (and if Purchaser, AcquireCo
or any of their respective Affiliates are named as defendants in any such
litigation, participate in) the defense or settlement of any such litigation,
and no compromise or settlement of any such litigation shall be agreed to

from a Person, the Company may engage in or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, and furnish access to, and make disclosure of, confidential

regarding such Acquisition Proposal if and only if:

  


 

  

   (1) |  

the Company Board first determines in good faith, after consultation with its

   (2) |  

the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under

---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (3) |  

prior to providing such access or disclosure of confidential information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person, the Company
enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person (unless such Person
is already a party to a confidentiality agreement with the Company) having
terms in the aggregate not more favorable in any material respect to such
Person than the equivalent terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions set forth in this Article 5; and

   
---|---

Section 8.2, (i) the Company may enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board may effect a
Company Change in Recommendation if an Intervening Event occurs and the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that, as a result of such Intervening Event,
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, if and only if:

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

  

    | (a) |  

the Company has been, and continues to be, in compliance in all material
respects with its obligations under this Article 5 and such Superior Proposal,

Article 5;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (b) |  

the Company has delivered to Purchaser a written notice of the determination

    | (c) |  

the Company has provided Purchaser with a copy of the proposed definitive
agreement for the Superior Proposal (which shall include the identity of all
Persons making such Superior Proposal), or, in the case of any Company Change
in Recommendation that is related to an Intervening Event, a reasonably
detailed summary of the basis of such action;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (d) |  

at least four (4) Business Days (the "Matching Period") have elapsed from the
date that is the later of the date on which Purchaser received the applicable
Company Adverse Change Notice and a copy of the proposed definitive agreement
for the Superior Proposal from the Company or, in the case of any Company
Change in Recommendation that is related to an Intervening Event, a reasonably
detailed summary of the basis of such action;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (e) |  

during the Matching Period, Purchaser has had the opportunity (but not the
obligation), in accordance with Section 5.4(2), to offer to amend this
Agreement and the Scheme in order to attempt to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal or to attempt to result in the
Company Board no longer determining that the failure to make a Company Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, as applicable;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (f) |  

if Purchaser has offered to amend this Agreement and the Scheme under Section

---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  


 

     

\- 63 -

 

  

  

 

    |  |  

advisers, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal compared to the terms of the Scheme as proposed to be amended by
Purchaser under Section 5.4(2) or that failure to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation continues to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, as applicable; and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

  

    | (g) |  

prior to or concurrently with entering into such definitive agreement or
effecting such Company Change in Recommendation, the Company terminates this

Fee pursuant to Section 8.2.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (2) |  

During the Matching Period, or such longer period as the Company may approve
in writing for such purpose: (a) the Company Board shall review in good faith
any offer made by Purchaser under Section 5.4(1)(f) to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Scheme in order to determine whether such proposal would,
upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal previously constituting a
Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal or result in the Company
Board no longer determining that the failure to make a Company Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and (b) the Company shall negotiate in good faith, and shall
cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith, with Purchaser to make
such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Scheme as would enable
Purchaser to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
such amended terms. If the Company Board determines that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal or would result in the Company
Board no longer determining that the failure to make a Company Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company shall promptly so advise Purchaser and the Company
and Purchaser shall amend this Agreement to reflect such offer made by
Purchaser, and shall take and cause to be taken all such actions as are
necessary to give effect to the foregoing.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (3) |  

Each successive material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or any material
change to the facts and circumstances relating to the Company Change in
Recommendation, as applicable, shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal, or
new Company Change in Recommendation, as applicable, for the purposes of this
Section 5.4, and Purchaser shall be afforded a new Matching Period from the
later of the date on which Purchaser received the Company Adverse Change
Notice and a copy of the proposed agreement for the new Superior Proposal from
the Company or a reasonably detailed summary of the basis of such action, as
applicable ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in such cases, all references to
the Matching Period shall be deemed to mean two (2) Business Days).

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (4) |  

The Company Board shall promptly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation by
news release after any Acquisition Proposal for the Company which is not
determined to be a Superior Proposal is publicly announced by the Company or
such Persons making the Acquisition Proposal or the Company Board determines

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  


 

     

\- 64 -

 

  


 

  

 

    |  

that a proposed amendment to the terms of this Agreement as contemplated under

longer being a Superior Proposal.

event shall the Company be permitted to put the Superior Proposal to a vote of
the Company Shareholders at any of the Meetings.

   (7) |  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board from taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any information
reasonably required under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board shall not make a Company Change in Recommendation or make or
authorize any disclosure which would reasonably be expected to have the same
effect as a Company Change in Recommendation, except in accordance with this
Section 5.4.

    | Section 8.5 |  

Remedies.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (1) |  

Except as otherwise provided herein (including in Section 8.2), any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (2) |  

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled, without having to prove damages, to injunctive and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, and to enforce compliance with
the terms of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which the Parties may be entitled at law or in equity.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

   (3) |  

Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by such Party, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.5. Any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.5. The
Parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
Section 8.5, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 8.5 are not available or otherwise are
not granted, and

\- 77 -

 

  


 

  

 


 

  

    |  

(ii) nothing set forth in this Section 8.5 shall require any Party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party's right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.5 prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article 7, nor shall the
commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this Section 8.5 or anything
set forth in this Section 8.5 restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 7 or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

  

   (4) |  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed
that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchaser's
and AcquireCo's obligations to consummate the Acquisition only in the event
that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the Marketing
Period has ended and all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing ( _provided_ that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied); (ii) Purchaser and AcquireCo fail
to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.7, (iii) the Debt Financing (including any Alternative
Financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the
conditions of, Section 4.8(3) of this Agreement) has been funded in accordance
with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof
at the Closing assuming satisfaction by Purchaser or AcquireCo of the
conditions precedent thereto under their respective control or the Debt
Securities Offering has been consummated; and (iv) the Company has confirmed
in an irrevocable written notice delivered to Purchaser that if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded or the Debt Securities
Offering has been consummated, then it would take such actions that are within
its control to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including anything
in Section 8.5(3) above), in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce
or seek to enforce specifically Purchaser's and AcquireCo's obligations to
consummate the Acquisition if the Debt Financing has not been funded or will
not be funded at the Closing and the Debt Securities Offering has not been
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by
this Section 8.5 and the payment of the Funding Failure Termination Fee (only
to the extent expressly permitted by Section 8.2(3)), under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of
specific performance to cause the Closing to occur in accordance with this
Section 8.5 and payment of the Funding Failure Termination Fee, or
alternatively, any other monetary damages or other monetary remedies, whether
under this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters or otherwise.

applicable to the Financing Sources, which, without limiting their respective
terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of the third parties
mentioned in such provisions, the Parties intend that this Agreement will not
benefit or create any right or cause of action in favor of any Person, other
than the Parties and that no Person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled
to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any Proceeding or other forum.

  


 

  

    | Section 8.7 |  

Waiver.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Party's
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

  


 

  

    | Section 8.8 |  

Entire Agreement.

   
---|---|---

entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties.

benefit of the Company, Purchaser, AcquireCo and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

   (2) |  

Notwithstanding Section 8.9(1), neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement are assignable or transferable
by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | Section 8.10 |  

Severability.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by an arbitrator or any court of competent jurisdiction, that
provision will be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and effect and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible.

"SCHEME OF ARRANGEMENT

  


 

  

    | 1. |  

In this Article 39, the "Scheme" means the scheme of arrangement dated [l]
20173 between the Company and the Scheme Shareholders (as defined in the
Scheme) under Part VIII of the Companies Law in its original form, as approved
by the Scheme Shareholders or as amended in accordance with its terms and
subject to any modification, addition or condition approved or imposed by the
Court and agreed by the Company and Purchaser and (save as defined in this
Article) expressions defined in the Scheme shall have the same meanings in

    | 2. |  

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles or the terms of any
resolution passed by the Company in general meeting, if the Company issues any
Ordinary Shares (other than to Purchaser, AcquireCo or Purchaser's nominee(s))
on or after the Scheme Voting Record Time and prior to the Scheme Record Time
(each as defined in the Scheme), such Ordinary Shares shall be issued subject
to the terms of the Scheme (and shall be Scheme Shares

(other than Purchaser, AcquireCo or Purchaser's nominee(s)) (the "New Member")
on or after the Scheme Record Time (the "Post-Scheme Shares"), they will
(after the Scheme becomes effective) be immediately transferred to AcquireCo
(or as Purchaser may direct) in consideration of and conditional on the
payment by or on behalf of AcquireCo to the New Member of an amount in cash
for each Post-Scheme Share equal to the consideration that the New Member
would have been entitled to had each Post-Scheme Share been a Scheme Share.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | 4. |  

On any reorganisation of, or material alteration to, the share capital of the
Company (including, without limitation, any subdivision or consolidation), the
value of the consideration per Post-Scheme Share to be paid under Article 39.3
above shall be adjusted by the Directors in such manner as the auditors of the
Company or an independent investment bank selected by the Company may
determine to be fair and reasonable to the New Member to reflect such
reorganisation or alteration. References in this Article to Ordinary Shares
shall, following such adjustment, be construed accordingly.

    | 5. |  

To give effect to any transfer required by this Article, the Company may

transferor a form of transfer or instructions of transfer on behalf of the New
Member (or any subsequent holder or any nominee of such New Member or any such
subsequent holder) in favor of AcquireCo and do all such other things and
execute and deliver all such documents as may in the opinion of the attorney
be necessary or desirable to vest the Post-Scheme Shares in AcquireCo and
pending such vesting to exercise all such rights to the Post-Scheme Shares as
AcquireCo may direct. If an attorney is so appointed, the New Member shall not
thereafter (except to the extent that the attorney fails to act in accordance
with the directions of AcquireCo) be entitled to exercise any rights attaching
to the Post-Scheme Shares unless so agreed by AcquireCo. The Company may give
good receipt for the purchase price of the Post-Scheme Shares and may register
AcquireCo as holder thereof and issue to it certificates for the same. The
Company shall not be obliged to issue a certificate to the New Member for any
Post-Scheme Shares. AcquireCo shall send a cheque (or shall procure that such
a cheque is sent) in favor of the New Member (or any subsequent holder or any
nominee of such New Member or any such subsequent holder) for the purchase
price of such Post-Scheme Shares promptly after the date on which the Post-
Scheme Shares are issued to the New Member.

Company may agree and the Court may allow, if such consent is required), this
Article shall be of no effect.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has undertaken to make any material
amendments or to adopt or approve any new Company Benefit Plan.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

 

  

    | (b) |  

Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been established, operated and
administered in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including ERISA,
the Companies Law and the Code, except for instances of noncompliance that
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each Governmental
Plan, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with the requirements
thereof and (ii) no liability has been incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, to the extent required to be made or paid on or prior to
the date hereof, has not been satisfied in full, in each case, except for
instances of noncompliance that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
All contributions, premiums and other payments required to be made with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan and each Governmental Plan have been made
on or before their due dates under applicable Law and the terms of such
Company Benefit Plan or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or
prior to the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the Company's financial
statements in accordance with IFRS, except, in both cases, where failure to do
so has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened investigations by any Governmental
Entity, termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for benefits in
the ordinary course) against or involving any Company Benefit Plan or with
respect to any obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any
Governmental Plan or asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any
Company Benefit Plan or with respect to any obligation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under any Governmental Plan, in each case, other than any such
investigations, proceedings, or claims that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, or has within the past six
(6) years, any liability (whether direct or indirect, actual or contingent)
with respect to any defined benefit or pension plan, Multiemployer Plan
(whether or not subject to ERISA), or other plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
or the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code, or any
"multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA)
(in each case, whether or not subject to ERISA). No liability under Title IV
of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates

    | (d) |  

Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each Company
Benefit Plan has been registered to the extent required by applicable Law, and
has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.
Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter or opinion letter from
the IRS upon which it can rely that it is so qualified and that the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from U.S. federal income Taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. To the knowledge of the
Company, no fact or circumstance exists which could adversely affect the
registered or qualification status of any such Company Benefit Plan. None of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the Company,
any of their respective agents or delegates, has breached any fiduciary
obligation with respect to the administration or investment of assets under
any Company Benefit Plan, except where failure to do so has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | (e) |  

No Company Benefit Plan provides benefits or coverage in the nature of health,
life or disability insurance following retirement or other termination of
employment, other than (i) death benefits when termination occurs upon death
and (ii) health care continuation as required by Section 4980B of the Code,
ERISA or similar Law of any state ("COBRA") or an applicable employment
agreement or severance agreement, plan or policy requiring the Company to pay
or subsidize COBRA premiums for a terminated employee for up to eighteen (18)
months following the employee's termination.

upon occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i) entitle any
Participant to any compensation, severance pay or any other benefit under any
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) result in any payment, acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in the amount or value of, or
any payment or benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any
Person, or (iii) directly or indirectly cause the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to transfer or set aside

assets to fund any benefits under any Company Benefit Plan. No amount that
could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property), as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any Participant under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise would
not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to
an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code. No Person is entitled to receive
any additional payment (including any Tax gross-up or other payment) from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of the excise
Taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required by Section

this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor FinanceCo has received any notice or
other communication from any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements with respect to (i) any actual or potential breach or
default on the part of Purchaser, FinanceCo or any other party to any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements; or (ii) any intention of such
party to terminate any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements
or to not provide all or any portion of the Debt Financing. Purchaser and
FinanceCo (both before and after giving effect to any "market flex" provisions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements): (x) have
no reason to believe that, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2, they will not be able to satisfy on a timely basis each
term and condition relating to the closing or funding of the Debt Financing;
and (y) know of no fact, occurrence, circumstance or condition that, assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2, would reasonably
be expected to (1) cause any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing
Agreements to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded or
to be or become ineffective, except in accordance with its terms or (2)
otherwise cause the full amount (or any portion) of the funds contemplated to
be available under the Debt Commitment Letters to not be available to
Purchaser and FinanceCo on a timely basis (and in any event as of the Closing,
except in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters). Purchaser
or FinanceCo have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or
deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement.

    | (d) |  

Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2, the
aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing are sufficient in amount to provide
Purchaser and AcquireCo with the funds necessary for Purchaser and AcquireCo
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to satisfy their
respective obligations under this Agreement, including for Purchaser and
AcquireCo to pay the aggregate Consideration, the aggregate payments to be
made (if any) pursuant to Section 2.8 and the aggregate amount of any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt
Commitment Letters and the payment of all fees, costs and expenses to be paid
by Purchaser, AcquireCo or FinanceCo, as applicable, related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees and expenses
relating to the Debt Financing (such amounts, collectively, the "Required
Payment Amount").

    | (e) |  

There are no conditions precedent to the obligation of any party to any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements to fund the full amount (or
any portion) of the Debt Financing, or that would reasonably be expected to
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (nor any term or condition
which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount

available under the Debt Commitment Letters), other than as expressly set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof (the
"Disclosed Conditions"). Other than the Disclosed Conditions, no Financing
Source or other Person has any right to impose, and none of Purchaser,
AcquireCo, FinanceCo, the Company or any Subsidiary obligor have any
obligation to accept, any condition precedent to any funding of the Debt
Financing nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Debt
Commitment Letters, except in accordance with their respective terms. Except
for the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing Agreements, there are no
side letters or other agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings,
whether written or oral, with any Lender, Financing Source or other Person
relating to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of the Debt
Financing in any material respect.

    | (f) |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees
that a breach of the representation and warranties set forth in this Section
(5) of this Schedule D shall not result in the failure of a condition
precedent to the Company's obligations under this Agreement, if
(notwithstanding such breach) Purchaser and AcquireCo are willing and able to
(and actually do) consummate the Acquisition on the Closing in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

 _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
6.2, each of Purchaser, AcquireCo and the Company will, after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt
Financing, any Debt Securities Offering or any Alternative Financing and the
payment of the Required Payment Amount, be Solvent at and immediately after
the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent"
means that, as of any date of determination and with respect to any Person:
(a) the sum of the debt (including contingent liabilities) of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not exceed the present fair saleable
value of the present assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; (b) the capital of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
is not unreasonably small in relation to the business of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, do not have debts, including current obligations, beyond
their ability to pay or refinance such debts as they mature in the ordinary
course of business; _provided_ , _however_ , for the purposes hereof, the
amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount
that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time,
represents the amount that would reasonably be expected to become an actual or
matured liability.
