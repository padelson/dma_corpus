ARTICLE II 
 THE ARRANGEMENT 

   

 2.1. _The Arrangement_. Subject to the terms hereof, at the Effective Time and as more fully set forth in the Plan of Arrangement: 

   

 (a) A newly-formed, Canadian wholly-owned Subsidiary of Portugal (" _Portugal_   _Canada_ ") will acquire all outstanding Italy Common Shares; Italy and Portugal Canada will amalgamate; and each outstanding Italy Common Share (other than ( _x_ ) Italy Common Shares held by a holder who has validly exercised its Dissent Rights or by Portugal or any Subsidiary of Portugal and ( _y_ ) the Italy Restricted Shares) will be exchanged by the holder thereof for: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) 0.672 Portugal Common Shares (the " _Share Exchange Ratio_ "), plus 

   

 (ii) Cdn.$17.50 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ "). 

   

 (b) Each Italy Restricted Share granted under the KEIP Plans and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for the number of restricted Portugal Common Shares (on the same terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the Effective Time to such award of Italy Restricted Shares pursuant to the relevant KEIP Plan under which such Italy Restricted Share was issued and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof) equal to the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. 

   

 (c) Each Italy Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be exchanged for a fully vested option granted by Portugal (a " _Converted Portugal Option_ ") to acquire (on the same terms and conditions, other than vesting, as were applicable to such Italy Option pursuant to the relevant Italy Option Plan under which it was issued and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof prior to the Effective Time) the number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of Portugal Common Shares determined by multiplying (A) the number of Italy Common Shares subject to such Italy Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per Portugal Common Share subject to any such Converted Portugal Option (the " _Converted Portugal Option Exercise Price_ ") will be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of a cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per Italy Common Share subject to such Italy Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, expressed in U.S. dollars based on the noon buying rate of the Bank of Canada on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date; provided that the exercise price otherwise determined shall be increased to the extent, if any, required to ensure that the In The Money Amount of the Converted Portugal Option immediately after the exchange is equal to the in the Money Amount of the corresponding Italy Option immediately before the exchange. The conversion mechanism set forth in this Section 2.1(c) shall be adjusted to the extent required to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the rules, regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, where applicable. 

   

 (d) For greater certainty, if a particular Italy Option includes an Italy SAR, the corresponding Converted Portugal Option will include a stock appreciation right subject to the same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as were applicable to the Italy SAR except that the stock appreciation right, which may be exercised in lieu of, but not in addition to the Converted Portugal Option shall represent the right to receive, upon exercise (and consequent surrender of the Converted Portugal Option), (i) the number of Portugal Common Shares (rounded 

   ##### 

  

   

down to the nearest whole share) having an aggregate fair market value on the
date of exercise equal to the positive difference between (A) the aggregate
fair market value of the Portugal Common Shares subject to the corresponding
Converted Portugal Option and (B) the aggregate Converted Portugal Option
exercise price, (ii) the equivalent amount of cash, or (iii) an equivalent
combination thereof, as Portugal may determine in its sole discretion. The
conversion mechanism in relation to the Italy SAR shall be adjusted
as necessary to the extent required to comply with section 409A of the Code
and the rules, regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, where
applicable.

 3.6. _Compliance; Permits_. 

  

 (a) Each of Italy and its Subsidiaries is, and at all times since January 1, 2004 has been, in compliance with all Laws and Orders applicable to it or by which its properties are bound or affected, other than non-compliance matters that have not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

  

 (b) Neither Italy nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or violation of ( _i_ ) any Law or Order applicable to Italy or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. To the knowledge of Italy, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or threatened
against Italy or its Subsidiaries, other than, in each such case, those the
outcome of which have not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Italy. 

  

 (c) Since January 1, 2004 Italy has complied in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the TSX and NYSE. 

  

 (d) Each of Italy and its Subsidiaries owns, possesses or has obtained, and is in compliance with, all Permits of or from any Governmental Entity necessary to conduct its business as now conducted, except for such failures which have not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

  

 3.7. _Reports; Financial Statements_. 

  

 (a) Since January 1, 2004, Italy has filed with the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities, the SEC, the TSX and the NYSE the forms, reports and documents, including financial statements, annual information forms, material change reports and management proxy circulars required to be filed by Italy under applicable Securities Laws, including but not limited to all documents relating to the transactions contemplated by the Support Agreement (collectively, the " _Italy Documents_ "). The Italy Documents, at the time filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), complied in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Securities Laws and did not contain any misrepresentation (as defined in the Securities Act (Ontario)) or any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Italy has not filed any confidential material change report with the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities or any other securities authority or regulator or any stock exchange or other self-regulatory authority which as of the date hereof remains confidential. None of Italys Subsidiaries is required to file any reports or other documents with any of the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities, the SEC, the TSX or the NYSE. 

  

 (b) The annual audited consolidated financial statements and the quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements (including in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Italy Documents (the " _Italy Financial Statements_ ") complied as 

   ##### 

  

    

to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of
applicable Governmental Entities, the Canadian Securities Regulatory
Authorities, the SEC, the TSX and the NYSE with respect thereto as of their
respective dates, and have been prepared in accordance with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles (" _Canadian GAAP_ ") applied on a
basis consistent throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each
other (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto). The Italy Financial
Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Italy and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring year-end
adjustments that are not expected to be material in amount and the absence of
notes thereto) on a consolidated basis. 

  

 (c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), Italy has been and is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (including, without limitation, Section 402 thereof) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

 (d) The books and records of Italy and its Subsidiaries, in all material respects, ( _i_ ) have been maintained in accordance with good business practices on a basis consistent with prior years, ( _ii_ ) state in reasonable detail the material transactions and dispositions of the assets of Italy and its Subsidiaries and ( _iii_ ) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for the Italy Financial Statements. Italy has ( _i_ ) designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Italy and its Subsidiaries is made known to management of Italy by others within those entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and ( _ii_ ) designed and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements, including that ( _A_ ) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; ( _B_ ) transactions are recorded as necessary ( _x_ ) to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Canadian GAAP and ( _y_ ) to maintain accountability of the assets of Italy and its Subsidiaries; ( _C_ ) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and ( _D_ ) the recorded accountability of assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The management of Italy has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Italys auditors and the audit committee of Italys board of directors ( _i_ ) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect Italys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Italys auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and ( _ii_ ) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Italys internal controls. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) To the knowledge of Italy, as of the date hereof, Italy has not identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Italy, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, when first due. 

  

 (f) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are and were at all times during the audit engagement period with Italy (i) independent registered public accountants with respect to Italy and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and (ii) a "participating audit firm" within the meaning of National Instrument 52-108  Auditor Oversight of the Canadian Securities Administrators and in compliance with any restrictions or sanctions imposed by the "Canadian Public Accountability Board". 

  

 (g) No attorney representing Italy or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Italy or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of any Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Italy or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to Italys chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the board of directors or the board of directors. 

  

 (h) None of the information to be supplied by Italy or its Affiliates in writing specifically for use in the Portugal Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing of the Portugal Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Portugal Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

  

 (i) None of the information to be included in or incorporated by reference into the Italy Circular (other than information supplied in writing by Portugal specifically for use therein) will, at the time of the mailing of the Italy Circular and any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Italy Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

  

 3.8. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as Disclosed to Portugal, neither Italy nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise) or obligations, in each case, of the type that would be required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of Italy (or the notes thereto) and there is no existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that could be reasonably expected to result in such a liability or obligation, except ( _i_ ) liabilities or obligations fully reflected or reserved against in Italys balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 (or the notes 

   ##### 

  

    

thereto), included in the Italy Financial Statements, ( _ii_ ) liabilities or
obligations disclosed in any Italy Document filed after December 31, 2005 and
prior to the date of this Agreement, ( _iii_ ) liabilities incurred since
December 31, 2005 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, ( _iv_ ) obligations arising pursuant to the terms of the Contracts

) liabilities or obligations that have not had and would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Italy. 

  

 3.9. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2005, the business of Italy and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past practices and except as Disclosed Publicly by Italy there has not been ( _i_ ) any event, occurrence or development of a state of circumstances or facts which has had or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have any Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy, ( _ii_ ) any material revaluation by Italy of any of its assets, including, without limitation, writing down the value of capitalized inventory or writing off notes or accounts receivable or any material sale of assets of Italy other than in the ordinary course of business, ( _iii_ ) any material damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to any material assets of Italy or its Subsidiaries, ( _iv_ ) any Material Italy Contract cancelled, terminated, or materially adversely modified that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy or ( _v_ ) any event or action that if taken after the date hereof would be prohibited by Section 5.1 hereof. 

  

 3.10. _Absence of Litigation_. Except as Disclosed Publicly by Italy or as Disclosed to Portugal, ( _a_ ) there is no Action that has been commenced or, to the knowledge of Italy, threatened against or affecting Italy or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective properties, rights or assets before any Governmental Entity which, if determined adversely with respect to Italy, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Italy; and ( _b_ ) neither Italy nor any Subsidiary thereof, nor any of their respective properties, rights or assets, is subject to any outstanding Order that has had or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

  

 3.11. _Employee Plans_. 

  

 (a) Italy and each Subsidiary thereof has complied, in all material respects, with all the terms of, and all applicable Laws in respect of, each Italy Employee Plan, and has made all funding contributions required under applicable Law to be made to such Italy Employee Plans. All Italy Employee Plans are in good standing in all material respects under applicable Law. Italy has Disclosed to Portugal copies of all material Italy Employee Plans (and in the case of any material Italy Employee Plan that is not written, a written description of such plan or board of directors or compensation committee resolution providing for such plan). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each Italy Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified under the Code has been the subject of determination letters from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. Each Italy Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified under the ITA has been established, registered and operated in accordance with the applicable requirements of the ITA and other applicable Law. No step has been taken, no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance exists that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in any Italy Employee Plan being ordered or required to be terminated or wound up in whole or in part or having its tax qualification or registration under applicable Law refused or revoked, or being placed under the administration of any trustee or receiver or regulatory authority or being required to pay any material Taxes, fees, penalties or levies under applicable Laws. There are no actions, suits, claims (other than routine claims for payment of benefits in the ordinary course), trials, demands, investigations, arbitrations, or other proceedings which are pending or threatened in respect of any of the Italy Employee Plans or their assets which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

  

 (c) No event has occurred or condition exists with respect to any of the Italy Employee Plans or relating to any current or former employee of Italy or any Subsidiary thereof (or any of their beneficiaries or dependants) which, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

  

 (d) Except as Disclosed Publicly by Italy or as Disclosed to Portugal, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself entitle any employee or any independent contractor of Italy or any Subsidiary thereof to severance or similar pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) or compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Italy Employee Plan. 

  

 (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of additional acts or events) result in any payment under any Italy Employee Plan that would constitute an "excess parachute payment" for purposes of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code. 

  

 3.12. _Labor Matters_. 

  

 (a) Italy has Disclosed to Portugal copies of all collective agreements (" _Collective Agreements_ ") to which Italy or any Subsidiary thereof is a party. To the knowledge of Italy, there are no threatened or apparent union organizing activities involving employees of Italy or any Subsidiary thereof that are not already covered by a Collective Agreement that would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. Neither Italy nor any Subsidiary thereof is in material violation of any provision under 

   ##### 

  

    

any Collective Agreement. There is no strike or lock out occurring or, to the
knowledge of Italy, threatened affecting Italy or any Subsidiary thereof that
would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

  

 (b) Neither Italy nor any Subsidiary thereof is subject to any claim for wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal or any other tort claim, actual or threatened, or any litigation, actual or threatened, relating to its employees or independent contractors (including any termination of such persons) other than those claims or such litigation as would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. Italy and each Subsidiary thereof has operated in material compliance with all applicable Laws with respect to employment and labor, including, but not limited to, employment and labor standards, occupational health and/or safety, employment equity, pay equity, workers compensation, human rights and labor relations and there are no current, pending or threatened proceedings before any board or tribunal with respect to any of the areas listed herein other than where the failure to so operate, or for such proceedings which individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. Italy and each Subsidiary thereof has operated in material compliance with the National Labor Relations Act (U.S.) as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Labour Relations Act, 1995 (Ontario), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and any and all similar Laws.

 3.13. _Property and Title_. Applying customary standards in the Canadian mining industry, each of Italy, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures has, to the extent necessary to permit the operation of their respective businesses as presently conducted: (a) sufficient title, clear of any title defect or Lien (other than as Disclosed to Portugal or Disclosed Publicly by Italy) to its operating properties and properties with estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and/or estimated mineral resources (other than property to which it is lessee, in which case it has a valid leasehold interest) and (b) good and sufficient title to the real property interests including, without limitation, fee simple estate of and in real property, leases, easements, rights of way, permits, mining claims, concessions or licenses from landowners or authorities permitting the use of land by Italy, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures (other than as Disclosed Publicly by Italy). Italy, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures hold all mineral rights required to continue their respective businesses and operations as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted as Disclosed Publicly by Italy, except to the extent that a failure to do so would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

   ##### 

  

 

Except for such failures of title or liens and royalty burdens that would,
individually or in the aggregate, not have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Italy, (x) all mineral rights held by Italy, its Subsidiaries and
its material joint ventures are free and clear of all Liens and royalty
burdens (other than as Disclosed Publicly by Italy), and (y) none of such
mineral rights are subject to reduction by reference to mine payout or
otherwise except for those created in the ordinary course of business and
which would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

   

 3.14. _Mineral Reserves and Resources_. The estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and estimated, indicated, measured and inferred mineral resources disclosed in the Italy Documents as of December 31, 2005 have been prepared and disclosed in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Laws. There has been no material reduction (other than as a result of operations in the ordinary course of business) in the aggregate amount of estimated mineral reserves and estimated mineral resources of Italy, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures, taken as a whole, from the amounts Disclosed Publicly by Italy. 

  

 3.15. _Operational Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy: 

   

 (a) all rentals, royalties, overriding royalty interests, production payments, net profits, interest burdens and other payments due or payable on or prior to the date hereof under or with respect to the direct or indirect assets of Italy, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures have been properly and timely paid;

 (c) all ( _i_ ) mines where Italy or a Subsidiary of Italy is operator at the relevant time have been developed and operated in accordance with good mining practices and in compliance with all then-applicable Laws, and ( _ii_ ) mines located in or on the lands of Italy, any Subsidiary or material joint venture of Italy, or lands pooled or unitized therewith, which have been abandoned by Italy or any Subsidiary or material joint venture of Italy, have been developed, managed, and abandoned in accordance with good mining practices and in compliance with all applicable Laws, and ( _iii_ ) all future abandonment, remediation and reclamation obligations have been accurately Disclosed Publicly by Italy without omission of information necessary to make the disclosure not misleading, and ( _iv_ ) all costs, expenses, and liabilities payable on or prior to the date hereof under the terms of any Material Italy Contract have been properly and timely paid, except for such

course of business. 

  

 3.16. _Insurance_. Italy maintains insurance policies covering the assets, business, equipment, properties, operations, employees, officers and directors of Italy and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Italy Insurance Policies_ ") which are of the type and in amounts which it believes are reasonably appropriate to conduct its business. To Italys knowledge, there is no material claim by Italy or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any of the material Italy Insurance Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds that would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Italy. 

  

 3.17. _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) _Definition of Taxes_. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax_ " and " _Taxes_ " means any and all taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments imposed by Laws, including all income taxes (including any tax on or based upon net income, gross income, income as specially defined, earnings, profits or selected items of income) and all capital taxes, mining taxes, gross receipts taxes, environmental taxes, profits taxes, disability taxes, registration taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, ad valorem taxes, value added taxes, transfer taxes, franchise taxes, license taxes, development taxes, education taxes, business taxes, social services taxes, surtaxes, land transfer taxes, harmonized sales taxes, withholding taxes or other withholding obligations, net worth taxes, recording taxes, capital stock taxes, payroll taxes, employment taxes, excise taxes, stamp taxes, occupation taxes, premium taxes, property taxes, windfall profits taxes, alternative or add-on minimum taxes, goods and services taxes, service use taxes, customs duties or other governmental charges, estimated or other taxes, assessments, charges, duties or imposts of any kind whatsoever, including Canada Pension Plan and provincial pension plan contributions, unemployment insurance payments and workers compensation premiums, together with any installments with respect thereto, and any interest, penalties, additional taxes, additions to tax or other amounts imposed by any taxing authority with respect to the foregoing and any liability for any such Taxes imposed by Law with respect to any other person, including under any tax sharing, indemnification or other agreements or arrangements or any liability for taxes of a predecessor or transferor entity.

 (i) All Tax returns, statements, reports, forms, declarations, remittances, and similar statements (including estimated Tax returns, claims for refunds, amended returns and reports and information returns and reports) required to be filed with any taxing authority by or on behalf of Italy or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Italy Returns_ ") were filed when due with all 

   ##### 

  

   

appropriate taxing authorities (including any applicable extension periods)
in accordance with all applicable Laws and were correct and complete in all
material respects. 

   

 (ii) Italy and each of its Subsidiaries have timely paid, or withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, all Taxes due and payable by any of them under any applicable Law, including all Taxes required to be withheld, collected and paid in connection with (i) amounts paid or owing to any present or former employee, independent contractor, creditor or shareholder or to any other Person, (ii) goods and services received from or provided to any Person and (iii) amounts paid or credited to any Person not resident in the jurisdiction of the relevant payor. 

   

 (iii) The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to Italy and its Subsidiaries reflected on the Italy Financial Statements (whether or not due and whether or not shown on any Italy Return but excluding any provision for deferred income Taxes) are adequate under Canadian GAAP to cover Taxes accruing through the date thereof.

 (v) There is no Action or audit now pending or threatened in writing in respect of any Tax or "tax asset" of Italy or any of its Subsidiaries.

 (a) Portugal and each Subsidiary thereof has complied, in all material respects, with all the terms of, and all applicable Laws in respect of, each Portugal Employee Plan, and all Portugal Employee Plans required under applicable Law to be funded are fully funded and in good standing in all material respects under applicable Law. Portugal has Disclosed to Italy copies of all material Portugal Employee Plans (and in the case of any material Portugal Employee Plan that is not written, a written description of such plan). 

  

 (b) Each Portugal Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified under the Code has been the subject of determination letters from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. No step has been taken, no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance exists that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in any Portugal Employee Plan being ordered or required to be terminated in whole or in part or having its tax qualification refused or revoked, or being placed under the administration of any trustee or receiver or regulatory authority or being required to pay any material Taxes, fees, penalties or levies under applicable Laws. There are no actions, suits, claims (other than routine claims for payment of benefits in the ordinary course), trials, demands, investigations, arbitrations, or other proceedings which are pending or threatened in respect of any of the Portugal Employee Plans or their assets which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal. 

  

 (c) No event has occurred or condition exists with respect to any of the Portugal Employee Plans or relating to any current or former employee of Portugal or any Subsidiary thereof (or any of their beneficiaries or dependants) which, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal. 

  

 (d) Except as Disclosed Publicly by Portugal or as Disclosed to Italy, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself entitle any employee or any independent contractor of Portugal or any Subsidiary thereof to severance or similar pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any 

   ##### 

  

    

payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) or compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Portugal Employee Plan. 

  

 (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of additional acts or events) result in any payment under any Portugal Employee Plan that would constitute an "excess parachute payment" for purposes of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code. 

  

 4.12. _Labor Matters_. 

  

 (a) Portugal has Disclosed to Italy copies of all Collective Agreements to which Portugal or any Subsidiary thereof is a party. To the knowledge of Portugal, there are no threatened or apparent union organizing activities involving employees of Portugal or any Subsidiary thereof that are not already covered by a Collective Agreement that would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal. Neither Portugal nor any Subsidiary thereof is in material violation of any provision under any Collective Agreement. There is no strike or lock out occurring or, to the knowledge of Portugal, threatened affecting Portugal or any Subsidiary thereof that would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal 

  

 (b) Neither Portugal nor any Subsidiary thereof is subject to any claim for wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal or any other tort claim, actual or threatened, or any litigation, actual or threatened, relating to its employees or independent contractors (including any termination of such persons) other than those claims or such litigation as would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal. Portugal and each Subsidiary thereof has operated in material compliance with all applicable Laws with respect to employment and labor, including, but not limited to, employment and labor standards, occupational health and/or safety, employment equity, pay equity, workers compensation, human rights and labor relations and there are no current, pending or threatened proceedings before any board or tribunal with respect to any of the areas listed herein other than where the failure to so operate, or for such proceedings which individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal. Portugal and each Subsidiary thereof has operated in material compliance with the National Labor Relations Act (U.S.) as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and any and all similar Laws. 

  

 (c) Each of Portugal and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Laws covering occupational health and/or safety, including the Occupational Health and Safety Act (U.S.), as amended, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal. 

  

 4.13. _Property and Title_. Applying customary standards in the United States mining industry, each of Portugal, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures has, to 

   ##### 

  

    

the extent necessary to permit the operation of their respective businesses as
presently conducted: (a) sufficient title, clear of any title defect or Lien
(other than as Disclosed to Italy or Disclosed Publicly by Portugal) to its
operating properties and properties with estimated proven and probable
mineral reserves and/or estimated mineral resources (other than property
to which it is lessee, in which case it has a valid leasehold interest) and
(b) good and sufficient title to the real property interests including,
without limitation, fee simple estate of and in real property, leases,
easements, rights of way, permits, mining claims, concessions or
licenses from landowners or authorities permitting the use of land by
Portugal, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures (other than as
Disclosed Publicly by Portugal). Portugal, its Subsidiaries and its material
joint ventures hold all mineral rights required to continue their
respective businesses and operations as currently conducted and as proposed
to be conducted as Disclosed Publicly by Portugal, except to the extent that
a failure to do so would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Portugal. Except for such failures of title or liens and
royalty burdens that would, individually or in the aggregate, not have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal, (x) all mineral rights held
by Portugal, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures are free and
clear of all Liens and royalty burdens (other than as Publicly Disclosed by
Portugal), and (y) none of such mineral rights are subject to reduction by
reference to mine payout or otherwise except for those created in the
ordinary course of business and which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to Portugal. 

  

 4.14. _Mineral Reserves and Resources_. The estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and estimated, indicated, measured and inferred mineral resources disclosed in the Portugal SEC Documents as of December 31, 2005 have been prepared and disclosed in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Laws. There has been no material reduction (other than as a result of operations in the ordinary course of business) in the aggregate amount of estimated mineral reserves and estimated mineral resources of Portugal, its Subsidiaries and its material joint ventures, taken as a whole, from the amounts Disclosed Publicly by Portugal. 

  

 4.15. _Operational Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal:

Portugal maintains insurance policies covering the assets, business, equipment, properties, operations, employees, officers and directors of Portugal and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Portugal Insurance Policies_ ") which are of the type and in amounts which it believes are reasonably appropriate to conduct its business. To Portugals knowledge, there is no material claim by Portugal or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any of the material Portugal Insurance Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds that would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal. 

  

 4.17. _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Except as Disclosed Publicly by Portugal or as Disclosed to Italy or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Portugal:

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(a) and any other provision of this Agreement, the Italy board of directors shall be permitted to: (i) make a Change in Italy Recommendation, provided that Italy shall have complied in all material respects with all requirements of Section 5.3(f) below; and/or (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide information pursuant to Section 5.3(b) to, any Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, provided that (A) it has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from such Person and the Italy board of directors has determined in good faith based on information then available and after consultation with its financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and (B) prior to providing any confidential information or data to such Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, (x) the Italy board of directors receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement which includes a standstill provision that restricts such Person from acquiring, or publicly announcing an intention to acquire, any securities or assets of Italy (other than pursuant to a Superior Proposal) for a period of not less than one year from the date of such confidentiality agreement and Italy sends a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to Portugal promptly upon its execution and promptly provides Portugal a list of, or in the case of information that was not previously made available to Portugal, copies of, any information provided to such Person, and (y) Italy has complied in all material respects with Section 5.3(d). 

  

 (c) Italy will cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any Person by Italy or any Subsidiary thereof or any of its or their representatives or agents with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, whether or not initiated by Italy, and, in connection therewith, Italy will discontinue access to any data rooms (virtual or otherwise) and will request (and reasonably exercise all rights it has to require) the return or destruction of all information regarding Italy and its Subsidiaries previously provided to any such Person or any other Person and will request (and reasonably exercise all rights it has to require) the destruction of all material including or incorporating or otherwise reflecting any information regarding Italy and its Subsidiaries. Italy shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill or similar agreement to which 

   ##### 

  

    

Italy or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with any other Person, other than
to allow such Person to make and consummate a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (d) From and after the date of this Agreement, Italy shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Portugal, at first orally and then in writing, of any proposal, inquiry, offer (or any amendment thereto) or any request for discussions or negotiations in each case or request relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal, any request for representation on the Italy board of directors, or any request for non-public information relating to Italy or any Subsidiary of Italy or any material joint venture or material mineral property relating to or constituting an Acquisition Proposal of which Italys directors, officers, representatives or agents are or became aware. Such notice shall include a description of the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any proposal, inquiry, offer (including any amendment thereto) or request, and shall include copies of any such proposal or offer or any amendment to such proposal or offer. Italy shall also provide such other details of the proposal or offer, or any amendment thereto, as Portugal may reasonably request. Italy shall keep Portugal promptly and fully informed of the status, including any change to the material terms, of any such proposal or offer, or any amendment thereto, and will respond promptly to all inquiries by Portugal with respect thereto. 

  

 (e) Italy shall ensure that its officers, directors, representatives, agents and legal and financial advisors, and its Subsidiaries and their officers, directors, representatives, agents and legal and financial advisors, are aware of the provisions of Sections 5.3(a) to 5.3(d) hereof and agree to be bound thereby, and it shall be responsible for any breach of such provisions by any of them or by any employee of Italy or any Subsidiary. 

  

 (f) Italy shall not make any Change in Italy Recommendation in respect of, or enter into any agreement relating to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by Section 5.3(b)(ii)(B) above) unless: 

   

 (i) the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; 

   

 (ii) Italy has provided Portugal with notice in writing that there is a Superior Proposal together with all documentation detailing the Superior Proposal (including a copy of the confidentiality agreement between Italy and the Person making the Superior Proposal if not previously delivered); 

   

 (iii) at least 10 business days shall have elapsed from the date that Portugal has received a copy of the written proposal in respect of the purported Superior Proposal (or any amendment or revision thereof); 

   

 (iv) if Portugal has proposed to amend the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(g), the Italy board of directors 

   ##### 

  

   

(after receiving advice from its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
shall have determined in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account such
amendments; 

   

 (v) Italys board of directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under all applicable Laws; and 

   

 (vi) prior to entering into an agreement relating to such Superior Proposal (other than the aforesaid confidentiality agreement) Italy shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(j) and paid to Portugal the Italy Termination Fee. 

  

 (g) Italy acknowledges and agrees that, during the 10 business day period referred to in Section 5.3(f)(iii), Portugal shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement. The Italy board of directors will review any proposal by Portugal to amend the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement in order to determine, in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether such proposal would result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal compared to the proposed amendments to the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement. 

  

 (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Italy board of directors from responding through a directors circular or otherwise as required by applicable Securities Laws to any Acquisition Proposal or from calling and holding a meeting of the holders of the Italy Common Shares requisitioned by such shareholders pursuant to Section 143 of the CBCA or ordered to be held by a court pursuant to section 144 of the CBCA. 

  

 (i) Italy acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.3. 

  

 (j) When used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

   ##### 

  

   

(vi) any proposal or offer to, or public announcement of an intention to do,
any of the foregoing from any Person other than Portugal, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Support Agreement. 

   

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal made by a third party to Italy in writing after the date hereof: (i) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, by means of a merger, take-over bid, amalgamation, plan of arrangement, business combination, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, winding-up or similar transaction, all of the Italy Common Shares; (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory (including U.S. and European Competition Authority and any Investment Canada approval) and other aspects of such proposal and the party making such proposal; (iii) in respect of which any required financing to complete such Acquisition Proposal has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Italy board of directors, acting in good faith (after receipt of advice from its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), is reasonably likely to be obtained, (iv) that is not subject to any due diligence condition; (v) that is offered or made available to all shareholders of Italy in Canada and the United States on the same terms; and (vi) in respect of which the Italy board of directors determines in good faith (after receipt of advice from its financial advisors with respect to (y) below and outside legal counsel with respect to (x) below) that (x) failure to recommend such Acquisition Proposal to Italys shareholders would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and (y) such Acquisition Proposal taking into account all of the terms and conditions thereof, if consummated in accordance with its terms (but not assuming away any risk of non-completion), would result in a transaction more favorable to shareholders from a financial point of view than the Arrangement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement and this Agreement proposed by Portugal pursuant to Section 5.3(g), and taking into account the long-term value and anticipated synergies anticipated to be realized as a result of the combination of Portugal and Italy). 

  

 5.4. _Dissent Rights_. Italy shall provide Portugal with a copy of any purported exercise of the Dissent Rights and written communications with such Italy shareholder purportedly exercising the Dissent Rights; and not settle or compromise any Action brought by any present, former or purported holder of any of its securities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement, without the prior written consent of Portugal, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 5.5. _Italy Affiliates_. At least 10 days prior to the Italy Meeting, Italy shall provide to Portugal a list of those persons who may be deemed to be, in Italys reasonable 

   ##### 

  

    

judgment, affiliates of Italy within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under
the 1933 Act. 

  

 5.6. _Preference Shares and Convertible Debentures_. At the request of Portugal, in the event that Italy acquires control of France, Italy shall cause France to use its reasonable best efforts to redeem or repurchase all outstanding France preference shares and convertible debentures (including, without limitation, making offers to purchase any class of preference shares that are not redeemable at Frances option on such terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to Portugal and Italy). Without the prior written approval of Portugal, Italy will not cause France to amalgamate with Italy prior to the time that all convertible debentures and preference shares of France (whether or not redeemable at Frances option) have been redeemed or repurchased in full.

competent jurisdiction, which finding is no longer subject to appeal or
further proceedings, that such person is not entitled to indemnification).
Portugal shall cause Italy and/or its successors to not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify the provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification contained in the Italy Charter Documents as in effect on the
date hereof for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals
who, prior to the Effective Time, were directors or officers of Italy, unless
such modification is required by Law. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Italy shall (or if Italy is unable to, Portugal shall) obtain and pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Italys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as Italys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If Italy or Portugal for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Portugal will, or will cause Italy and/or its successors to, maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by Italys directors and officers liability insurance policy with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of Italy. 

  

 (c) This Section 7.6 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties referred to herein, their heirs and personal representatives. 

  

 7.7. _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (each a " _Takeover Statute_ ") is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Arrangement, each of Portugal, Italy and their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.8. _Section 16(b)_. The board of directors of Italy and Portugal shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the 1934 Act to exempt the exchange of Italy Common Shares for Portugal Common Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers or directors of Italy who may become an officer or director of Portugal subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act. 

  

 7.9. _U.S. Tax Treatment_. Italy and Portugal intend for the acquisition by Portugal Canada of Italy Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement to be treated as a "qualified stock purchase" for U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of which an election under Section 338(g) of the Code may be made. Italy and Portugal shall take all reasonable steps to ensure such treatment, including, if necessary, amending the Plan of Arrangement.

ARTICLE III 
 ARRANGEMENT 

   

 3.1 _Binding Effect_. This Plan of Arrangement, within the meaning of section 192 of the CBCA, will become effective at, and be binding at and after, the Effective Time on (i) Inco, (ii) Phelps Dodge, (iii) Phelps Dodge Subco, (iv) Amalco, (v) all Inco Shareholders, and (vi) all holders and beneficial owners of Inco Options and Converted Phelps Dodge Options. 

  

 3.2 _Arrangement_. Commencing at the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall be deemed to occur in the following order without any further act or formality: 

  

 (a) each Inco Common Share (other than an Inco Restricted Share or a Subject Share) will be transferred by the holder thereof to Phelps Dodge Subco in exchange for (i) the number of Phelps Dodge Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) cash in the amount of the Cash Consideration, and the name of such holder will be removed from the register of holders of Inco Common Shares, and Phelps Dodge Subco will be recorded as the registered holder of such Inco Common Share and will be deemed to be the legal and beneficial owner of such share free of any claims or encumbrances; 

  

 (b) each Inco Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be transferred by the holder thereof to Phelps Dodge Subco in exchange for a number of Phelps Dodge Common Shares equal to the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, and the name of such holder will be removed from the register of holders of Inco Common Shares, and Phelps Dodge Subco will be recorded as the registered holder of such Inco Restricted Share and will be deemed to be the legal and beneficial owner of such share free of any claims or encumbrances, and the former holder of each Inco Restricted Share shall hold the Phelps Dodge Common Shares receivable in exchange on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Inco Restricted Share pursuant to the KEIP Plan under which it was issued and the agreement evidencing the grant thereto prior to the Effective Time; 

  

 (c) each Inco Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and in exchange therefor the holder shall receive a fully vested option granted by Phelps Dodge (a " _Converted Phelps Dodge Option_ ") to acquire (on the same terms and conditions other than vesting as were applicable to such Inco Option pursuant to the relevant Inco Option Plan under which it was issued and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof prior to the Effective Time) the number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of Phelps Dodge Common Shares determined by multiplying (A) the number of Inco Common Shares subject to such Inco Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per Phelps Dodge Common Share subject to any such Converted Phelps Dodge Option (the " _Converted Phelps Dodge Option Exercise Price_ ") will be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of a cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per Inco Common Share subject to such Inco Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, expressed in U.S. dollars based on

the noon buying rate of the Bank of Canada on the last trading day immediately
preceding the Effective Date; provided that the exercise price otherwise
determined shall be increased to the extent required to ensure that the In
The Money Amount of the Converted Phelps Dodge Option is equal to the In The
Money Amount of the corresponding Inco Option. For greater certainty, if
a particular Inco Option includes an Inco SAR, the corresponding Converted
Phelps Dodge Option will include a stock appreciation right subject to the
same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as were applicable to the Inco
SAR (including for greater certainty the right to exercise it in respect of
part of the Converted Phelps Dodge Option to which it relates) except that the
stock appreciation right, which may be exercised in lieu of, but not in
addition to, the Converted Phelps Dodge Option, shall represent the right to
receive, upon exercise (and consequent surrender of the Converted Phelps
Dodge Option), (i) the number of Phelps Dodge Common Shares (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) having an aggregate fair market value on the date of
exercise equal to the positive difference between (A) the aggregate fair
market value of the Phelps Dodge Common Shares subject to the corresponding
Converted Phelps Dodge Option and (B) the aggregate Converted Phelps Dodge
Option exercise price, (ii) the equivalent amount of cash, or (iii) an
equivalent combination thereof, as Phelps Dodge may determine in its sole
discretion. The conversion mechanism set forth in this section 3.2(c) shall
be adjusted to the extent required to comply with Section 409A of the Code
and the rules, regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, where
applicable;

 (e) the Amalgamating Corporations shall be amalgamated and continue as one corporation (" _Amalco_ ") on the terms prescribed in this Plan of Arrangement (the " _Amalgamation_ ") and: 

   

 (i) Amalco shall possess all of the property, rights, privileges and franchises and shall be subject to all of the liabilities, including civil, criminal and quasi-criminal, and all contracts, disabilities and debts of each of the Amalgamating Corporations (in each case excluding any security issued by one Amalgamating Corporation and held by the other Amalgamating Corporation and any liability or obligation of one Amalgamating Corporation to the other Amalgamating Corporation); 

   

 (ii) a conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favour of or against an Amalgamating Corporation may be enforced by or against Amalco;

 (vi) each common share of Phelps Dodge Subco shall become one Amalco Common Share. 

  

 3.3 _No Fractional Phelps Dodge Common Shares_. No fractional Phelps Dodge Common Shares shall be issued to Former Inco Shareholders. Any fractional number of Phelps Dodge Common Shares that would otherwise be received by a Former Inco Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

 3.4 _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted, as required, to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Phelps Dodge Common Shares or Inco Common Shares other than stock dividends paid in lieu of ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Phelps Dodge Common Shares or Inco Common Shares occurring after the date of the Combination Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (but, for greater certainty, not including consummation of the Inco Bid or any Falconbridge Subsequent Acquisition Transaction), so that the Former Inco Shareholders shall be entitled to receive consideration of the same value that they were entitled to receive before such event. 

  

 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge Subco, Inco, Amalco and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from all amounts payable under the Plan of Arrangement (including, without limitation, any amounts payable pursuant to section 4.1) to any Former Inco Shareholder, or holder of Inco Options or other Inco securities or to withhold from all dividends or other distributions payable in respect of Phelps Dodge Shares to be issued under the Plan of Arrangement, such amounts as Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge Subco, Inco, Amalco or the Depositary is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the  _Income Tax Act_ (Canada), the Code or any provision of any applicable federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Former Inco Shareholder, holder of Inco Options or other Inco securities, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amounts so required or permitted to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a Person exceed the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to that Person, Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge Subco, Inco, Amalco and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge Subco, Inco, Amalco or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement or entitlement, and Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge Subco, Inco, Amalco or the Depositary shall notify the Person thereof and remit to the Person any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.

 (c) In the case of Inco Common Shares, other than Inco Restricted Shares and Subject Shares, upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Inco Common Shares which were exchanged in part for cash in accordance with section 3.2, together with the Letter of Transmittal and such other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer of the Inco Common Shares formerly represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of Inco and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder following the Effective Time, a cheque in Canadian currency representing the cash to be paid in connection with the acquisition of such Inco Common Shares. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time and until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by section 6.1(a), each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more Inco Common Shares (other than Subject Shares) shall be deemed at all times to represent only the right to receive the entitlements described in this Article VI.

 6.2 _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Inco Common Shares which were exchanged (in whole or in part) for Phelps Dodge Common Shares in accordance with section 3.2(a) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the cash and a certificate representing the Phelps Dodge Common Shares which such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with section 3.2(a). When authorizing such delivery of cash and a certificate representing the Phelps Dodge Common Shares which such holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the holder to whom a certificate representing such Phelps Dodge Common Shares is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery of such cash and Phelps Dodge Common Shares, give a bond satisfactory to Phelps Dodge and the Depositary in such amount as Phelps Dodge and the Depositary may direct, or otherwise indemnify Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge Subco and the Depositary in a manner satisfactory to Phelps Dodge and the Depositary, against any claim that may be made against Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge Subco or the Depositary with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and shall otherwise take such actions as may be required by the by-laws of Amalco. 

  

 6.3 _Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates_. No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Phelps Dodge Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Inco Common Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate shall have complied with the provisions of section 6.1 or section 6.2. Subject to applicable law and to section 3.5, at the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition to the delivery of a certificate representing the Phelps Dodge Common Shares to which such holder is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount of the dividend or other distribution with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect such Phelps Dodge Common Shares. No interest shall be payable with respect to the cash to be paid in connection with the acquisition of Inco Common Shares. 

  

 6.4 _Limitation and Proscription_. To the extent that a Former Inco Shareholder shall not have complied with the provisions of section 6.1 or section 6.2 on or before the date which is six years after the Effective Date (the " _Final Proscription Date_ "), then the Phelps Dodge Common Shares which such Former Inco Shareholder was entitled to receive shall be automatically cancelled without any repayment of capital in respect thereof and the certificates representing such Phelps Dodge Common Shares and the cash shall be delivered to Phelps Dodge by the Depositary and such Phelps Dodge Common Shares shall be cancelled by Phelps Dodge, and the interest of the Former Inco Shareholder in such Phelps Dodge Common Shares and the cash shall be terminated as of such final proscription date.

EXHIBIT 1 

   

 _Share Provisions of_ 
  _Amalco_   

 

The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the common
shares (each a "Common Share") and the Preferred Shares of Amalco are as
follows: 

   

      1.  |   | _Common Shares_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (a) Voting Rights 

  

 Except for meetings at which the holders of shares of another class or series of the Amalcos capital stock from time to time authorized are entitled to vote separately as a class or series, the holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, to attend (in person or by proxy) and be heard, and to vote on the basis of one vote in respect of each such share held, at all meetings of the shareholders of the Amalco. 

   

 (b) _Dividends_  

   

 (i) Subject to any preference as to dividends attached to any other class or series of shares in the Amalcos capital stock authorized from time to time and ranking in priority to the Common Shares as to dividends, the holders of the Common Shares shall be entitled to receive, and the Amalco shall pay, out of the moneys or property of the Amalco properly applicable to the payment of dividends, such dividends (if any and in such form) as the directors of the Amalco (the "Directors") may in their discretion declare. 

   

 (ii) The Directors may (but need not) determine at any time or from time to time, with respect to any cash dividend declared payable on the Common Shares, that the holders of the shares of such class, or the holders of shares of such class whose addresses, on the books of the Amalco, are in Canada and/or in specified jurisdictions outside Canada, shall have the right to elect to receive such dividend in the form of a stock dividend payable in Common Shares having a value, as determined by the Directors, that is substantially equivalent, as of a date or a period of days determined by the Directors, to the cash amount of such dividend, provided that the Directors may (but need not) value the shares to be issued by way of stock dividend at a discount from the relevant market value thereof of up to five per cent (5%), and provided further that shareholders shall receive cash in lieu of any fractional interests in shares to which they would otherwise be entitled unless the Directors shall otherwise determine. If the Directors shall determine that shareholders are entitled to fractional interests in shares issued by way of stock dividend, shareholders shall be entitled to receive dividends in respect of such fractional share interests. 

  

 (c) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-up_  

  

 Subject to the prior rights of any other class or series of shares in the Amalcos capital stock authorized from time to time and ranking in priority to the Common Shares, the holders of the Common Shares shall, in the event of a distribution of assets of the Amalco among 

    ##### 

  

     

\- 2 - 

  

its shareholders on a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Amalco,
whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of assets of the
Amalco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, be
entitled to receive the remaining property of the Amalco. 

   

 (d) _Other Distributions_  

  

 The Amalco may issue or distribute securities of the Amalco or of any other body corporate (including rights, options or warrants to acquire such securities and any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities) or any other property or assets of any kind (including evidences of indebtedness and any rights, options or warrants to acquire such property or assets), exclusively to holders of the Common Shares by way of a special distribution or otherwise, as the Directors in their discretion may declare. 

   

     2.  |   | _Preferred Shares_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (a) The Directors may, at any time and from time to time, issue the Preferred Shares in one or more series, each series to consist of such number of shares as the Directors determine before issuance of any shares of such series. 

  

 (b) Subject to the following provisions, and subject to the filing of articles of amendment in prescribed form and the endorsement thereon of a certificate of amendment, in accordance with the  _Canada Business Corporations Act_ , the Directors may fix from time to time before the issue of shares of any series, the number of shares that is to comprise such series and the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to such series of Preferred Shares including, without limitation, the rate or amount of any dividends or the method of calculating any dividends, the dates of payment of dividends, and any redemption, purchase, conversion or exchange prices and terms. In addition, the Directors may change the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to any series of Preferred Shares of which no shares have been issued. 

  

 (c) The Preferred Shares of any series may be made convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares of the Company or another corporation. 

  

 (d) The Preferred Shares of each series, with respect to the payment of any dividends and any distribution of assets or return of capital in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, rank on a parity with the Preferred Shares of every other series with respect to priority in the payment of dividends and return of capital in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company. 

  

 (e) Subject to the provisions respecting any particular series and subject to subparagraphs (f) and (g), the holders of Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive notice of, nor to attend or vote at meetings of the shareholders of the Company. 

  

 (f) The provisions attaching to the Preferred Shares as a class may be amended or repealed at any time with such approval as is then required by law to be given by the holders of the Preferred Shares as a class. 

  

 (g) Subject to the terms of any series of Preferred Shares, the holders of the Preferred Shares as a class and the holders of shares of any particular series of Preferred Shares are not 

   ##### 

  

  

\- 3 - 

  

entitled to vote separately as a class or series, as the case may be, upon,
and are not entitled to dissent in respect of, any proposal to amend the
articles of the Company to: 

    

 (i) increase or decrease any maximum number of authorized shares of such class or series, or increase any maximum number of authorized shares of a class or series having rights or privileges equal or superior to the shares of such class or series; 

   

 (ii) effect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the shares of such class or series; and 

   

 (iii) create a new class or series of shares equal or superior to the shares of such class or series.
