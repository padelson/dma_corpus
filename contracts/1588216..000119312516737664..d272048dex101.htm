Terms of the Transaction

 

Section 2.1. _Agreement to Purchase and Sell Interests_. For the consideration
hereinafter set forth, and subject to the terms and provisions herein
contained, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase from
Seller, the Interests.

Section 2.2.  _Purchase Price_. The Base Purchase Price consists of (i) Six
Hundred Four Million Forty-Six Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty-Seven and No/100
Dollars ($604,046,857) in cash or other immediately available funds (the "Cash
Purchase Price"), and (ii) 14,980,362 shares of Parent Common Stock (the
"Parent Shares"). The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment both
prior to, and after, Closing as set forth herein. The Parent Shares issued to
Seller at the Closing shall be subject to adjustment in the event of stock
split, combination, re-classification, recapitalization, exchange, stock
dividend, or other distribution payable in Parent Common Stock with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock that occurs prior to Closing and shall be
issued in the name of Seller. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Base
Purchase Price was derived based on the aggregate Allocated Values of the
Properties as set forth on _Annex A_.

Section 2.3. _Adjustments to the Base Purchase Price_.

 

(a) At Closing, the Cash Purchase Price to be paid by the Buyer Parties at
Closing shall be:

 

(i) without duplication, reduced by the sum of (A) the amount, if any, of
Indebtedness of the Company described in clause (i) of the definition of
Indebtedness

 



18  and outstanding as of Closing, (B) the amount of any Transaction Expenses
outstanding as of Closing, (C) the amount of Suspended Funds that are not held
by the Company and that are attributable to the period prior to the Effective
Date, (D) the aggregate amount, if any, of adjustments for Property Costs
under Article XII hereof which result in a credit to Buyer and (E) an amount
equal to the Deposit, plus any interest thereon, which the Bank will deliver
to Seller in accordance with Joint Instructions delivered to the Bank
immediately prior to Closing; and

 

(ii) increased by the aggregate amount, if any, of adjustments for Property
Costs under Article XII hereof which result in a credit to Seller.

(b) The amount resulting after making the reductions and increases outlined
above shall be referred to as the "Adjusted Cash Purchase Price". The
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price shall be further adjusted after the Closing in
accordance with Article XII to update adjustments for Property Costs under
Article XII that were estimated for purposes of Closing.

(c) At Closing, the number of Parent Shares to be issued to Seller shall
be reduced by (i) the Indemnity Escrowed Shares to be delivered to the Escrow
Agent at Closing, and (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
calculated by dividing the sum of (A) the Defect Amounts, if any, and (B) the
Allocated Value of any Property excluded pursuant to Section 7.1, if any, in
each case, for which an adjustment to the number of Parent Shares should be
made pursuant to Article VII or Article VIII hereof by the Adjustment Per
Share Price. Any fractional shares resulting from such calculation shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole share. The number of Parent Shares resulting
after making the reductions outlined above shall be referred to as the
"Adjusted Parent Shares". 

Section 2.4. _Payment of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price_. The Cash Purchase
Price shall be payable as follows:

 

(a) As of the Execution Date, (i) Buyer, Seller, and Citibank, N.A. (the
"Bank") shall have executed an escrow agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall have
paid the amount equal to $59,945,852 (such amount being herein called the
"Deposit") into an interest bearing joint control account (the "Deposit
Account") to be established by Buyer and Seller at the Bank and requiring the
written authorization of a representative of each party for the disbursal of
funds therefrom ("Joint Instructions"). The Deposit shall bear interest at the
rate established by Bank. In the event the transaction contemplated hereby is
consummated in accordance with the terms hereof, the Deposit plus the earned
interest shall be applied to the Cash Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer at
the Closing, and Buyer and Seller shall deliver Joint Instructions to the
Bank to deliver, and the Bank shall deliver to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in Dollars to an account designated in writing by
Seller to the Bank, an amount equal to the Deposit plus interest
earned thereon. In the event this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Seller
in accordance with Section 11.1 below, the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer
or retained by Seller as provided in Article XI. If the Deposit is paid
to Buyer, or if Buyer receives credit for same against the Cash Purchase
Price paid at Closing, such payment, or credit, shall be in the amount of the
Deposit plus the amount of earned interest. All interest earned on the Deposit
Account shall be treated as income of Buyer for all Tax purposes.

 



19 (b) At the Closing, (i) Buyer shall deliver to Seller, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in Dollars to an account designated in writing
by Seller to Buyer, an amount equal to the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price as
calculated in accordance with Section 2.3(a), (ii) Buyer will deposit stock
certificates for the Indemnity Escrowed Shares in an escrow account (the
"Indemnity Escrow Account") with the Bank as the source of payment for the
indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Article XIII hereof and the
terms of a customary escrow agreement (the "Indemnity Escrow Agreement")
containing the applicable terms of this Section 2.4(b) and Section 13.8, which
agreement is otherwise consistent with the terms of this Agreement
and provides for a release of the Indemnity Escrowed Shares (other than those
distributed to Buyer pursuant Section 13.8(b) or subject to outstanding
claims) on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, (iii)
Buyer will cause to be paid to the Persons entitled thereto, all of the
Indebtedness of the Company described in clause (i) of the definition of
Indebtedness as set forth in the payoff letters delivered by Seller hereto,
(iv) Buyer will cause to be paid to the Persons entitled thereto, the
Transaction Expenses as set forth in the invoices delivered by Seller pursuant
hereto (provided that Transaction Expenses payable to employees and other
service providers shall be paid at the time required pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the agreements providing for such obligations); and (v)
Parent shall deliver the Adjusted Parent Shares as set forth in Section
10.3(b). Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer
shall treat any amounts it pays relating to Transaction Expenses pursuant to
this Section 2.4(b) as part of the Cash Purchase Price (and any adjustment
thereto) for U.S. federal income and any other applicable Tax purposes (and
therefore included in the basis of the Properties acquired for such purposes)
and will not take any tax deduction for such amounts.

CompanyÂ’s independent auditors (the "Audited Financial Statements"), and (ii)
the unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and the related
statements of income and cash flows of the Company for the six month period

financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of
the dates thereof and for the periods covered thereby, in each case except as
disclosed in the Interim Financial Statements or the Audited Financial
Statements (or in the notes thereto). Since June 30, 2016, the Company has not

24 Section 4.11. _Pending Proceedings_. Except as set forth in Section 4.11
of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no Proceedings pending or, to SellerÂ’s
Knowledge, threatened in writing, against or affecting the Company or any of
the Properties. There are no Proceedings pending or, to SellerÂ’s Knowledge,
threatened, in which the Company is or may be a party affecting the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or any Transaction Document by the Company or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by the
Company. The Company is not subject to or otherwise bound by any material and
unsatisfied judgment, order, consent order, injunction, decree or writ of or
with any Governmental Entity, other than any Permitted Encumbrances.

 

Section 4.12. _Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth in Section 4.12 of
the Disclosure Schedule, to SellerÂ’s Knowledge, the Properties and the
Company, with respect to the Properties, have been during the CompanyÂ’s period
of ownership of the Properties, and are currently in material compliance with
all Applicable Laws. The Company has not received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person that the Properties or the Company are
in material violation of, or have materially violated, any Applicable Laws. To
SellerÂ’s Knowledge, the Company, or, where Properties are not operated by the
Company, the operator of the Properties, possesses all material Permits
necessary for it to own, lease or operate (if applicable) the Properties and
to carry on its business as now conducted, all such Permits are in full force
and effect and there has occurred no material default under any such Permit.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller or the Company,
nor the consummation by Seller or the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will result in a material violation or material breach of, or
constitute a default (or give rise to a right of termination or cancellation)
of any material Permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.12 does
not relate to Taxes, which are the subject of Section 4.13, or Applicable
Environmental Laws, which are the subject of Section 4.27.

Section 4.13.  _Taxes_.

(a) The Company has filed all Tax Returns that it was required to file, and
all such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all material respects.

(b) All Taxes owed by the Company (whether or not shown or required to

assets of the Company that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged
failure) to pay any Tax.

 

(c) The Company has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party, and all
Forms W-2 and 1099 required with respect thereto have been properly completed
and timely filed.

 

(d) There are no claims or disputes concerning any Tax liability of the
Company pending or, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, threatened. No adjustment to
Tax has been proposed in writing (and none is pending) by any Governmental
Entity in connection with any Tax Returns filed by the Company. No waiver of
any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for
the assessment of, any Tax affecting or which may be expected to affect the
Company or the Properties in any

 



25  manner which is materially adverse is currently in force. No written claim
has been made by any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company
does not file Tax Returns that the Company is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction and no such claim has been threatened in writing and
received by the Company.

 

(e) The Company is and has always been treated as either an entity disregarded
as separate from its owner or a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax

income Tax purposes.

 

(f) None of the Properties is subject to any tax partnership as defined in
Section 761 of the Code.

 

(g) The Company is not a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement. The
Company (i) has not been a member of an any affiliated group within the
meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code filing a consolidated federal income
Tax Return or any similar group defined under a similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. law (other than of a group the common parent of which is

(h) The Company is not or has never been a party to any "listed transaction,"
as defined in Section 6707A(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 

Section 4.14. _Contracts_. To SellerÂ’s Knowledge, all Material Contracts are
included on Section 4.14 of the Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in
Section 4.14 of the Disclosure Schedule, to SellerÂ’s Knowledge: (i) each
Material Contract, assuming due execution and delivery by the other
counterparties thereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company and, to SellerÂ’s Knowledge as of the Execution Date, the other
counterparties thereto, in each case in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Applicable Laws affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally
and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (ii) the Company has not
received any written notice of the CompanyÂ’s default or breach of any Material
Contract, the resolution of which is currently outstanding.

any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of

of their respective ERISA Affiliates other than in accordance with Part 6 of

Gas Properties for purposes of inspecting same. Buyer agrees to comply fully
with the rules, regulations and instructions issued by the Company, its
Affiliates or the Third-Party Operators regarding the actions of Buyer while
upon, entering or leaving the Properties. Buyer shall have reasonable access
to the Properties to conduct, or cause to be conducted, an investigation of
the Properties in order to determine whether any Environmental Defects exist,
which shall be limited to performing an inspection and assessment of the
physical and environmental condition of the Properties and an evaluation of
their compliance with Applicable Environmental Laws (a "Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment") with respect to all or any portion of the Properties;
_provided however_ , that BuyerÂ’s right of access, inspection and assessment
shall not entitle Buyer to operate equipment or conduct testing or sampling
of any kind. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Buyer conducts a
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and any written

 



37  report prepared by a Third Party environmental consultant in connection with
the Site Assessment recommends a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (as
defined in the applicable ASTM International Standards) based on specific
surface conditions identified during the Phase I Environmental Assessment with
respect to a specific Property or Properties, Buyer may submit a written
request to Seller that Buyer be allowed to conduct a Phase II Environmental
Site Assessment on such Property or Properties (any Phase I or Phase II
Environmental Site Assessment individually a "Site Assessment"). Seller shall
have the right to grant or deny such a request for a Phase II Environmental
Site Assessment described in the preceding sentence at SellerÂ’s sole
discretion, but if Seller denies such a request, Buyer shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to exclude from this transaction the Property
or Properties for which the Phase II Environmental Site Assessment was
recommended by providing Seller a written notice to such effect at any time
during the Examination Period, and at Closing, the Allocated Value of all such
Properties for which Seller denied the request for a Phase II Environmental
Site Assessment, if so excluded pursuant to this Section 7.1, shall be
deducted from the Parent Shares to be issued at Closing by Buyer to Seller. If
Closing does not occur, upon the written request of Seller or Company, Buyer
shall furnish, free of costs, to Company or Seller with a copy of any written
report prepared by or for Buyer related to any Site Assessment of the
Properties as soon as reasonably practical after BuyerÂ’s receipt of such
request. All environmental reports prepared by or for Buyer shall be
maintained in strict confidence and for use solely in connection with the
evaluation of the Properties. Except for the obligations to provide
reports to the Company or Seller as set forth in the preceding sentence, if
Closing does not occur, (1) Buyer shall promptly return to the Company or
destroy all copies of the records, reports, summaries, evaluations, due
diligence memos and derivative materials related thereto in the possession or
control of Buyer or any of BuyerÂ’s representatives and (2) such reports shall
not be disclosed to any other party. The obligations set forth in the two
immediately preceding sentences shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

Section 7.2. _Exculpation and Indemnification_. If Buyer exercises rights
of access under this Article VII or otherwise, or conducts examinations or
inspections under this Section or otherwise, then (a) such access, examination
and inspection shall be at BuyerÂ’s sole risk, cost and expense and Buyer
waives and releases all claims against Seller, its Affiliates, other working
interest owners in the Properties, Third-Party Operators, and the respective
members, managers, directors, employees, officers, attorneys, contractors and
agents of all of the foregoing Persons (collectively the "Inspection
Indemnitees") arising in any way therefrom or in any way related thereto or
arising in connection with the conduct of the Inspection Indemnitees and (b)
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Inspection Indemnitees
from any and all claims, actions, causes of action liabilities, losses,
damages, fines, penalties, costs or expenses (including, without limitation,
court costs, consultantsÂ’ and attorneysÂ’ fees) of any kind or character
(collectively, "Damages"), or Liens for labor or materials, arising out of or
in any way connected with, Buyer or its representativesÂ’, access to the
Properties or the Company Records, or any examination or inspection, of the
Properties or the Company Records. THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION
SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION,
LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE
(INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE
OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT) OF AN INSPECTION INDEMNITEE.

designee, as appropriate, using the form of assignment attached hereto as

41 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4, (i) Seller or
the Company may take, in the sole discretion of Seller or the Company, any
actions to cure or attempt to cure any Defects so long as Seller bears all
costs, expenses and liability incurred with respect to such cure or attempted
cure of any such Defects and (ii) in the event of an emergency or risk of
loss, damage or injury to any person, property or the environment, Seller or
the Company may take such action as reasonably necessary and shall notify
Buyer of such action promptly thereafter. Further, Buyer acknowledges that
the Company owns undivided interests in certain of the Properties with respect
to which it is not the operator, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions
of the other working interest owners (including any Third-Party
Operators) who are not the Company shall not constitute a breach of the
provisions of this Section 7.4, and no action required pursuant to a vote of
working interest owners shall constitute a breach of the provisions of this
Section 7.4 so long as the Company voted (or Seller caused the Company to
vote) its interest in such a manner that complies with the provisions of this
Section 7.4. Requests for approval of any action restricted by this Section
7.4 shall be delivered to the person designated in Section 15.1 to receive
notices on behalf of Buyer whom shall have full authority to grant or deny
such requests for approval on behalf of Buyer.

 

Section 7.5. _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement,
except to the extent modified herein, will remain in full force and effect;
_provided, however_ , that, subject to the provisions of Section 7.9, upon
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, and for a period of
one-year following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, not make disclosure to third parties of any confidential or proprietary
information relating to the Company or the Properties, except with the prior
consent of Buyer or as required by Applicable Law, except to the extent that
such information (a) is generally available to and known by the public
through no fault of Seller or any of its Affiliates or (b) is lawfully
acquired by Seller or any of its Affiliates from and after the Closing from
sources which are not known to Seller to be prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation; _provided,
further_ , that nothing shall prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from using
their knowledge or mental impressions of such information or their general
knowledge of the industry or geographic area in the conduct of their
respective businesses following Closing.

 

Section 7.6. _Officer and Director Resignation_ _and Releases_. At the
Closing, Company shall deliver to Buyer and Seller (a) resignations of the
officers of Company in the form and substance attached hereto as Exhibit
7.6(a), such resignations to be effective immediately upon the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) subject to the
provisions of Section 7.7 releases among (i) all officers of the Company, (ii)
the Company, and (iii) Seller and its Affiliates (and their respective
officers, managers and members), releasing each other party from any and all
claims of such Person against the other party, substantially in the form and
substance attached hereto as Exhibit 7.6(b).

 

Section 7.7. _Indemnification of Managers and Officers_.

 

(a) After Closing, neither Buyer nor the Company nor the CompanyÂ’s members
shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Governing Documents of the
Company or manage the Company in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of persons who at and any time prior to the Closing Date
were members, managers, officers, employees or agents of the Company or which
would affect any

 



42  elimination from liability of any such Persons. After Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company to, honor any indemnification arrangements between
the Company and any of its members, managers, officers, employees or agents.
To the extent not already in existence, member, manager and officer
indemnification agreements in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 7.7 will be
executed by the Company in favor of each of the CompanyÂ’s members, managers,
officers, employees or agents prior to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event any claim or claims are asserted or made
pursuant to the indemnification rights set forth in this Section 7.7, all
rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until the disposition of any and all such claims. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether a personÂ’s conduct complies with
the applicable standard of conduct shall be made by independent legal counsel
selected by any such member, manager, officer, employee or other agent and
reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company will purchase a six (6) year directorsÂ’
and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (a "Tail
Policy") covering the managers and officers of the Company who are currently
covered by any existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance or
fiduciary liability insurance policies applicable to the Company and Buyer
will take no action which would interfere with the benefit of such Tail Policy
during such term.

 

Section 7.8. _Taxes_.

 

(a) _Tax Treatment_. The Parties agree to treat the purchase and sale of the
Interests for federal income Tax purposes as a purchase and sale of all of
the assets of the Company, other than the Excluded Properties.

(b) _Tax Filings_. From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause the Company to file with the appropriate taxing authorities the
applicable Tax Returns for Taxes included in the definition of Property Costs
that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date and pay the Taxes
required to be reflected on such Tax Returns as due and owing (provided that
to the extent such Taxes relate to the periods from and after the Effective
Date, promptly following the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller any such
Taxes, but only to the extent such amounts have not already been accounted for
under Section 2.3 or Article XII). Buyer shall cause the Company to file with
the appropriate taxing authorities the applicable Tax Returns for Taxes
included in the definition of Property Costs that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date and pay the Taxes required to be reflected on such Tax
Returns as due and owing; _provided, however_ , to the extent such Taxes
relate to the periods prior to the Effective Date, promptly following the
filing of such Tax Returns, Seller shall pay to Buyer any such Taxes, but only
to the extent such amounts have not already been accounted for under Section
2.3 or Article XII; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that Seller
is required by applicable Tax law to file a Tax Return with respect to such
Taxes after the Closing Date which includes all or a portion of a Tax period
for which Buyer is responsible for such Taxes, Seller shall file such Tax
Return and pay the taxes reflected on such Tax Return and following SellerÂ’s
request, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller all such Taxes allocable to the
period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Effective Date (but

 



43  only to the extent that such amounts have not already been accounted for
under Section 2.3 or Article XII), whether such Taxes arise out of the filing
of an original return or a subsequent audit or assessment of Taxes. Seller
shall be entitled to all Tax credits and Tax refunds which relate to any Taxes
allocable to any Tax period, or portion thereof, ending before the Effective
Date (determined in accordance with Section 7.8(c)). To the extent that the
Company receives any Tax refund or credit with respect to Taxes for which
Seller is responsible, Buyer shall cause the Company to immediately pay such
amount to Seller to the extent the Base Purchase Price has not been increased
pursuant to Section 2.3 or Article XII on account thereof.

(c) _Allocation of Taxes_. Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Company and its assets for
any period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, in the
case of income or franchise Taxes, and before the Effective Date in the case
of all other Taxes (except to the extent such Taxes are Transfer Taxes or are
accounted for under Section 2.3 or Article XII). Buyer shall be responsible
for all Taxes attributable to the ownership or operation of the Company and
its assets for any period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing
Date, in the case of income or franchise Taxes, and on or after the Effective
Date in the case of all other Taxes. Ad valorem, property, severance,
production and similar Taxes assessed against the Company and its assets with
respect to any Current Tax Period, but excluding ad valorem, property,
severance production or similar Taxes which are based on quantity of or the
value of production of Hydrocarbons, shall be apportioned between Seller and
Buyer as of the Effective Date with (i) Seller being obligated to pay a
proportionate share of the actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax
Period determined by multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Current Tax Period prior to
the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
the Current Tax Period and (ii) Buyer being obligated to pay a proportionate
share of the actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined
by multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days (including the Effective Date) in the Current Tax Period on
and after the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in the Current Tax Period. As described in Article XII, ad valorem,
property, severance, production and similar Taxes which are based on quantity
of or the value of production of Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned between
Seller and Buyer based on the number of units or value of production actually
produced, as applicable, before, and at or after, the Effective Date. In the
event that Buyer or Seller makes any payment for which the other Party is
responsible under this Section 7.8 and such payment has not been taken into
account in Section 2.3 or Article XII, such other Party shall reimburse
the paying Party promptly but in no event later than ten (10) Days after the
presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which
the paying Party is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of the reimbursement.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. No Transfer Tax will be collected at Closing from Buyer
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If,
however, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is later
deemed to be subject to Transfer Tax, for any reason, Buyer agrees to be
solely responsible for, and shall

 



44  indemnify and hold Seller harmless, for any and all Transfer Taxes due by
virtue of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Buyer
shall timely remit such Transfer Taxes. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate
with each other in demonstrating that the requirements for exemptions, if any,
from such Transfer Taxes have been met.

 

(e) _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(i) No later than thirty (30) days after Closing, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer an allocation of the Base Purchase Price and assumed
obligations among the Properties in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"). Buyer shall have twenty (20) days from the receipt of the
Purchase Price Allocation or any update thereto to review and comment on the
Purchase Price Allocation. Seller and Buyer shall thereafter use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree upon the Purchase Price Allocation. The
Purchase Price Allocation shall be consistent with the allocation set forth
on _Annex A_ , taking into account any adjustments to the Base Purchase Price.
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Purchase Price
Allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code following any
applicable adjustments to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement.
Seller shall provide Buyer with any such updated Purchase Price Allocation,
and Buyer shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the Purchase Price
Allocation or any update thereto to review and comment on such adjustments to
the Purchase Price Allocation, after which Seller and Buyer shall reasonably
agree on such adjustments. Seller and Buyer shall report the transactions
contemplated hereby on all Tax Returns (including Form 8594 and all other
information returns and supplements thereto required to be filed by the
parties under Section 1060 of the Code) in a manner consistent with
such Purchase Price Allocation.

(ii) If, notwithstanding Section 7.8(e)(i), Seller and Buyer do not agree on
the Purchase Price Allocation or any adjustment thereto, Seller shall
promptly engage a firm experienced in such matters and reasonably acceptable
to Buyer, to conduct an appraisal and determine the fair market value of the
Properties consistent with the allocation set forth on _Annex A_ taking into
account any adjustments to the Base Purchase Price. The cost of such appraisal
shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. Seller and Buyer
agree to allocate the Purchase Price among the Properties and report the
transactions contemplated hereby on all Tax Returns (including Form 8594 and
all other information returns and supplements thereto required to be filed by
the parties under Section 1060 of the Code) in a manner consistent with the
values of the Properties as so appraised.

(iii) Neither Seller nor Buyer shall take, or shall permit any of their
respective Affiliates to take, any position inconsistent with the allocation
under Section 7.8(e) on any Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do so
by Applicable Laws or a "determination," within the meaning of Section
1313(a)(1) of the Code.

 



45 (f) _Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Return of or relating to the Company and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes of or relating to the Company. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon any other PartyÂ’s request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Each Party agrees (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by a Party, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii)
to give any other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, each Party shall allow the other Party the option of
taking possession of such books and records prior to their disposal. The
Parties further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any taxing authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated.

 

(g) _Notification of Audit_. Until the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing upon receipt by Seller of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the income, properties or
operations of Seller that reasonably may be expected to relate to or give rise
to a Lien on the assets of the Company that would not be released at Closing.
Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties in writing upon receipt of
notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the
Purchase Price Allocation. No Party shall settle any tax audit or
tax litigation involving Taxes of or relating to the Company that affects the
Tax liability of any other Party without such other PartyÂ’s approval, which
may not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(h) _Characterization of Certain Payments_. Any payments made to any party
pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall constitute an adjustment of the Base
Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by each Party on
their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by law.

 

Section 7.9. _Press Releases_. Unless consultation is prohibited by Applicable
Law, Buyer and Seller shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation
(but no approval thereof shall be required in any event).

Section 7.10. _Books and Records_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer Parties any Company Records that
are in its possession or under its control, subject to Section 7.10(b).

(b) Seller may retain the originals of those Company Records relating to Tax
and accounting matters and provide Buyer with copies of such Company Records.
Seller may retain copies of any other Company Records.

 



46 Section 7.11. _Name Change and Logo_. Promptly after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall make the filings required in the CompanyÂ’s jurisdiction of
organization to eliminate the name "Silver Hill" and any variants thereof from
the name of the Company. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) make all other
filings (including assumed name filings) required to reflect the change of
name in all applicable records of Governmental Entities and (ii) eliminate the
use of the name "Silver Hill" and variants thereof from the Properties, and,
except with respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall
have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to any
Seller or any of its Affiliates. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any
direct or indirect costs or expenses resulting from the change in use of name,
and any resulting notification or approval requirements.

 

Section 7.12. _HSR Filing_. If a filing is required under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable and in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Execution Date, Seller, Parent and Buyer or their ultimate
parent entity will file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department
of Justice, as applicable, the required notification and report forms and will
as promptly as practicable furnish any supplemental information which may be
requested in connection therewith. Seller, Parent and Buyer or their ultimate
parent entity will request early termination of the applicable HSR Act waiting
period and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the termination of
such waiting period as promptly as possible. Parent and Buyer will bear its
own costs and expenses relating to the compliance with this Section 7.12.
Parent shall pay the filing fees associated with any filings required under
the HSR Act.

Section 7.13. _Seller Contracts_.

 

(a) The contracts, easements and rights-of-way described on Exhibit 7.13 are
held by Seller and are used for ownership, operation, maintenance, repair or
replacement of the Oil and Gas Properties (collectively, the "Seller
Contracts"). Seller agrees to (i) assign Seller Contracts to the Company on or
before the Closing, except as provided in subsection (b) below, and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents required in connection
therewith. Upon such assignment, Seller Contracts shall be deemed to be
Properties for the purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) If (i) a Seller Contract is subject to a required consent that Seller is
unable to obtain after using commercially reasonable efforts, and (ii) there
is a provision in such Seller Contract stating that an assignment without such
required consent (A) is void or voidable, (B) causes termination of Seller
Contract to be assigned, or (C) triggers the payment of specified liquidated
damages (unless Buyer agrees to pay such specified liquidated damages), then
Seller shall not assign such Seller Contract to the Company. After Closing,
Seller shall continue to hold such Seller Contract for the economic
benefit of the Company and Buyer, for the duration of the term of such Seller
Contract unless

 



47  earlier released in writing from such obligation by Buyer, _provided_ that
if the required consent to assign such Seller Contract to the Company or Buyer
is obtained after Closing, Seller shall promptly thereafter assign such
Seller Contract to the Company or Buyer, as applicable. Buyer shall be
responsible for, and shall timely pay, any and all costs, expenses and other
amounts payable under any such Seller Contracts.

 

Section 7.14. _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

Section 7.15. _Additional Listing Application_. As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, but in any event after taking into
consideration the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange with
respect to the timing of the Additional Listing Application (as hereinafter
defined) and the supporting documents required to accompany the
Additional Listing Application, Parent shall submit to the New York Stock
Exchange an additional listing application relating to the Parent Shares (the
"Additional Listing Application") and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to secure the New York Stock ExchangeÂ’s approval of the Additional
Listing Application, subject to official notice of issuance.

Section 7.16. _Parent Share Restriction_. During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after the
Closing Date (excluding the Closing Date for purposes of calculating such
date) (the "Lock-Up Period"), Seller will not lend; offer; pledge; sell;
contract to sell; sell any option or contract to purchase; purchase any option
or contract to sell; grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase; or
otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Parent Shares
acquired pursuant to this Agreement, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Parent Shares or other securities, in cash,
or otherwise. In the interest of clarity, nothing in this Section 7.16 shall
restrict Seller from utilizing customary hedging strategies that may involve
the pledge of Parent Shares as collateral until such time as the Parent
Shares are ultimately disposed on or after expiration of the Lock-Up Period.
Nothing in this Section 7.16 shall prohibit or limit the ability of Seller to
effect any transfer of Parent Shares as a bona fide gift or gifts or any
other similar transfer or distribution that does not involve a sale or other
disposition for value so long as the transferee agrees in writing to be bound
by all the terms of this Section 7.16.

 

Section 7.17. _Company Records_. Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to Buyer all of the Company Records maintained on hardware or servers being
retained by Seller hereunder, in each case, in a form that can be loaded on a
server in a searchable and manipulative format reasonably acceptable to Buyer
as soon as practicable after Closing.

 

Section 7.18. _Financial Statements; Financing_.

 

(a) The Seller and its Affiliates shall use their Reasonable Efforts to, as
soon as practicable, provide to the Buyer (i) the audited statements of
revenues over direct operating expenses of the Acquired Properties (as such
term is defined in the SHEP II MIPSA) for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014 of SHEP II, that will be prepared in accordance with GAAP and
shall include the required oil and gas disclosures, including estimates of
quantities of proved reserves as of, and a reconciliation of proved oil and
gas reserves for, each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of, and a
reconciliation

 



48  of the standardized measure of future discounted cash flows for, each of the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and (ii) unaudited statements of
revenues less direct operating expenses of the Acquired Properties for the
period from January 1, 2016 through February 26, 2016, that will be prepared
in accordance with GAAP.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company acknowledges that, following
execution of this Agreement, Parent or Buyer may enter into Financings
requiring registration under the Securities Act or the need for other
financial information relating to the Company or the Properties (such
information, together with the Audited Financial Statements, the
"Required Financial Information"). Therefore, from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing (and from time to time after Closing until such
date that is one (1) year after the Closing), the Company and the Seller will,
and, to the extent appropriate, will cause their respective Affiliates,
employees, representatives, agents and accountants to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation and assistance to Buyer, Parent
or any Financing Source as Buyer, Parent or any Financing Source may
reasonably request in connection with the arrangement or consummation of one
or more Financings, including, without limitation, (i) providing cooperation
in connection with the Buyer PartiesÂ’ preparation of financial statements,
reports and filings relating to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement (including any pro forma financial statements of Parent or any of
its Affiliates that are derived in part from the Required Financial
Information) that Buyer or Parent have determined in good faith are required
under Applicable Laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation,
the rules and regulations of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, (ii)
providing information in connection with Buyer PartiesÂ’ preparation of
responses to any inquiries by regulatory authorities, including the SEC and
the New York Stock Exchange, relating to the foregoing financial statements,
reports and filings, (iii) furnishing information to Parent, Buyer and any
Financing Source with respect to the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer, Parent or such Financing Source in order to arrange, market or
consummate any such Financing, (iv) providing customary access to information
for any Financing Source to perform its due diligence in connection with any
such Financing, and causing senior management of the Company to participate in
reasonably scheduled diligence meetings in connection with any
such Financing, and (v) providing information with respect to property
descriptions of the Oil and Gas Properties necessary to execute and record a
deed of trust for any such Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, such
cooperation and assistance shall include (x) consenting to the inclusion or
incorporation by reference of the Required Financial Information in any
registration statement, offering memorandum, report or other filing of Parent
or any of its Affiliates, (y) providing Parent and its employees,
representatives, agents and external accountants, with access to, and the
right to copy, relevant books, records, files, and documentation in the
possession or under control of the Company or its employees,
representatives, agents and accountants (except for those proprietary and
confidential tax, engineering and accounting records otherwise excluded from
this Agreement), (z) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause (1) its
independent accountants to consent to the inclusion or incorporation by
reference of its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements
of the Company and its subsidiaries in any such registration statement, report
or other filing of Parent or its Affiliates, and (2) representation letters,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to its independent

 



49  accountants, to be executed and delivered to its independent accountants in
connection with obtaining any such consent from its independent accountants.
In so doing, the Company will make appropriate persons available to answer
questions as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or Parent. Parent will
promptly reimburse all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in complying
with this Section 7.18 incurred by Seller or its Affiliates or the Company.
Buyer Parties shall, jointly and severally, release, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Company, Seller and their respective Affiliates from and
against any Damages suffered or incurred in connection with the cooperation
or assistance provided in connection with this Section 7.18 or any claim
against the Seller or any of its respective Affiliates by any Financing Source
or any Financing Related Party, EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR
IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES (other than Damages
that arise from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct).

 

(c) The Seller and its Affiliates shall use their Reasonable Efforts to
provide to Buyer, prior to the Closing Date, a restatement of the Audited
Financial Statements containing footnotes prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby (except
as otherwise stated in the footnotes).

 

Section 7.19. _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, SELLER AGREES THAT NEITHER IT, NOR ANY OF ITS FORMER,
CURRENT OR FUTURE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES, MEMBERS, PARTNERS,
AGENTS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES AND AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, "SELLER RELATED
PARTIES"), SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE, ANY LENDER
PARTICIPATING IN THE FINANCING OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FORMER, CURRENT OR
FUTURE GENERAL OR LIMITED PARTNERS, STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, AGENTS,
REPRESENTATIVES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, "FINANCE
RELATED PARTIES"), NOR SHALL ANY FINANCING RELATED PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY
WHATSOEVER TO ANY SELLER RELATED PARTY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING
CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 7.18 OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN
CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, OUT OF COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE BY ANY FINANCE
RELATED PARTY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS SECTION 7.19 SHALL NOT LIMIT ANY
LIABILITY OF BUYER OR BUYER PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, each Financing Source and Financing Related Party shall be
an express third party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce,
this Section 7.19. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that, Section 17.6
notwithstanding, this provision shall be interpreted, and any action relating
to this provision, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
This Section 7.19 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by any Financing
Source and the Finance Related Parties. In no

 



50  event will Seller or any of its Affiliates have any liability of any kind or
nature to any Financing Source or any Financing Related Party arising or
resulting from any cooperation or assistance provided pursuant to Section
7.18.

Section 7.20. _Exclusivity_. Between the Execution Date and the earlier of
the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is terminated, Seller and the
Company shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, encourage, initiate, solicit or engage in any proposal or inquiry
from, or discussion or negotiation with, any Person (other than Buyer, Parent
and their respective representatives) with respect to the sale of any
Interests or the Properties (other than the sale of any Hydrocarbons in the
ordinary course of business or sales of equipment and materials that are
surplus, obsolete or replaced).

Section 7.21. _Employee Matters_.

the employment of its employees to Seller or an Affiliate (other than SHEP
II) such that the employees shall not be employed by the Company (or SHEP II)

(b) At least 10 days before the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the SHEP II MIPSA, Buyer shall notify Seller of which employees of Seller
(or an Affiliate, as set forth in Section 7.21(a)) that Buyer or its Affiliate
desires to employ on and after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the SHEP II MIPSA.

 

(c) Effective as of immediately before the Closing, the Company will terminate
or transfer all Benefit Plans sponsored by the Company.

_Article VIII._

 

BuyerÂ’s Due Diligence Examination

 

Section 8.1. _Due Diligence Examination_. From the Execution Date until 5:00
p.m. (local time in Dallas, Texas) on the thirtieth (30th) day thereafter
(the "Examination Period"), the Company shall afford Buyer and its authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the Property
Records and Properties as provided in Section 7.1 above for the purposes of
determining whether Title Defects and/or Environmental Defects (as defined
below) exist ("BuyerÂ’s Review"); _provided, however_ , that such investigation
shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt the
personnel and operations of Seller or the Company or impede the efforts of
Seller or the Company to comply with their other obligations under this
Agreement. The cost and expense of BuyerÂ’s Review, if any, shall be borne
solely by Buyer. Buyer shall not contact any of the customers or suppliers of
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in
person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the
specific prior authorization of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that BuyerÂ’s access to the Company and
Seller personnel in accordance with this Section 8.1 is being provided as an
accommodation, and shall not alter the applicability of the disclaimer set
forth in Section 5.1.

 



51 Section 8.2. _Assertion of Title and Environmental Defects_. If Buyer
discovers any Defects prior to the expiration of the Examination Period,
Buyer shall notify Seller of such alleged Defect as soon as possible, but no
later than the expiration of the Examination Period. Buyer shall provide, on
at least a weekly basis, updates as to any alleged Defects it has discovered
during the previous week, provided that such updates may be amended as
necessary until the expiration of the Examination Period. To be effective,
such notice ("Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by
Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe the
Defect in reasonable detail including the basis therefor, (iv) identify the
specific Properties to which such Defect relates, (v) include the Defect
Amount as determined by Buyer in good faith, (vi) with respect to any
Environmental Defect, reference to the specific section of all Applicable
Environmental Laws of which the Company is in breach, violation or non-
compliance, and (vii) include Reasonable Documentation supporting BuyerÂ’s
assertion of such Defect. Any matters that may otherwise constitute Defects,
but of which Seller has not been specifically notified by Buyer in compliance
with the foregoing requirements prior to the expiration of the Examination
Period, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit BuyerÂ’s right to recover for
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.29. It
being expressly understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary in this Agreement, BuyerÂ’s sole and exclusive rights and remedies
with respect to any matter that constitutes a Defect, or any other matter
arising in connection with title to, or the environmental condition of or any
environmental liability with respect to, the Properties shall be those set
forth in this Article VIII EVEN IF SUCH DEFECT, MATTER, CONDITION OR
LIABILITY IS CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT
OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER OR ITS
AFFILIATES, and Buyer shall not be entitled to refuse to close (other than
pursuant to Section 9.1(d)), to indemnification under Article XIII, or any
other right or remedy with respect to any Defect or such other title or
environmental matter; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit BuyerÂ’s
right to recover for breach of the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 4.29.

Section 8.3. _Title Defect Amount_. _Annex A_ , as prepared by Buyer and
agreed to by Seller, shows the Allocated Value assigned to the Properties.
With respect to each Title Defect that is not cured on or before the Closing,
the number of Parent Shares to be issued at Closing shall be reduced, subject
to this Article VIII, by reference to the Title Defect Amount with respect to
such Title Defect Property. The reduction in the number of Parent Shares shall
be determined in the aggregate as described in Section 2.3(c). The Property
affected by such uncured Title Defect shall be a "Title Defect Property." The
"Title Defect Amount" resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

(a) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(b) if a Title Defect is a deed of trust, mortgage or pledge that is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title
Defect Property;

 

(c) if a Title Defect as to any Well or Lease represents solely a negative
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for any such Well or
Lease and

 



52  (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on Exhibit A or Exhibit B
for such Well or Lease, then the Defect Amount shall be equal to (1) the
product of the Allocated Value of such Well or Lease multiplied by (2) a
fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the "Net Revenue
Interest" percentage stated on Exhibit A or Exhibit B for such Well or
Lease minus (II) the actual Net Revenue Interest of such Well or Lease, and
the denominator of which is (y) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated
on Exhibit A or Exhibit B for such Well or Lease; provided that if the
Title Defect does not affect the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on
Exhibit A or Exhibit B for such Well or Lease throughout its entire productive
life, the Defect Amount determined under this Section 8.3(c) shall be reduced
to take into account the applicable time period only;

(d) if a Title Defect solely constitutes a reduction in the number of Net
Mineral Acres as to any Lease (or portion thereof), then the Defect Amount for
such Title Defect shall be equal to the product of (1) the Net Mineral Acre
price therefor _multiplied by_ (2) the remainder of (x) the number of Net
Mineral Acres purported to be included in such Undeveloped Lease as set forth
on Exhibit A _minus_ (y) the actual number of Net Mineral Acres included in
such Lease after giving effect to such Title Defect;

(e) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Oil and Gas Property of
a type not described in Section (a) through (d) above, the Defect Amount shall
be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Oil and Gas
Property so affected, the portion of the CompanyÂ’s interest in the Oil and
Gas Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title
Defect, the potential present value economic effect of the Title Defect over
the life of the affected Oil and Gas Property, the values placed upon the
Title Defect by the Parties, the estimated capital and operational costs and
expenses (or reduction or increases thereof) attributable to the CompanyÂ’s
Working Interest, and such other factors as are necessary to make
an evaluation and determination of such value;

(f) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Defect
Amounts attributable to Title Defects for an Oil and Gas Property shall not
exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Property (after giving
effect to any applicable adjustments due to prior Title Defects).

Section 8.4. _Defensible Title_. "Defensible Title" means, as of the
Effective Date, such title and ownership by the Company that, subject to and
except for Permitted Encumbrances:

(a) entitles the Company to receive a Net Revenue Interest in any Well (as to
all currently producing formations for such Well) or Lease (as to all depths
set forth on Exhibit A for such Lease), that is not less than the Net Revenue
Interest percentage

 



53  shown for such Well or Lease in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, except, in each case
of subsections (i) and (ii) of this subsection (a), (A) any decreases in
connection with those operations in which the Company may elect after the
Execution Date to be a non-consenting co-owner (B) any decreases resulting
from reversion of interest to co-owners with respect to operations in which
the Company elects, after the Execution Date, not to consent, (C) any
decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment, after the Execution
Date, of pools or units and (D) any matters as otherwise expressly stated in
Exhibit A or Exhibit B;

 

(b) obligates the Company, in the aggregate, to bear a Working Interest in any
Well (as to all currently producing formations for such Well) or Lease (as to
all depths set forth on Exhibit A for such Lease) no greater than the Working
Interest shown for such Well or Lease in Exhibit A or Exhibit B with respect
to such Well or Lease, except (i) as expressly stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit
B, (ii) any increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to
defaulting co-owners under applicable operating agreements or Applicable Law
and (iii) increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase
in the CompanyÂ’s Net Revenue Interest;

(c) as to any Lease (or portion thereof), as to all depths set forth on
Exhibit A for such Lease, entitles the Company, in the aggregate, to the
number of Net Mineral Acres in and to such Lease (or portion thereof) as set
forth therefor on Exhibit A; and 

(d) is free and clear of any deed of trust, mortgage or pledge.

 

Section 8.5. _Permitted Encumbrances_. "Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean (A)
Liens for Taxes which are not yet delinquent or which are being contested in
good faith by appropriate Proceedings; (B) Liens created under the terms of
the Leases, Easements, or Contracts, (C) materialmanÂ’s Liens, warehousemanÂ’s
Liens, workmanÂ’s Liens, carrierÂ’s Liens, mechanicÂ’s Liens, vendorÂ’s Liens,
repairmanÂ’s Liens, employeeÂ’s Liens, contractorÂ’s, operatorÂ’s Liens,
construction Liens and other similar Liens arising in the ordinary course of
business that, in each case, secure amounts or obligations not yet delinquent
(including any amounts being withheld as provided by Applicable Law), or if
delinquent, being contested in good faith by appropriate actions; (D) required
third party consents to assignments and similar agreements unless the failure
to obtain such consents would void the transfer or terminate a material right
under a Contract, Easement, Lease, or Permit; (E) any consents required in
connection with the assignment of Seller Contracts contemplated by Section
7.13; (F) all Royalties if the net cumulative effect of such burdens do not,
individually or in the aggregate, reduce the CompanyÂ’s Net Revenue Interest in
the applicable Oil and Gas Property below that shown in Exhibit A or B, as
applicable; (G) the terms of any Lease, Contract, Easement, unit agreement,
pooling agreement, operating agreement, production sales contract, division
order and other contract, agreement or instrument applicable to the
Properties, including provisions for penalties, suspensions or forfeitures
contained therein, to the extent that the terms thereof do not materially
detract from the use, operation or ownership of the Properties (as operated as
of Effective Date), reduce the CompanyÂ’s Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral
Acres in the applicable Oil and Gas Property below that shown in Exhibit A or
B, as applicable, or increase the CompanyÂ’s Working Interest in
the applicable Oil and Gas Property above that shown in Exhibit A or B, as
applicable, without a corresponding increase in Net Revenue Interest; (H)
rights of reassignment

 



54  arising upon the expiration or final intention to abandon or release any of
the Properties; (I) any easement, right of way, surface use agreement,
covenant, servitude, permit, surface lease, condition, restriction, and other
rights included in or burdening the Properties for the purpose of surface or
subsurface operations, roads, alleys, highways, railways, pipelines,
transmission lines, transportation lines, distribution lines, power lines,
telephone lines, removal of timber, grazing, logging operations, canals,
ditches, reservoirs, and other like purposes, or for the joint or common use
of real estate, rights of way, facilities and equipment, in each case, to the
extent recorded in the applicable Governmental Entity recording office as of
the Effective Date or that does not materially detract from the use, operation
or ownership of the Properties subject thereto or affected thereby (as
operated as of Effective Date); (J) all Applicable Laws and rights reserved
to or vested in any Governmental Entities (i) to assess Tax with respect to
the Properties, the ownership, use or operation thereof, or revenue, income or

franchise, grant, license or permit, or by any provision of Applicable Law, to
terminate such right, power, franchise grant, license or permit or to
purchase, condemn, expropriate or recapture or to designate a purchaser of
any of the Properties, (iii) to use such property in a manner which does not
impair the use of such property for the purposes for which it is currently
owned and operated as of the Effective Date or (iv) to enforce any
obligations or duties affecting the Properties to any Governmental Entity
with respect to any franchise, grant, license or permit; (K) any other Liens,
defects, burdens or irregularities which are based solely on (i) a lack of
information in the CompanyÂ’s files or of record or (ii) the inability to
locate an unrecorded instrument of which Buyer has constructive or inquiry
notice by virtue of a reference to such unrecorded instrument in a recorded
instrument (or a reference to a further unrecorded instrument in such
unrecorded instrument), if no claim has been made under such unrecorded
instruments within the last ten (10) years; (L) any Liens, defects,
irregularities or other matters which are expressly waived (or deemed to have
waived), cured, assumed, bonded, indemnified for or otherwise discharged at

production purchased by virtue of such call on production; (N) Liens created
under deeds of trust, mortgages and similar instruments by the lessor under a
Lease covering the lessorÂ’s surface and mineral interests in the land covered
thereby to the extent such mortgages, deeds of trust or similar instruments
(i) do not contain express language that prohibits the lessors from entering
into an oil and gas lease and (ii) no mortgagee or lienholder of any such
deeds of trust, mortgage and similar instrument has, prior to the end of the
Examination Period, initiated foreclosure or similar proceedings against the
interest of lessor in such Lease nor has the Company received any written

instrument; (O) lack of a division order or an operating agreement covering
any Property (including portions of a Property that were formerly within a
unit but which have been excluded from the unit as a result of a contraction
of the unit) or failure to obtain waivers of maintenance of uniform interest,
restriction on zone transfer or similar provisions in operating agreements
with respect to assignments in the CompanyÂ’s chain of title to the Property
unless there is an outstanding and pending, unresolved claim from a third
party with respect to the failure to obtain such waiver; (P) the treatment or
classification of any horizontal Well as an allocation well that crosses more
than one Lease or leasehold tract, including (i) the failure of such Leases
or leasehold tracts as to such Well to be governed by a common pooling or unit
agreement, or subject to a production sharing agreement or similar agreement,
whether in whole or in part, and (ii) the allocation of Hydrocarbons
produced from such well among such Leases or leasehold tracts based upon the

 



55  length of the "as drilled" horizontal wellbore open for production, the
total length of the horizontal wellbore, or other methodology that is intended
to reasonably attribute to each such Lease or leasehold tract its share of
such production; and (Q) Liens which (i) do not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially detract from the value of the Properties subject thereto
or affected thereby or materially interfere with the operation, maintenance,
repair, replacement, and/or use of the Properties subject thereto or affected
thereby, or (ii) are of a nature that would be reasonably acceptable to
prudent owner or operator of crude oil and natural gas assets and facilities
of a type similar to the Properties.

Section 8.6. _Title and Environmental Defects_. "Title Defect" shall mean a
defect exists that (A) causes Seller to not have Defensible Title to the Oil
and Gas Properties and (B) for which a Defect Notice has been timely and
otherwise validly delivered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and
shall not be asserted as, a Title Defect: (1) defects or irregularities
arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization or variation in
corporate or entity name; (2) defects or irregularities that have been cured
or remedied by the applicable statutes of limitation or statutes for
prescription, including adverse possession and the doctrine of laches or which
have existed for more than twenty (20) years and no affirmative evidence
shows that another Person has asserted a superior claim of title to the
Properties; (3) defects or irregularities in the chain of title consisting of
the failure to recite marital status in documents or omissions of heirship
proceedings; (4) the absence of any lease amendment or consent by any royalty
interest or mineral interest holder authorizing the pooling of any leasehold
interest, royalty interest or mineral interest, and the failure of Exhibit A
to reflect any lease or any unleased mineral interest where the owner thereof
was treated as a non-participating co-tenant during the drilling of any wells;
(5) any defect arising out of lack of survey or lack of metes and
bounds descriptions, unless a survey is expressly required by Applicable Law;
(6) any gap in the chain of title unless affirmative evidence shows that there
is a superior chain of title as evidenced by an abstract of title, title
opinion or landmanÂ’s title chain or runsheet; (7) any defect arising from
prior oil and gas leases relating to the lands burdened by the Leases that are
terminated but are not surrendered or released of record; (8) future
adjustments in acreage, Working Interest and Net Revenue Interest as a result
of pooling or unitization of the Leases; (9) references in the chain of title
to unrecorded agreements, unless affirmative evidence shows that there is a
superior chain of title as evidenced by an abstract of title, title opinion
or landmanÂ’s title chain or runsheet; and (10) Permitted Encumbrances.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Title Defect may be asserted with respect to
the Properties listed on Exhibit G, to the extent that any such Title Defect
arises from the failure of the Company to hold record title to such Properties
in accordance with the provisions of the joint operating agreements set forth
on Exhibit G. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each Title
Defect that is not cured on or before the Closing (other than a Title Defect
caused by Seller or the Company), there shall be no adjustment to the number
of Parent Shares to be issued at Closing, if the Title Defect Amount does not
exceed $150,000 (the "Title Defect Threshold"), it being expressly understood
that if any single Title Defect Amount exceeds the Title Defect Threshold, the
entire amount of such Title Defect Amount shall be included in the calculation
of any applicable adjustment to the number of Parent Shares to be issued at
Closing pursuant to Section 8.8(a).

 



56 Section 8.7. _Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) The term "Environmental Defect" means a condition existing on the
Effective Date with respect to any of CompanyÂ’s operations on the Properties
that (i) is identified by the Site Assessment conducted by or on behalf of
Buyer, and (ii) causes such Property (or Company with respect to such
Property) not to be in compliance with Applicable Environmental Laws or to be
subject to a remedial or corrective action obligation under Applicable
Environmental Laws; _provided, however_ , the following matters shall be
excluded from and in no event constitute an "Environmental Defect": (a) the
presence or absence of NORM, (b) plugging and abandonment obligations or
liabilities, or (c) the physical condition of any surface or subsurface
production equipment (including water or oil tanks, separators or other
ancillary equipment) except with respect to equipment (x) that causes or has
caused any environmental pollution, contamination or degradation where
remediation is presently required (or if known or confirmed, would be
presently required) under Applicable Environmental Laws or (y) the use or
condition of which is a violation of Applicable Environmental Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each Environmental Defect that
is not cured on or before the Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the
Parent Shares to be issued at Closing if the Environmental Defect Amount does
not exceed $150,000, it being expressly understood that if any single
Environmental Defect Amount exceeds $150,000, the entire amount of such
Environmental Defect Amount shall be included in the calculation of any
applicable adjustment to the Parent Shares to be issued at Closing pursuant to
Section 8.8(a).

 

(b) The "Environmental Defect Amount" shall mean the reasonable cost to
investigate, remediate and take any corrective action in the most cost-
effective manner, incorporating the least stringent clean-up standards that,
based upon the use classification of the subject Property, are allowed by the
applicable Governmental Entity and under Applicable Environmental Law and
that do not prevent the continuation of the current use of the Property.

Section 8.8. Base Purchase Price Adjustments for Defects.

(a) If the Company and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to whether
(i) an Environmental Defect exists or the Environmental Defect Amount
attributable to such Environmental Defect or (ii) a Title Defect exists or the
Title Defect Amount attributable to such Title Defect, the provisions of
Article XVI shall be applicable.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the product of the adjustment to the number of Parent Shares to be issued at
Closing, as applied to all Defects for which an adjustment is to be made,
multiplied by the Adjustment Per Share Price does not exceed two and one-half
percent (2.5%) of the Base Purchase Price, then no adjustment to the number
of Parent Shares to be issued at Closing shall occur. If the product of the
adjustment to the number of Parent Shares to be issued at Closing which would
result from the above provided for procedure as applied to all Defects for
which an adjustment is to be made multiplied by the Adjustment Per Share Price

termination shall relieve any Party from liability for any damages for a
Willful and Material Breach of a representation or warranty hereunder or a
Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation hereunder
or intentional and knowing fraud that would constitute common law fraud with
respect to the representations and warranties hereunder.

 

(b) In the event that (i) Buyer is entitled to terminate this Agreement under
(A) Section 11.1(b)(i) and Seller is in material breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, (B)

of the SHEP II MIPSA and (ii) Buyer has performed or is ready, willing and
able to perform all of its agreements and covenants contained herein which
are to be performed or observed at Closing, then Buyer, at its sole option,

expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, incurred by Buyer in enforcing
such right of specific performance) or (B) may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(i), Section 11.1(c) or Section 11.1(b)(iii), as

or failure by Seller, provided that, unless such breach or failure by Seller
was a Willful and Material Breach or constituted knowing and intentional
fraud hereunder that would constitute common law fraud with respect to the
representations and warranties hereunder, Buyer may not recover amounts in
excess of an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Base Purchase Price (it
being understood by the Parties that such amount is in addition to, and not
in lieu of, the obligation of Seller to instruct the Bank to return the
entirety of the Deposit to Buyer as required hereunder).

 

(c) In the event that (i) Seller is entitled to terminate this Agreement under
(A) Section 11.1(b)(i) and either Buyer Party is in material breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, (B)

validly terminated the SHEP II MIPSA under Section 11.1(d) of the SHEP II
MIPSA and (ii) Seller has performed, or is ready, willing and able to perform
if Buyer Parties would perform the obligations under Section 10.3, all of its
agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be performed or

specific performance of the terms of this Agreement by Buyer and Parent in
lieu of termination (plus the recovery from the Buyer Parties of all costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, incurred by Seller in
enforcing such right of specific performance) or (B) may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(i), Section 11.1(d) or Section
11.1(b)(iii), as applicable, in which case the Parties shall promptly execute
and deliver Joint Instructions instructing the Bank to disburse the entirety
of the Deposit to Seller as liquidated damages for such termination, unless
such breach or failure by Buyer was a Willful and Material Breach or
constituted knowing and intentional fraud that would constitute common law
fraud with respect to the representations and warranties hereunder, in
which case Seller may seek additional damages.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated under Section 11.1 under
circumstances other than those described in Section 11.2(b), Section 11.2(c)
or Section 11.2(e) or if Closing does not occur for any reason other than as
set forth in Section 11.2(b), Section 11.2(c) or Section 11.2(e) then the
Parties shall promptly execute and deliver Joint Instructions instructing the
Bank to disburse the entirety of the Deposit to Buyer, and no Party hereunder
shall have any further obligations to the other Party except to the extent
provided in those provisions hereof that under Section 11.2(a) expressly
survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



66 (e) In the event that Seller is entitled to terminate this Agreement
under Section 11.1(b)(i) because of the failure of Buyer to close in the
instance where, as of the Termination Date, (i) all of the conditions in
Section 9.1 (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived by Buyer), (ii) Seller is
ready, willing and able to perform all its obligations under Section 10.2 if
Buyer Parties would perform the obligations under Section 10.3, and (iv) Buyer
nevertheless elects not to or is not able to Close, then, in either such
event, Seller, at its option, (A) shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms of this Agreement by Buyer and Parent in lieu of termination (plus
the recovery from the Buyer Parties of all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, incurred by Seller in enforcing such right of

11.1(b)(i), in which the Parties shall promptly execute and deliver Joint
Instructions instructing the Bank to disburse the entirety of the Deposit to
Seller as liquidated damages for such termination.

 

(f) SellerÂ’s retention of the Deposit under Section 11.2(e) shall constitute
liquidated damages hereunder, which remedy shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to Seller for any breach or failure of any representation,
warranty or covenant of any Buyer Party contained in this Agreement (including
any Buyer PartyÂ’s failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein). THE PARTIES
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO SELLER OCCASIONED BY THE
FAILURE OF THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A FAIR
AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE A PENALTY.

 

(g) If either Buyer or Seller elects to seek specific performance pursuant to
Section 11.2(b), Section 11.2(c) or Section 11.2(e), respectively, the Party
electing specific performance (the "Electing Party") must deliver notice in
writing to the other Party (the "Non-Electing Party") of the Electing
PartyÂ’s election to seek specific performance within ten (10) days counted
from and after the Termination Date (or, if earlier, the date on which the
Electing Party became entitled to seek such remedy under Section 11.2(b) or
Section 11.2(c), as applicable). When the Electing Party elects to seek
specific performance pursuant to Section 11.2(b), Section 11.2(c) or Section
11.2(e), the Deposit shall be held by the Bank until a non-appealable final
judgment or award on the Electing PartyÂ’s claim for specific performance is
rendered, at which time the Deposit shall be distributed as provided in the
judgment or award resolving the specific performance claim. The Non-Electing
Party hereby agrees, without any requirement of proof of immediate,
irreparable, or actual damages, not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to enforce compliance
with the covenants and agreements of the Electing Party under this Agreement
to close the transactions contemplated hereby subject to the terms hereof. The
Electing Party shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with seeking an injunction or injunctions to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Subject to Section 11.2(f) (it
being understood to the extent Seller validly 

 



67  terminates the Agreement in circumstances described in Section 11.2(c) or
Section 11.2(e) and is entitled to retain the Deposit, Seller shall not also
be entitled to seek specific performance, as SellerÂ’s retention of the
Deposit would be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller), the
Parties agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
11.2(g), including by the institution of a court proceeding, the Electing
Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to it under this Article XI in the event that the
remedies provided for in this paragraph are not available or otherwise are
not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 11.2(g) shall require
the Electing Party to institute any Proceeding for (or limit the Electing
PartyÂ’s right to institute a Proceeding for) specific performance prior or as
a condition to exercising any termination right under this Article XI, nor
shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this paragraph restrict
or limit SellerÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this
Article XI.

Section 11.3. _Return of Information_. Within ten (10) Business Days following
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and representatives to, at BuyerÂ’s option,
return to Seller or destroy all Confidential Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement), subject to the provisions of Section 4 of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to retaining copies in archival or
back-up computers or other electronic storage and retaining copies for
purposes of complying with Applicable Law or government regulation.

_Article XII._

to the Cash Purchase Price shall be made between Buyer and Seller so that:

(a) Buyer will bear all Property Costs which are incurred by the Company or by
Seller (to the extent they directly or indirectly benefit or relate to the
Company), in the operation and development of the Properties on or after the
Effective Date (all such Property Costs incurred on or after the Effective
Date but prior to the Closing Date shall be added to the Cash Purchase Price)
to the extent such Property Costs are paid with cash on hand at the Company as
of the Effective Date or cash contributed to the Company by Seller after the
Effective Date or otherwise paid by Seller, and Buyer will receive all
proceeds (net of applicable Taxes) which are attributable to the Properties
and which are accrued on or after the Effective Date.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 12.4 below, Seller will bear all Property
Costs which are incurred in the operation and development of the Properties
before the Effective Date and Seller will receive all proceeds (net of
applicable Taxes) which are attributable to the Properties and which are
accrued before the Effective Date.

 

(c) It is agreed that, in making such adjustments:

 

(i) Ad valorem, property, severance, production and similar Taxes will be
allocated in accordance with Section 7.8(c);

 



68 (ii) casualty losses shall be handled in accordance with Article XIV; and 

(iii) no consideration shall be given to the local, state or federal income
Tax liabilities of any party.

 

Section 12.2. _Initial Adjustment at Closing_. At least five (5) days before
the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer a statement (the "Initial
Settlement Statement") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 12.2 showing
SellerÂ’s computations of (a) the amount of the adjustments provided for in
Section 12.1 and based on amounts which prior to such time have actually been
paid or received by Seller, (b) the amount of the adjustments provided for in
Article VIII, if any, and (c) the amount of the adjustments provided for in
Section 2.3(a)(i)(A), Section 2.3(a)(i)(B) and Section 2.3(a)(i)(C). Buyer
and Seller shall attempt to agree upon such adjustments prior to Closing,
subject to further adjustment under Section 12.3 below, provided that if
agreement is not reached, SellerÂ’s computation shall be used at Closing.
Without duplication of adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price contemplated in
Section 12.1, if the amount of adjustments so determined which would result in
a credit to Buyer exceed the amount of adjustments so determined which would
result in a credit to Seller, Buyer shall receive a credit at Closing for the
amount of such excess, and if the converse is true, then the amount to be paid
by Buyer to Seller at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such
excess.

Section 12.3. _Adjustment Post Closing_. On or before ninety (90) days
after Closing, Seller shall prepare a "Final Settlement Statement" and
deliver same to Buyer setting forth any additional adjustments to the Cash
Purchase Price not reflected in the Initial Settlement Statement (whether the
same be made to account for expenses or revenues not considered in making the
adjustments made at Closing, or to correct errors made in the adjustments made
at Closing) or confirming SellerÂ’s view that no additional adjustments are
required. Buyer will assist Seller in the preparation of the Final Settlement
Statement by providing Seller with any data or information reasonably
requested by Seller. The Final Settlement Statement shall become final and
binding upon the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt
thereof by Buyer, unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement to
Seller prior to such date. In order to be valid, any such notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement
so asserted. Any such disagreements will be resolved in accordance with
Article XVI. If the amount of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price as set forth on
the Final Settlement Statement exceeds the amount of the Adjusted Cash
Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then Buyer shall pay to Seller in cash the
amount of such excess within five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement
Statement is agreed to or otherwise becomes final in accordance with this
Section 12.3. If the amount of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price as set forth
on the Final Settlement Statement is less than the amount of the Adjusted Cash
Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash the
amount of such deficit within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Settlement Statement is agreed to or otherwise becomes final in accordance
with this Section 12.3.

 

Section 12.4. _No Further Adjustments_. Following the adjustments under
Section 12.3, no further adjustments shall be made under this Article XII.
Should any Property Costs be charged to (or received by) Seller or Buyer after
the earlier of (i) the conclusion of such adjustments under Section 12.3 or
(ii) ninety (90) days after Closing, the same shall be

 



69  forwarded to and borne by Buyer and Company, regardless of the periods to
which the same relate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 12.4 shall
not affect Buyer PartiesÂ’ right to indemnification under Section 13.2(d).

_Article XIII._

 

Indemnification

Section 13.1. _Indemnification by Buyer Parties_. From and after the Closing,
Buyer Parties shall, jointly and severally, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective owners, members,
directors, officers, managers, employees, insurers and, in each case, their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees")
from and against any and all Damages (individually, a "SellerÂ’s
Indemnified Claim" and collectively, "SellerÂ’s Indemnified Claims") which are
suffered or incurred by any of Seller Indemnitees or to which any of Seller
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not
such Damages relate to any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a
result of, or are connected with:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Buyer Parties in this Agreement or in the certificates delivered pursuant to
Section 10.3(c) hereto (without giving effect to any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifications limiting the scope of such representation or
warranty);

(b) the operation of the Company and the Properties prior to and after the
Effective Date, or the ownership of the Company, except to the extent that
Seller has agreed to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section
13.2(a);

 

(c) the condition of the Properties before, on or after the Effective Date,
regardless of whether such condition or events giving rise to such condition
arose or occurred before, on or after the Effective Date, except to the extent
that Seller has agreed to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section
13.2(a); and

 

(d) any breach of any of BuyerÂ’s or ParentÂ’s covenants, obligations or
agreements contained in this Agreement that survive the Closing; and

(e) any Taxes for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section 7.8.

 

THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATIONS BY THE BUYER PARTIES SHALL
APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH
CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR
EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE
NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY
NOT INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (ii)
STRICT LIABILITY, OR (iii) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER
RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

 



70 Section 13.2. _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Closing,
Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, Parent and their
respective Affiliates and each of their respective members, directors,
officers, managers, employees, insurers and, in each case, their respective
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and
against any and all Damages (individually a "BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claim" and
collectively "BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims") which are suffered or incurred by
any of Buyer Indemnitees or to which any of Buyer Indemnitees may otherwise
become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-
party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are connected with:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Seller or the Company in this Agreement or in the certificates delivered
pursuant to Section 10.2(b) hereto (without giving effect to (i) any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications limiting the scope of
such representation or warranty, _provided_ , _however_ , that this Clause
(i) shall not apply to any reference to Material Contract therein, or (ii) any
update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have
been made on or after the date of this Agreement);

 

(b) any breach of any of (i) SellerÂ’s covenants, obligations or agreements
contained in this Agreement that survive the Closing or (ii) the CompanyÂ’s
covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement that survive
the Closing and arising prior to the Closing;

 

(c) any Indebtedness of the Company described in clauses (i), (iv) or (v) in
the definition of Indebtedness arising prior to the Closing and outstanding
as of the Closing Date or Transaction Expenses incurred prior to the Closing
Date which were not specifically included and counted such that they reduced
the Cash Purchase Price on a dollar-for-dollar basis;

 

(d) any Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 7.8;

 

(e) any Excluded Properties;

 

(f) the injury or death of any person to the extent arising out of or relating
to the ownership or operation of the Properties by the Company prior to
Closing; and

(g) any contamination or condition that is the result of the CompanyÂ’s off
site transport or disposal, or arrangement for transport or disposal, of any
hazardous substance from the Properties that occurred prior to Closing or are
attributable to the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to Closing.

 

Section 13.3. _Survival of Provisions_. Except with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.27, which shall expire
upon the Closing and be of no further force or effect, all representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement and in the certificates
delivered pursuant to Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.1(c) hereto shall survive
the Closing until 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date, at which time such representations and
warranties shall expire and be of no further force or effect, except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.29 which shall survive

 



71  the Closing until 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the date that is two (2) years
after the Closing Date; _provided_ , that any representation or warranty the
breach or inaccuracy of which is made the basis of a claim for
indemnification hereunder will survive solely with respect to such claim until
such claim is resolved if a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as
applicable, delivers notification to the indemnifying party of such claim in
accordance with this Article XIII prior to the date on which such
representation or warranty would otherwise expire hereunder. The respective
covenants, obligations and agreements of Seller, the Company and Buyer Parties
made in this Agreement will survive the Closing until the date on which such
covenant, obligation or agreement expressly terminates or expires, or if no
such period is specified, indefinitely; _provided, however_ , that Section
13.2(c), Section 13.2(f) and Section 13.2(g) shall expire on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing. Section 13.2(b) shall expire at Closing
with respect to any breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement by Seller
or the Company arising prior to the Closing other than those set forth in
Section 7.3, Section 7.4(a) (provided that, to the extent any breach of
Section 7.4(a)(i) is a result of the CompanyÂ’s, or any of its AffiliatesÂ’,
actions or omission in its operations of the Properties, such party shall
only be liable to the extent its actions or omissions constituted gross
negligence or willful misconduct), Section 7.4(b), Section 7.7, Section 7.8,
Section 7.13(a), Section 7.19, and Section 7.21, which shall survive for one
(1) year with respect to claims for breach thereof that are delivered in
writing to Seller prior to the expiration of such one (1)-year period, and in
the case of Section 7.20, which shall survive for a period of four (4) years
after the Closing with respect to claims for breach thereof that are delivered
in writing to Seller prior to the expiration of such four (4)-year period.

 

Section 13.4. _Limitations_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, Seller shall have no liability under Section
13.2(a) for any individual Damage that does not exceed $200,000 (and such
Damage shall not be applied towards the Indemnity Deductible) and Seller shall
have no liability under Section 13.2(a) until the aggregate amount of
otherwise indemnifiable Damages thereunder exceeds a deductible (not a
threshold) of 3% of the Base Purchase Price (the "Indemnity Deductible"), and
then Seller shall be liable for only the amount by which the total of such
Damages exceeds such deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything
to the contrary in the Agreement, the limitations set forth above shall not
apply to Damages under Section 13.2(a) that arise from or as a result of, or
are directly or indirectly connected with an inaccuracy in, or a breach of,
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1 (Title to
Interests), Section 3.2 (Organization and Standing), Section 3.3 (Power and
Authority), Section 3.4 (Valid and Binding Agreement), Section
3.8 (Accredited Investor; Investment Intent), Section 4.1 (Organization and
Standing), Section 4.2 (Governing Documents), Section 4.3 (Capital Structure),
Section 4.4 (Power and Authority), Section 4.5 (Valid and Binding Agreement)
and Section 4.29 (Special Warranty) (the "Seller Fundamental
Representations").

 

(b) If the Closing occurs, the maximum aggregate amount of Damages that may be
recovered from Seller under Section 13.2(a) shall not exceed the value of the
Indemnity Escrowed Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the
contrary in the Agreement, (i) the cap limitation set forth above shall not
apply to Damages under Section 13.2(a) that arise from or as a result of, or
are connected with an inaccuracy in,

 



72  or a breach of, the Seller Fundamental Representations; (ii) in no event
shall SellerÂ’s liability under this Agreement exceed the consideration
received by Seller at the Closing, and (iii) in no event shall any Damages
arising from any breach of Section 4.29 with respect to any Oil and Gas
Property (when aggregated with any Defect Amount attributable to any Title
Defect asserted under Article VIII with respect to such Oil and Gas Property)
exceed the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Property.

(c) If the Closing occurs, Buyer shall have no liability under Section
13.1(a) until the aggregate amount of otherwise indemnifiable Damages
thereunder exceeds a deductible (not a threshold) of 3% of the Base Purchase
Price, and then Buyer shall be liable for only the amount by which the total
of such Damages exceeds such deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the deductible limitation set forth
above shall not apply to Damages under Section 13.1(a) that arise from or as
a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with an inaccuracy in, or
a breach of, the representations and warranties contained in Section 6.1
(Organization and Standing), Section 6.2 (Power and Authority), Section 6.3
(Valid and Binding Agreement), Section 6.10 (Accredited Investor; Investment
Intent), Section 6.12 (Issuance of Parent Shares), Section 6.13
(Capitalization), Section 6.15 (No Registration), Section 6.17 (NYSE
Listing), Section 6.18 (S-3 Eligibility) and Section 6.21 (Registration
Rights) (the "Buyer Fundamental Representations").

 

(d) If the Closing occurs, the maximum aggregate amount of Damages that may be
recovered from Buyer under Section 13.1(a) shall not exceed the 3% of the
Base Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the
contrary in the Agreement, the cap limitation set forth above shall not apply
to Damages under Section 13.1(a) that arise directly or indirectly from or as
a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with an inaccuracy in, or
a breach of, the Buyer Fundamental Representations.

 

(e) THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY IN SECTION 13.3 OR SECTION 13.4 SHALL APPLY
TO THE APPLICABLE LIABILITY EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITY IS CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN
PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS SO LIMITED.

 

Section 13.5. _No Commissions Owed_. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold each Buyer Party (and its partners and its and their Affiliates, and the
respective owners, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and
agents of such parties) harmless from and against any and all claims, actions,
causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including,
without limitation, court costs and attorneysÂ’ fees) of any kind or character
arising out of or resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding
alleged to have been made by, or on behalf of, Seller or, to the extent
arising or resulting prior to the Closing, the Company with any broker or
finder in connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated
hereby. Each Buyer Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller (and its
partners and its and their Affiliates and the respective owners, officers,
directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of such parties)
harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action,
liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without

 



73  limitation, court costs and attorneysÂ’ fees) of any kind or character
arising out of or resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding
alleged to have been made by, or on behalf of, Buyer Parties, with any broker
or finder in connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated
hereby.

Section 13.6.  _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

(a) For purposes of this Article XIII, the term "indemnifying Party" when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Party having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article XIII, and the term "indemnified party" when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the party having the right to be
indemnified, with respect to such Damages by the other Party pursuant to this
Article XIII.

 

(b) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 13.1 or
Section 13.2 of a third party claim for Damages or notice of the commencement
of any Proceeding against it (each a "Third Party Claim"), such indemnified
party shall, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying Party under such
Section, give notice to the indemnifying Party of the commencement of such
Third Party Claim, together with a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Article XIII. The failure of any indemnified party to give a notice of a Third
Party Claim as provided in this Section 13.6 shall not alter or relieve the
indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article XIII except to the
extent, but only to the extent, such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying Party.

 

(c) If any Third Party Claim is brought against an indemnified party and the
indemnified party gives a notice to the indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party shall have
fifteen (15) days from its receipt of the notice to notify the indemnified
party whether it admits or denies its liability to defend the
indemnified party against such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the indemnifying Party. The indemnified party is authorized, prior to and
during such fifteen (15) day period, to file any motion, answer or other
pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests
or those of the indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the
indemnifying Party, and any costs, fees or expenses incurred by the
indemnified party in furtherance of investigating, review and responding to
such Third Party Claim shall be Damages subject to indemnification hereunder.

(d) If the indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the indemnified
party against such Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and obligation
to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the indemnified party
against such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying Party to the
indemnified party of the indemnifying PartyÂ’s election to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party shall not, as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under
this Article XIII for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, in each case
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
of such claim or Proceeding (provided, however,

 



74  that the indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim if (i) the indemnifying Party fails to provide
reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to
defend such Third Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such
Third Party Claim, (ii) the Third Party Claim primarily seeks injunctive or
other non-monetary or equitable relief against the indemnified party or (iii)
the Third Party Claim relates to any criminal proceeding, indictment,
allegation or investigation). If the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
a Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim
may be effected by the indemnifying Party without the indemnified partyÂ’s
prior written consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of Applicable Laws or any violation of the rights of any Person and
no effect on any other third party claims that may be made against the
indemnified party, (B) there is a full general release in customary form of
all the claims in connection with the Third Party Claim against the
indemnified party from all parties to the Third Party Claim, and (C) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying
Party (i.e., neither the indemnified party nor any of its Affiliates are
required to perform any covenant or refrain from engaging in any activity),
and (D) the indemnified party shall have no liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim effected without its
consent.

 

(e) If the indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability to defend the indemnified party against a Third Party Claim, but is
either unable to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim as set forth
above or fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle the Third
Party Claim, then the indemnified party shall have the right to
defend against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the
indemnifying Party, with counsel of the indemnified partyÂ’s choosing, subject
to the right of the indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final
determination thereof (unless the indemnifying Party is unable to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim as set forth above). If the indemnifying
Party has not yet admitted its liability to defend the indemnified party
against a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall send written notice
to the indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the indemnifying
Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such
notice to (i) admit in writing its liability to indemnify the indemnified
party from and against the liability and either consent to or reject such
proposed settlement, in its reasonable judgment, or (ii) deny liability.
Any failure to respond to such notice by the indemnified party shall be
deemed to be an election under subsection (ii) above.

Section 13.7. Procedures for Claims Other Than Third Party Claims. A claim
for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought. The
indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the notice
to (a) cure the Damages complained of, (b) admit its liability for such Damage
or (c) dispute the claim for such Damages. If the indemnifying Party does not
notify the indemnified party within such thirty (30) day period that it has
cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the amount
of such Damages shall conclusively be deemed disputed by the indemnifying
Party hereunder. If the indemnifying Party notifies the indemnified party
within such thirty (30) day period that it disputes the claim for such
Damages, then the indemnified party may continue to seek remedies available to
it on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement. 

 



75 Section 13.8. Net Amounts; Escrow.

 

(a) Any amounts recoverable by any party pursuant to this Article XIII with
respect to any SellerÂ’s Indemnified Claims or BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims
shall be decreased by any insurance proceeds or indemnification rights
relating to such SellerÂ’s Indemnified Claims or BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claims
actually paid to such Indemnitee by any Person (other than any Affiliate of
such Indemnitee) not a party to this Agreement, net of any reasonable out of
pocket third party expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery and premium
adjustments directly attributable thereto. If any such proceeds or rights are
actually received by such Indemnitee with respect to any Damage for which such
Indemnitee has received payment under this Article XIII, such party shall
refund such payment to Seller or Buyer, as applicable. Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
agreements containing rights to indemnification for any Damages prior to
seeking indemnification under this Agreement. For federal income tax purposes,
the Parties agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective
Affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price payable to Seller hereof unless a final and
non-appealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Entity (which
shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) provides
otherwise.

(b) Buyer Indemnitees shall recover with respect to all Damages subject to
indemnification obligations owed by Seller under this Article XIII initially
from the Indemnity Escrow Account through the Escrow AgentÂ’s release of
Indemnity Escrowed Shares to Buyer with a Price Per Share equal to the amount
of Damages finally determined to be due to Buyer. To the extent the Indemnity
Escrowed Shares in the Indemnity Escrow Account have been exhausted or
distributed or are being held subject to the resolution of other outstanding
claims hereunder, Buyer Indemnitees may recover with respect to such Damages
directly from Seller, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article
XIII.

 

(c) Neither Party shall be liable for any Damage under this Article XIII to
the extent such Damage is (i) accounted for in any adjustment under Section
2.3 or (ii) recovered under any other provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document.

 

(d) Upon payment of a Damage by a Party to any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee pursuant to this Article XIII, such Party, without any further
action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such indemnitee may
have against any third Person relating to such Damage, but only to the extent
of the amount paid to such indemnitee by such Party in respect of such
Damage, and such indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with such Party, at the expense of such Party in order to enable
such Party to pursue such claims.

 

Section 13.9. No Contribution. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall not have and
shall not exercise or assert

 



76  (or attempt to exercise or assert) any right of contribution, right of
indemnity or other right or remedy against Buyer, Parent or the Company in
connection with any BuyerÂ’s Indemnified Claim under this Agreement.

_Article XIV._

 

Casualty Losses

In the event of damage by fire, explosion, wild well, hurricane, storm,
weather event or other casualty to the Properties, or if any portion of the
Properties are taken by condemnation or under the right of eminent domain,
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing, then: (a) this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; (b) there shall be no
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price; and (c) if such damage or condemnation
loss has an adverse effect on the value of the affected Properties in an
amount that exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), Seller shall, at
SellerÂ’s sole election, either (i) assign (or cause the Company to assign, if
applicable) to Buyer any property damage insurance claims (and payments with
respect thereto) related to such damage and pay any deductibles, or (ii)
repair or replace such damaged property to a condition similar to the
condition of the affected Property immediately prior to the fire or other
casualty and retain all insurance claims and payments with respect thereto.
Until the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain the existing insurance coverage,
and in the event of a casualty loss or condemnation which is not covered by
insurance, except as provided in this Section, Seller shall have no
obligation to Buyer with respect thereto; _provided that_ , if Buyer so
requests, and if Seller has not repaired the damage or replaced the affected
Property, Seller will assign any rights it may have against third parties
with respect to such damage or condemnation.

_Article XV._

Dispute Resolution

 

Section 16.1. _Disputes_. Any and all claims, disputes, or controversies with
respect to the matters expressly set forth in Section 8.8 and any notice of
disagreement with the Final Settlement Statement delivered in accordance with
Section 12.3 (all of which are referred to herein as "Disputes") shall be
resolved solely in accordance with this Article XVI, even though some or all
of such Disputes are allegedly extra contractual in nature, whether such
Disputes sound in contract, tort, or otherwise, at law or in equity, under
state or federal law, whether provided by statute or the common law, for
damages or any other relief. For the purposes of clarity, the procedures set
forth in this Article XVI shall not be utilized to resolve any matter subject
to indemnification under Article XIII.

 

Section 16.2. _Senior Management Meeting_. If a Dispute occurs that the senior
representatives of the parties responsible for the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement have been unable, in good faith, to settle or agree upon
within a period of fifteen (15) days after written notice is given of such
Dispute, Seller shall nominate and commit one of its senior officers, and
Buyer shall nominate and commit one of its senior officers, to meet at a
mutually agreed time and place not later than thirty (30) days after written
notice of the Dispute to attempt to resolve same.

 

Section 16.3. _Arbitration_. If such senior management has been unable to
resolve such Dispute within a period of five (5) days after such meeting,
such Dispute, shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the
following provisions of this Section 16.3:

 

(a) Either Party may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any such
dispute(s) conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association, to the extent that such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 16.3, by written notice to the other
Party (the "Arbitration Notice").

 

(b) The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration panel (the
"Arbitrator"), determined as follows. The Arbitrator shall be a mutually
agreeable party, and shall meet the following criteria, as applicable: (i) in
the case of Disputes relating to Title Defects, an attorney with at least ten
(10) yearsÂ’ experience examining oil and gas titles in the State of Texas,
(ii) in the case of Disputes relating to Environmental Defects, an attorney
with at least ten (10) yearsÂ’ experience practicing environmental law in the
State of Texas, and (iii) in the case of Disputes arising under Section 12.3,
an independent public accounting firm that has not been engaged by Seller,
Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates at any time in the last five (5)
years. All Disputes with respect to Title Defects shall be addressed by the
same Arbitrator, all Disputes with respect to Environmental Defects shall be
addressed by the same Arbitrator, and all disputes arising under Section 12.3
shall be addressed by the same Arbitrator. Within two (2) Business Days
following the delivery of the Arbitration

 



79  Notice, Seller and Buyer shall each exchange lists of three acceptable,
qualified arbitrators. Within two (2) Business Days following the exchange of
lists of acceptable arbitrators, Seller and Buyer shall select by mutual
agreement the Arbitrator from their original lists of three acceptable
arbitrators. If no such agreement is reached within seven (7) Business Days
following the delivery of Arbitration Notice, either Seller or Buyer may send
the original lists of the Parties and a request to the Dallas, Texas office of
the American Arbitration Association to select an arbitrator from the original
lists provided by Seller and Buyer to serve as the Arbitrator.

 

(c) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the Arbitrator,
the Parties shall submit one copy to the Arbitrator of (i) this Agreement,
with specific reference to this Section 16.3 and the other applicable
provisions of this Article XVI, (ii) each PartyÂ’s written description of the
Dispute, together with any supporting documents, and (iii) the Arbitration
Notice. Within five (5) Business Days following such submissions, each of the
Parties may submit one written response to the other PartyÂ’s submission. The
Arbitrator shall resolve the Dispute based only on the foregoing submissions.
Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have the right to submit additional
documentation to the Arbitrator nor to demand discovery on the other Party.

 

(d) The Arbitrator shall make its determination by written decision within
thirty (30) days following SellerÂ’s receipt of the Arbitration Notice (the
"Arbitration Decision"). In the event that arbitration proceedings have been
initiated in accordance with this Section 16.3, but the Arbitration Decision
has not yet been made prior to Closing, either Party shall have the right,
upon written notice to the other Party, to delay the Closing for no longer
than sixty (60) days until such time as the Arbitration Decision has been
made.

 

(e) The Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties,
without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Arbitrator shall be
bound by the rules set forth in this Article XVI. The Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the Arbitrator, but
shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants. Any such
consultant shall not have worked as an employee or consultant for either Party
or its Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration
nor have any financial interest in the Dispute.

 

(f) The Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Defects and Defect Amounts, or amounts owed
under Section 12.3 (if any), as applicable, and shall not be empowered to
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any other
matter, except as to the payment of its fees, which it may award as provided
in Section 16.3(g) below.

(g) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs
of preparing and presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and Buyer
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Arbitrator, including any
costs incurred by the Arbitrator that are attributable to the consultation of
any third party.

 



80 (h) In connection with any determination with respect to a Defect or
its associated Defect Amount pursuant to this Section 16.3, it is understood
that: (i) Buyer may not introduce or otherwise use information obtained by
Buyer after the end of the Examination Period with respect to the Defect in
dispute or its associated Defect Amount, and in no event may the Arbitrator
consider or give weight to any such information, (ii) with respect to
Environmental Defects, Buyer may not assert any violation of Applicable
Environmental Law that is not specified in the Defect Notice with respect to
the Environmental Defect in dispute, and (iii) the Defect Amount may not
exceed the amount thereof asserted by Buyer in the Defect Notice with respect
thereto.

 

(i) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 16.3
shall be decided by the Arbitrator applying the Laws of the State of Texas.

_Article XVII._

 

Miscellaneous Matters

 

Section 17.1. _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, Seller and each Buyer
Party shall execute, acknowledge and deliver, and shall otherwise cause to be
executed, acknowledged and delivered, from time to time, such further
instruments, certificates, notices, filings, division orders, transfer orders
and other documents, and each will do such other and further acts and things,
as may be reasonably necessary to carry out their obligations under this
Agreement and any other any document, certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or required by law to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 17.2. _Waiver of Consumer Rights_. Each of the Buyer Parties hereby
waives its rights under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices - Consumer
Protection Act, Section 17.41 et seq., Business and Commerce Code, a law that
gives consumers special rights and protections, and any similar law in any
other state to the extent such Act or similar law would otherwise apply.
After consultation with an attorney of each of the Buyer PartiesÂ’ own
selection, each of the Buyer Parties voluntarily consents to this waiver. To
evidence the Buyer PartiesÂ’ ability to grant such waiver, each of the Buyer
Parties represents to Seller that it (a) is in the business of seeking or
acquiring, by purchase or lease, goods or services for commercial or business
use, (b) has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
that enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) is not in a significantly disparate bargaining
position, and (d) has consulted with, and is represented by, an attorney of
each of the Buyer PartiesÂ’ own selection in connection with this transaction,
and such attorney was not directly or indirectly identified, suggested, or
selected by Seller or an agent of Seller.

 

Section 17.3. _Parties Bear Own Expenses_ _/No Special Damages_. Except as
provided in Section 7.12, each party shall bear and pay all expenses
(including, without limitation, legal fees) incurred by it in connection with
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT
TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE
CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT
OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF THE

 



81  PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS SO LIMITED. For purposes of the foregoing, actual
damages may, however, include indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or
punitive damages to the extent (i) the injuries or losses resulting in or
giving rise to such damages are incurred or suffered by a Person which is not
an Indemnitee pursuant to the Agreement or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee and
(ii) such damages are recovered against an Indemnitee by a Person which is
not Indemnitee or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee. This Section shall operate
only to limit a partyÂ’s liability and shall not operate to increase or expand
any contractual obligation of a party hereunder or cause any contractual
obligation of a party hereunder to survive longer than provided in Section
13.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing
herein shall limit SellerÂ’s ability to retain the Deposit.

 

Section 17.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Transaction Documents
contain the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations, and discussions among the Parties with respect to such subject
matter.

 

Section 17.5. _Disclosure Schedules_. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedules is
intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
the Agreement or to create any covenant unless clearly specified to the
contrary herein. Inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Schedules (a) shall
be deemed to be disclosure of such item in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedules for which the applicability of such information and
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face, (b) does not represent a
determination that such item is material nor shall it be deemed to establish a
standard of materiality, (c) does not represent a determination that such
item did not arise in the ordinary course of business, (d) does not represent
a determination that the transactions contemplated by the Agreement require
the consent of third parties and (e) shall not constitute, or be deemed to
be, an admission to any third party concerning such item. The Disclosure
Schedules include descriptions of instruments or brief summaries of certain
aspects of the Company and its business and operations. The descriptions and
brief summaries are not necessarily complete and are provided in the Schedules
to identify documents or other materials previously delivered or made
available.

 

Section 17.6. _Choice of Law, Waiver of Jury Trial_. Without regard to
principles of conflicts of law, this Agreement, and all claims of causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
State of Texas applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely
within such state and the laws of the United States of America. EACH PARTY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 17.7. _Exclusive Venue_. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction
in any action brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of
Texas with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in
relation to or in connection with this Agreement (including any claims made
in contract, tort or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the

 



82  transactions contemplated hereby), and each of the Parties agrees that any
action instituted by it against the other with respect to any such dispute,
controversy or claim (except to the extent a claim, dispute, or controversy
with respect to the matters set forth Section 8.8 and Section 12.3 is referred
to an expert pursuant to Article XVI) will be instituted exclusively in the
state or federal courts located in the State of Texas).

Section 17.8. _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

 

Section 17.9. _No Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns,
provided that neither party shall have the right to assign this Agreement,
including any indemnification rights, or any obligations or benefits
hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party first having
been obtained. Any transfer in absence of such consent shall be null and void.

Section 17.10. _Counterpart Execution_. For execution, this Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, all of which are identical and all of which
constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary for Buyer,
Seller and the Company to sign the same counterpart. This instrument may be
validly executed and delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission.

Section 17.11. _Exclusive Remedy_.

(A) THE PARTIES HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO DEFINE THEIR RIGHTS, LIABILITIES
AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUSIVELY
IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT;
AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV AND ARTICLE VI
HEREIN, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THAT THEY ARE OWED ANY DUTIES OR ARE
ENTITLED TO ANY REMEDIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT EMBODIES
THE JUSTIFIABLE EXPECTATION OF SOPHISTICATED PARTIES KNOWLEDGEABLE IN BUSINESS
AND DERIVED FROM VOLUNTARY, ARMÂ’S LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS; ALL PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO PARTY HAS ANY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH ANOTHER PARTY THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY EXPECTATION BEYOND THAT OF AN
ORDINARY BUYER AND AN ORDINARY SELLER IN AN ARMÂ’S LENGTH TRANSACTION; THAT IS,
NO FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP OR DUTY EXISTS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY
PARTY TO RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN
ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV AND ARTICLE VI HEREIN, THE PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM RELIANCE ON THE OTHER PARTY AND CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY WAIVE AND
RELEASE ANY AND ALL TORT CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION THAT MAY BE BASED UPON,
ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR
PERFORMANCE OF

 



83  THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY TORT CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING RELEASING CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, FRAUD,
FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT, AND FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT INTO THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11.2). WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING,
THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE BUYER PARTIES FOR ANY AND ALL (A) CLAIMS
RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, (B) OTHER CLAIMS PURSUANT TO OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND (C) OTHER CLAIMS RELATING TO THE PROPERTIES,
INTERESTS OR THE COMPANY AND THE PURCHASE AND SALE THEREOF (WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) SHALL BE THE RIGHTS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED(Y) PRIOR
TO CLOSING, IN SECTION 11.2 AND (Z) AFTER THE CLOSING, ARTICLE XIII, AND IF
NO SUCH RIGHT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, THEN SUCH CLAIMS ARE HEREBY WAIVED TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN
PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS SO LIMITED. EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS CONTENTS, AND SIGNS THIS AGREEMENT AS ITS
OWN FREE ACT. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WARRANTS THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY
LEGAL COUNSEL IN THIS MATTER, AND LEGAL COUNSEL HAS READ AND EXPLAINED TO EACH
PARTY THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND ITS WAIVERS AND RELEASES IN
FULL. EACH PARTY COVENANTS NOT TO SUE ON CLAIMS RELEASED OR WAIVED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH SUIT SHALL BE A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT
FOR WHICH THE NON-BREACHING PARTY MAY SEEK ACTUAL DAMAGES, WHICH SHALL INCLUDE
ATTORNEYSÂ’ FEES AND COSTS.

 

(B) UPON CLOSING, THE BUYER PARTIES SHALL ALSO BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTION
AGAINST SELLER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CONTRIBUTION CLAIM ARISING
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW) AND ANY AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS, CLAIMS
AND CAUSES OF ACTION IT MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER ARISING UNDER OR BASED ON ANY
FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, ORDINANCE, RULE OR REGULATION OR COMMON
LAW OR OTHERWISE.

Section 17.12. References, Titles and Construction.

(a) All references in this Agreement to articles, sections, subsections
and other subdivisions refer to corresponding articles, sections, subsections
and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise.

 



84 (b) Titles appearing at the beginning of any of such subdivisions are
for convenience only and shall not constitute part of such subdivisions and
shall be disregarded in construing the language contained in such
subdivisions.

 

(c) The words "this Agreement," "this instrument," "herein,"
"hereof," "hereby," "hereunder," and words of similar import refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so
limited.

 

(d) Words in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and
vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. Pronouns in masculine,
feminine and neuter genders shall be construed to include any other gender.

(e) Examples shall not be construed to limit, expressly or by implication,
the matter they illustrate.

(f) The word "or" is not intended to be exclusive and the word "includes" and
its derivatives means "includes, but is not limited to" and corresponding
derivative expressions.

 

(g) The Annexes, Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits listed in the List of
Annexes, Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits are attached hereto.

Section 17.13. _No Third-Person Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall entitle any Person other than each Buyer Party and Seller to any claim,
cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly
provided to the Persons described in Section 7.7, Section 13.1 and Section
13.2.

 

Section 17.14. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

Section 17.15.  _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Attorney-
Client Privilege_. Recognizing that Thompson and Knight LLP ("TandK") has acted as
legal counsel to Seller and certain of its Affiliates prior to the Closing,
and that TandK may act as legal counsel to Seller after the Closing, the Company
hereby expressly waives any current or future conflicts that may arise in
connection with TandK representing Seller or any of its Affiliates after
the Closing with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each of the Parties also agrees that Seller has a reasonable expectation of
privacy and privilege with respect to its communications (including, but not
limited to, any e-mail or other electronic communications using the CompanyÂ’s
systems) with TandK prior to the Closing to the extent such communications
concern this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each of the Parties likewise
agrees that third parties and their counsel with a common legal interest with
Seller also have a reasonable expectation of privacy and privilege with
respect to their communications prior to the Closing ("Common Interest
Parties"). At and after the Closing, the attorney-client privilege of the
Company with TandK with respect to such matters, and the Common Interest Parties
with their counsel shall be deemed to be the right of Seller or the
Common Interest Party respectively, and not that of the Company, and may be
waived only by Seller or Common Interest Party as to their respective
communications. Absent

 



85  the consent of Seller, the Common Interest Party, or except as required to
comply with any Applicable Law or other regulatory requirement applicable to
Buyer or its Affiliates, neither Buyer nor the Company shall have a right to
access attorney-client privileged material of the Company with respect to this
Agreement and the other documents contemplated herein and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby following the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver by the Company of
the attorney-client privilege or the obligations of confidentiality owed by
TandK to the Company with respect to matters not regarding this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (b) in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, Parent or the
Company and a third Person other than a party to this Agreement after
the Closing, (i) the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by TandK to such third Person
and (ii) to the extent any such privilege or client confidence is required to
be waived or otherwise required to be released by any Governmental Entity,
under law or pursuant to any orders, decrees, writs, injunctions, judgments,
stipulations, determinations or awards entered by or with any Governmental
Entity, none of the Company, Buyer, Parent or their Affiliates shall be in
breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document for providing information, documents, communications or client
confidences to any Governmental Entity in response to, and subject to the
requirement limitation in, the foregoing.

Section 17.16. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by an instrument in writing specifically referring to the terms to be
amended and/or modified and signed by all the Parties.

 

Section 17.17. _Waiver_. Compliance with any term or provision hereof may be
waived only by a written instrument executed by each party entitled to the
benefits of the same. No failure to exercise any right, power or privilege
granted hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege granted hereunder.
