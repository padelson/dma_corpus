ARTICLE II 
THE OFFER 

  

 2.1 _ The Offer._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Terms of Offer; Conditions to Offer._ Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the Company Shares at a price per Company Share, subject to the terms of _Section 2.1(b)_ hereof, equal to the Offer Price. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Company Shares tendered (and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Company Shares tendered) shall be subject only to: 

    

 (i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof), there be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of all then outstanding Company Shares; and 

   

 (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto. 

    

Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or
previously approved by the Company in writing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
may make any change to the terms and conditions of the Offer that (A)
decreases the Offer Price, (B) changes the form of consideration to be paid in
the Offer, (C) reduces the number of Company Shares to be purchased in the
Offer, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions to
the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, (E) amends the conditions to the
Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto so as to broaden the scope of such
conditions to the Offer or amends any other terms of the Offer set forth in
this Agreement in any manner materially adverse to the holders of Company
Shares, (F) extends the Offer in any manner other than pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of _Section 2.1(c) _ hereof or (G) amends or
waives the Minimum Condition. The conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex
A_ hereto are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived
by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to
time, in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, which may be
waived by Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the
Company. The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

  

 (b) _ Adjustments to Offer Price._ The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Merger Sub\'s acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Shares pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (c) _ Extension and Expiration of Offer._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under 

  

      

  
  

the Exchange Act); _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff, the Nasdaq or the NYSE
that is applicable to the Offer and (ii) in the event that any of the
conditions to the Offer, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth on _Annex A_ hereto, are not satisfied or waived as of
any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer for successive extension periods of ten (10) Business Days each in order
to permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this
_Section 2.1(c)_, in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Initial Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date,
as applicable; and _provided further_ , that the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii)
of this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_ hereof.

  

 (d) _ Payment for Company Shares._ Subject to the terms and conditions this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof). The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or other Taxes payable by such holder. 

  

 (e) _ Subsequent Offering Period._ Merger Sub may (but shall not be required to), and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right to, extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business days immediately following the expiration of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that in the event that more than eighty percent (80%) of the then outstanding Company Shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section 2.1(c) _ hereof), Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) of ten (10) business days immediately following the applicable expiration date of the Offer unless Parent exercises the 90% Top-Up Option pursuant to _Section 2.5_ hereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as so extended by such subsequent offering period, as promptly as practicable after any such Company Shares are tendered during such subsequent offering period. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as so extended by such subsequent offering period, shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or other Taxes payable by such holder. 

  

 (f) _ Schedule TO; Offer Documents._ As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall: 

    

 (i) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference an Offer to Purchase, or portions thereof (the " _Offer to Purchase_ "), and forms of the letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, in respect of the Offer (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and 

   

      

   

 (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of Company Shares (collectively, the " _Company Stockholders_ "). 

    

Subject to the provisions of _Section 7.2_ hereof, the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents may include a description of the determinations, approvals
and recommendations of the Company Board set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_
hereof. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in
writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub
for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents so as to enable
Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their obligations under _Section
2.1(a)_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to determine
the information regarding the Company that is necessary or reasonably
appropriate to include in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents in order to
satisfy applicable securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with

hereby agree that the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed with the
SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company
Stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Except
to the extent subsequently amended, modified or supplemented in
a subsequently filed Schedule TO or Offer Document and, with respect to any
unaudited interim financial statements included therein, subject to the same
qualifications and exceptions contained in _Section 4.7(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby agrees that the information provided

misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents prior to the

 (d) _ Rights of First Refusal._ Solely in connection with the tender and purchase of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger, the Company hereby waives any and all rights of first refusal it may have with respect to Company Shares owned by, or issuable to, any Person, other than rights to repurchase unvested shares, if any, that may be held by Persons pursuant to the grant of restricted stock purchase rights or following exercise of employee stock options. 

  

  

 2.3 _ Company Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange Act._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Composition of Company Board and Board Committees._ Effective upon the initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall exercise its rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Company Shares held by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the Company Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding Company Shares. Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the 

  

      

  

Company Board, including (at the election of Parent) either by increasing the
size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing
the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary
to enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed
to the Company Board. From time to time after the Appointment Time, the
Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals so
designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding
up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
and (iii) each committee of each such board of directors of each Subsidiary of
the Company, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable
Legal Requirements. Solely for purposes of this _Section 2.3_, any and all
members of the Company Board immediately prior to such appointments by Parent
who remain on the Company Board after such appointments by Parent shall be
referred to as " _Continuing Directors_ " and each as a " _Continuing

 (g) _ Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificates solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 3.10 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_ hereof; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 3.11 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and necessary action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

 (h) All contributions, premiums and other payments required to be made with respect to any Employee Plan have been timely made, accrued or reserved for in all material respects.

 (j) There is no suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding made, conducted or brought by a third party that has been served upon or, to the Knowledge of the Company, filed or threatened with respect to, and the Company has not been notified in writing of, any alleged infringement or other violation in any material respect by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their current products or services or other operation of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' business of the Intellectual Property Rights of such third party. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no pending or threatened claim challenging the validity or enforceability of, or contesting the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' rights with respect to, any of the Company IP. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order of any Governmental Entity that restricts or impairs the use of any Company IP, other than restrictions or impairments that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (k) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) will not result in (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries granting to any third party any rights or licenses to any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) any right of termination or cancellation under any Company IP 

  

      

  
  

Agreement, (iii) the imposition of any Lien on any Owned Company IP, except

The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) will not constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source code escrow arrangement under which the Company has deposited any material Company Source Code for any Company Product to require release of such Company Source Code. 

  

 (p) The Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' collection and dissemination of personal customer information in connection with their business has been conducted in accordance with applicable privacy policies published or otherwise adopted by the Company and its Subsidiary and any applicable Legal Requirements, except where the failure to abide by any such policy or law would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

  

 4.23 _ Insurance._ The Company and its Subsidiaries have all policies of insurance covering the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees, properties or assets, including policies of life, property, fire, workers\' compensation, products liability, directors\' and officers\' liability and other casualty and liability insurance, which the Company reasonably believes are adequate for the operation of its business. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, no notice of 

        

cancellation has been received, and there is no existing default or event
which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default, by any insured thereunder, except for such defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of
such policies and there has been no threatened termination of, or material
premium increase with respect to, any such policies.

 (a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required by Delaware Law in order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, as soon as practicable following the Appointment Time, the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger and the Company Stockholders\' Meeting. The Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable Legal Requirements, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable law, 

  

      

  

disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq.

  

 (b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, subject to the terms of _Section 7.2(b)_ hereof, the Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than with respect to the Offer). 

  

  

 7.5 _ Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Complete._ 

  

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), including using commercially reasonable efforts to: 

    

 (i) cause the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ hereto and the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled; 

  

 (ii) obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger); 

   

 (iii) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities, seek the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under applicable Legal Requirements, and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities; and 

  

 (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. 

    

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_ hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall file, as soon as may be reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, and, as soon as may be reasonably practical following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by the merger notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable foreign jurisdiction or be deemed desirable by Parent, in each case as Parent may deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (iii) supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and that Parent reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions 

  

      

  

contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), then
such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

  

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_ hereof, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock, in each case in a manner that would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent\'s Software business segment or to materially and adversely affect the benefits expected to be derived from the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger. 

  

  

 7.6 _ Access._ At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company to enable Parent to obtain all information concerning the business, including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that no information or Knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section 7.9_ hereof) shall apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.6_. 

  

 7.7 _ Notification._ 

  

  

 (a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement 

  

      

  

(as amended pursuant to _Section 7.9_ hereof) shall apply to any information
provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.7(a)_.

   

 (b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time, the Company shall use its best efforts to give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any notice or other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Appointment Time, to which the Company has Knowledge alleging any material breach of or material default under any Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) any notice or other communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Appointment Time, to which the Company has Knowledge alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger); _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and provided further, that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section 7.9_ hereof) shall apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)_. 

  

 (c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section 7.9_) shall apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.7(c)_. 

  

  

 7.8 _ Certain Litigation._ The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and shall consider Parent\'s views with respect to such stockholder litigation and shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any notice or information to Parent the provision of which the Company in good faith determines may adversely affect the Company\'s or any other person\'s attorney client or other privilege with respect to such information. 

  

 7.9 _ Confidentiality._ Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 30, 2006 (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of the execution and delivery hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended so as to permit Parent to take any action contemplated by this Agreement, including the making of any counter-offer or 

        
  

proposal as contemplated by _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ hereof
(which deemed amendment shall survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or otherwise).

   

 7.10 _ Public Disclosure._ Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with each other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) or any Acquisition Proposal, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party hereto shall be made prior to any such release or public statement. 

   

 7.11 _ Company Options; Company ESPP._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Company Options._ 

    

 (i) _ Outstanding Options That Are Not Assumed by Parent._ Parent shall not assume any, or portion of any, Company Option that (A) is held by a person who is not an employee or service provider of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent immediately after the Effective Time, as reasonably determined by Parent in its sole discretion, (B) is outstanding and vested and exercisable (after taking into account the effect of the accelerated vesting contained in this Section 7.11(a)(i) or any contract or arrangement providing for the accelerated vesting of outstanding options) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless such Company Option has an exercise price, immediately prior to the Effective Time, that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, (C) is subject to the Legal Requirements of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and/or held by an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and which Parent determines may not be converted into an Assumed Company Option (as defined in the paragraph below), (1) under the applicable laws or regulatory requirements of the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction (including by reason of a failure to obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable commercial efforts) or (2) under the generally applicable policies and practices of Parent with respect to the grant of equity awards in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction; _provided, however_ , any such Company Options that are not assumed by Parent under this subsection (C) shall be accelerated in full so that each such option is fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (D) is held by a non-employee member of the Company Board; _provided, however_ ,  that any such Company Options that are not assumed by Parent under this subsection (D) shall be accelerated in full so that each such option is fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Appointment Time, in the event that any such non-employee member of the Company Board shall leave the Company Board at the Appointment Time, and extend the post-termination exercise period for such Company Options until the earlier of the latest possible date permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations (including proposed regulations) promulgated thereunder and the date that includes the Effective Time but in no event beyond the expiration date of the Company Option, or immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the event that any such non-employee member of the Company Board shall remain on the Company Board following the Appointment Time (each, such Company Option or portion thereof, a " _Cancelled Company Option_ "). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Cancelled Company Options, each Cancelled Company Option shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Cancelled Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration less the per share exercise price of such Cancelled Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ ") (it being 

   

      

   

understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to
the Company by the holder of a Cancelled Company Option). Parent shall, or
shall cause the Company to, pay to holders of Cancelled Company Options the
Option Consideration less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payments. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

  

 (ii) _ Outstanding Company Options Assumed by Parent._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Company Options, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall assume each Company Option or portion of a Company Option that is not a Cancelled Company Option (an " _Assumed Company Option_ "). Each Company Option assumed by the Parent will continue to have, and be subject to the same material terms and conditions of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, the vesting restrictions, if applicable, except that (A) each Assumed Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Company Option outstanding at the Effective Time multiplied by a quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share Merger Consideration by (y) the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " which shall be calculated to at least five decimal places), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise price for such Assumed Company Option outstanding at the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed Company Option shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Assumed Company Option qualified as an incentive stock option at the Effective Time. The exercise price and the number of shares purchasable pursuant to each Assumed Company Option as well as the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Sections 424(a) and 409A of the Code. 

  

 (iii) _ Further Actions._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide notice (subject to reasonable review by Parent) to each holder of Company Options describing the treatment of such Company Options in accordance with this _Section 7.11_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and conditional upon the Closing, the Company Board shall make all determinations reasonably necessary under each of the Company Option Plans to accomplish the transactions contemplated by this _Section 7.11_ and if, to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). Conditional upon the Closing, the Company shall take all appropriate or necessary steps to effect the termination of the Company Option Plans as of the Effective Time, except with respect to the administration of the Assumed Company Options. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Assumed Company Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this _Section 7.11_. 

   

 (iv) _ Section 16._ The Company Board shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the deemed disposition and cancellation of the Company Options in the 

   

      

   
  

Merger. Provided that Company shall first provide to Parent the names of its
stockholders and the number of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Options which may be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and any
other information reasonably requested by Parent and relating to the same, the
Board of Directors of Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time,
take appropriate action to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act, the deemed grant of options to purchase Parent Common Stock
under the Company Options (as assumed pursuant hereto).

  

 (v) _ Form S-8._ Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form or other appropriate forms) relating to Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to assumed awards under the Company Option Plans and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause shares of Parent Common Stock, when issued upon exercise of Assumed Company Options, to be approved for quotation on the NYSE and such exchanges as Parent shall determine. 

  

 (vi) _ 409A._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions to permit holders of all Company Options that will be Cancelled Company Options, and which are subject to the penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code (the " _409A Penalty Tax_ "), to elect fixed payment terms (including payment in connection with a "change in the ownership or effective control of a corporation") for such Cancelled Company Options as permitted under the proposed regulations and related guidance under Section 409A of the Code (the " _409A Correction_ "). The 409A Correction shall be conducted in a manner consistent and compliant with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations (including proposed regulations) promulgated thereunder as well as all other applicable laws. The 409A Correction shall not by itself result in the accelerated vesting of any Company Options. After the Effective Time and before the end of the transition period under Section 409A of the Code that permits the correction of discounted stock options, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to commence an offer to modify all Company Options that will be Assumed Company Options that are subject to the 409A Penalty Tax (the " _409A Offer_ ") to increase the exercise price of such options as necessary so that such options shall not be subject to the 409A Penalty Tax. Each eligible holder of Assumed Company Options who participates in the 409A Offer and holds Assumed Company Options that are unvested at the Effective Time shall receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the aggregate increase in exercise price of such modified Assumed Company Options. The 409A Offer shall be conducted in a manner consistent and compliant with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations (including proposed regulations) promulgated thereunder as well as all other applicable laws. Parent, in its sole discretion, may permit certain holders of Assumed Company Options, which are vested at the Effective Time, to participate in a 409A Correction instead of a 409A Offer. In the event the 409A Offer is not commenced before the end of the transition period under Section 409A of the Code, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow each holder of Assumed Company Options to participate in a 409A Correction prior to the end of the transition period under Section 409A of the Code. 

    

 (b) _ Company ESPP._ At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP (each, a " _Purchase Right_ ") shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time from Parent, for each share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Purchase Right, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to the holder of such Purchase Right had such Purchase Right been 

  

      

  

exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the amount by
which the Merger Consideration exceeds the purchase price under such Purchase
Right. Within five (5) days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Company to return to participants their respective accumulated payroll
contributions not applied to the purchase of Company Common Stock under
the Company ESPP, if any. Parent agrees that from and after the Effective
Time, Continuing Employees may participate in Parent\'s employee stock
purchase plan, if any, subject to the terms and conditions of such plan.

  

  

 7.12 _ Employee Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) On or before the Appointment Time and to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, the Company shall amend any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to eliminate all installment and annuity forms of payment, and no later than ten (10) calendar days after the Appointment Time, the Company shall provide affected participants with a summary of such amendment that satisfies the requirements of 29 CFR 2520.104b-3. The Company shall adopt resolutions to terminate any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to be effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions to terminate the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably request. As soon as practicable following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who were eligible to participate in any 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in Parent\'s 401(k) plan, and shall permit each Continuing Employee to elect to roll over his or her account balance from any terminated 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any outstanding participant loans from such 401(k) plans, to Parent\'s 401(k) plan. 

  

 From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to participate in the benefit programs of Parent or the Subsidiary to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or the Subsidiary. In the U.S., Continuing Employees shall be given credit for all service with the Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries solely for purposes of determining their rate of vacation accrual under Parent\'s standard procedure, and for eligibility to participate in, and vesting of benefits under, Parent\'s 401(k) plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a U.S. Continuing Employee shall be paid severance in the event of an involuntary termination (and not for cause) from Parent during a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time in an amount calculated under the Company\'s severance policy and using such Continuing Employee\'s most recent continuous period of service with the Company and Parent through date of termination; _provided, however_ , that the rejection of an offer of employment from Parent at the same base salary shall not constitute an involuntary termination; provided, further, that this sentence shall in no way limit, restrict or otherwise affect the benefits payable to any individual under the terms of any written agreement with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (A) in effect on the date hereof and. which has been disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (B) subsequently approved by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_. Parent shall provide Continuing Employees outside the U.S. no more than the minimum credit for service with the Company or its Subsidiaries required by applicable Legal Requirements. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any U.S. group health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the Continuing 

  

      

  
  

Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each of the Continuing
Employee in the U.S. credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out of pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made.
Unused vacation days accrued by U.S. Continuing Employees under the plans and
policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall carry over to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to the extent administratively practicable, and each
such Continuing Employee shall be paid by the Company in cash for any accrued
and unused vacation days that Parent determines are not administratively
practicable to continue to honor.

  

 (b) The Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation, deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, no agreement or other arrangement between the Company and any individual shall be considered a "group" plan, program or arrangement for purposes of the preceding sentence. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and reasonable approval of Parent). 

  

 (c) The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or other communication materials to any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

  

  

 7.13 _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Appointment Time between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Appointment Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") with respect to any action, suit or proceeding commenced within six (6) years following the Appointment Time arising out of facts or circumstances occurring or existing prior to the Appointment Time. In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Appointment Time, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were covered by such provisions, except as required by Legal Requirements. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Appointment Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring (or allegedly occurring) at or prior to the Appointment Time, on terms and conditions no less favorable to the insured persons than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option: 

    

 (i) substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms and conditions no less favorable to the insured persons than the DandO Insurance that are with carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement; or 

   

    

   

   

   

   

 (ii) request, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Appointment Time, that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance program (to be effective as of the Effective Time); 

    

 _provided further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this
_Section 7.13(b)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 7.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), _provided, further,_ that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Appointment Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent may purchase a "tail" prepaid
policy on the DandO Insurance for a period of six (6) years from the
Appointment Time on terms and conditions no less favorable to the insured
persons than the DandO Insurance from carriers with the same or better rating as
the carrier of the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement. In the
event that Parent shall purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Appointment
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 7.13(b)_ for so long
as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

  

 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 7.13_. 

   

 (d) The obligations under this _Section 7.13_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.13_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.13_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirements (whether at law or in equity). 

  

 (e) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries under this _Section 7.13_ shall be joint and several. 

  

 (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle any litigation or other suit, action or proceeding to which an Indemnified Party is a party on terms obligating it to breach its obligations under this _Section 7.13_. In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall consider whether any such settlement not involving the Indemnified Party would reasonably be 

  

      

  
  

expected to have a prejudicial effect on such Indemnified Party to continue
to defend such litigation, suit, action or proceeding on his or its own
behalf.

  

  

 7.14 _ FIRPTA Certificate._ On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parent\'s obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

 (d) by the Company: 

    

 (i) in the event (A) of a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or (B) that any of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become inaccurate, in either case so as to prevent Parent and Merger Sub from consummating the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by Parent or Merger Sub or such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub are curable by Parent or Merger Sub through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ until the earlier to occur of (1) the expiration of a thirty (30) calendar day period after delivery of written notice from the Company to Parent of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable or (2) Parent or Merger Sub ceasing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy, provided that Parent or Merger Sub continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ if such breach or inaccuracy by Parent or Merger Sub is cured within such thirty (30) calendar day period); or 

  

 (ii) immediately prior to entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, provided that (A) the Company received such Superior Proposal other than as a result of a breach or violation of the terms of _Section 7.1_ hereof, (B) the Company has not breached or violated the terms of _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ hereof in connection with such Superior Proposal (or any Acquisition Proposal that was a precursor thereto), (C) subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal and authorized the Company to enter into such definitive agreement for such Superior Proposal (which authorization may be subject to termination of this Agreement), (D) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company intends to enter into such definitive agreement for such Superior Proposal, which notice shall include the most current version of such definitive agreement and the

For purposes of this _Section 9.4(b)_, the term " _Company Acquisition

 (c) _ Enforcement._ The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of _Section 9.4(b)_ hereof are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), and that, without such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ hereof, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim against the Company (i) that results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable costs and expenses of Parent (including its reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in _Section 9.4(b)_ hereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, or (ii) that results in a judgment against Parent, Parent shall pay to the Company the reasonable costs and expenses of the Company (including its reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit. Payment of the fees described in _Section 9.4(b)_ hereof shall not be in lieu of, or replacement or substitution for, damages incurred in the event of any breach of this Agreement. 

  

       

 9.5 _ Amendment._ Subject to applicable law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including _Section 2.3(c)_ hereof), this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ , that in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders without such approval.

Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.
