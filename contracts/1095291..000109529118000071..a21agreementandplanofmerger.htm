NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows: 

Article I 
THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be

"Surviving Corporation") and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and the
separate corporate existence of the Company with all its properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the
Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided
in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges,

permitted hereunder, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V (except
for any conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied on the Closing
Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions on the Closing Date
or waiver by the Party entitled to waive such conditions); provided, however,
the Closing may occur on such other date or at such other time and place as
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, further, that
documents may be delivered and exchanged at the Closing by facsimile, PDF or
other electronic means; provided, further, that if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the time of the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V (except for any
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied on the Closing Date, but
subject to the satisfaction of such conditions on the Closing Date or waiver
by the Party entitled to waive such conditions), the Closing shall occur on
the date following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder,
waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a) a date during
the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent in writing on no fewer than
three (3) Business Days' notice to the Company and (b) the second (2nd)
Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period.

Section 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, as soon as practicable following the fulfillment or waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in Article V, on the Closing Date, the parties shall

recordings, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of,
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the

of the State of Delaware or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed
upon by Parent and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers. 

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety at
the Effective Time to read as set forth in Exhibit B hereto, and, as so
amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Surviving Charter") until thereafter amended in accordance
with the DGCL and such Surviving Charter, subject to Section 4.8.

(b) The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with the DGCL and such bylaws (as so amended, the "Bylaws"),

(c) From and after the Effective Time, (i) the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case, until their respective successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Surviving Charter and the Bylaws.

Section 1.5 Conversion and Exchange of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company or Merger Sub:

(i) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Shares") (other than (x) shares of Company
Common Stock held by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent ("Excluded
Shares") and (y) shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which the
holder thereof has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to it in
writing, has demanded the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and
shall have properly exercised and perfected such holder\'s demand for
appraisal rights with respect to such shares in compliance with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares")) shall be converted into the
right to receive, in accordance with this Article I, twenty-five dollars
($25.00) in cash per share, without interest (the per share cash consideration
to be issued to the holders of such Shares, the "Merger Consideration");

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(i) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
Shares (each, a "Certificate") or Shares represented by book-entry (the "Book-
Entry Shares") (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share covered thereby upon
surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this Article I;

(iii) each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be automatically canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist; and 

(iv) each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into one (1) newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, during the period commencing on the Agreement Date and ending at the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger, issuer tender offer,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock,
then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted; provided that
the Company shall be required to comply with Section 4.2 in connection with
any such action.

Section 1.6 Company Equity Awards.

(a) Company Options. Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall assume any Company
Options or substitute for any Company Option any option for Merger Sub or
Parent equity, in connection with the Merger or any other Transactions. As of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any optionholder,
except as set forth in Section 1.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules: (i)
all Unvested Company Options outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall fully vest and become exercisable, and become Vested
Company Options, and (ii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Option shall be canceled, with each former holder of any
such canceled Company Option becoming entitled to receive, at the Effective
Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than three
(3) Business Days thereafter), in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company Option, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction
for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.9), equal to the
product of: (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of each such Company Option; and (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option; provided,
however, that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall
be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof.

(b) Company Restricted Shares.

(i) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any
holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock subject to time-based
vesting restrictions granted under a Stock Plan (a "Company Restricted Share")
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested and nonforfeitable and shall be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(ii) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any
holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock subject to performance-
based vesting restrictions granted under 

a Stock Plan (a "Company Performance Share") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable based
upon an assumed achievement of one hundred percent (100%) of the target level
of performance in each and every performance year remaining. Such vested
Company Performance Shares shall be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) Company RSUs.

(i) Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall assume any Company RSU or substitute
for any Company RSU any similar award for Merger Sub or Parent equity, in
connection with the Merger or any other Transactions.

(ii) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any
holder of Company RSUs, all Unvested Company RSUs outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become Vested
Company RSUs. In the case of Unvested Company RSUs that are subject to
performance-based vesting conditions, the number of Unvested Company RSUs that
become Vested Company RSUs shall be based upon an assumed achievement of one
hundred percent (100%) of the target level of performance in each and every
performance year remaining.

(iii) Each Vested Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time, and, in exchange
therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any
such Vested Company RSU, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable
thereafter (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.9) equal to the product of (A)
the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU; provided that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Vested
Company RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the applicable settlement date for such Vested Company RSU if required in
order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(d) Payment of Company Options and Vested Company RSUs. Parent shall take all
actions necessary so that, no later than three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time (or such later time required by the proviso included in Section
1.6(c)(iii)), the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each
holder of Employee Options and Vested Company RSUs the amounts to which such
holder is entitled as determined in accordance with this Section 1.6 through
the payroll of the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Company Subsidiary,
and shall pay to each holder of Non-Employee Options the amounts to which such
holder is entitled as determined in accordance with this Section 1.6 through
the standard accounts payable procedures of the Surviving Corporation or the
applicable Company Subsidiary. In the event that the Surviving Corporation has
insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of Company Options and
Company RSUs as of the Effective Time, Parent shall pay such amounts or
provide to the Surviving Corporation, on the Closing Date, sufficient cash to
pay such amounts. 

(e) Further Actions. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall take such actions as are
necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.6, including making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof or any administrator of a Stock Plan as may be
necessary.

Section 1.7 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No further registrations or transfers of Company Common Stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Payment Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be marked
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8 below.

Section 1.8 Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the "Payment Agent"). On or
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Payment Agent, separate and apart from its other funds,
for the purpose of exchanging Merger Consideration for Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares), cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5 with respect to such
Shares, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Restricted Shares
and the Company Performance Shares. The cash amount so deposited with the
Payment Agent is referred to as the "Payment Fund." The Payment Agent will
invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by
Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any
interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be
the property of Parent.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more
than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent) and/or (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of
the Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares
or Dissenting Shares) shall, upon (A) surrender to the Payment Agent of
Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in 

accordance with the instructions thereto, such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, and the applicable declaration for Tax
withholding purposes, or (B) compliance with the reasonable procedures
established by the Payment Agent for delivery of Book-Entry Shares, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the aggregate Merger Consideration
in respect thereof and the Certificates so surrendered and Book-Entry Shares
so transferred shall forthwith be canceled, subject to Section 1.9. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or due transfer of the Book-Entry Shares. The Payment Agent
shall accept such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Until
so surrendered or delivered, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I.

(d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in a reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may determine as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Payment Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of
such bond, if so required, shall be deemed delivery of a Certificate with
respect to the relevant Common Shares for purposes of this Article I.

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of the applicable Shares may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or the Book-Entry Shares so
transferred are registered if such Certificates shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be
properly transferred and, in each case, the Person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the Payment Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date that is one (1)
year after the Closing Date shall be delivered to or as directed by the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such holder who has not previously
complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of any such holder's claim for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any holder of any Certificate or to any other Person with respect to any
Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Payment Agent to pay
for Dissenting Shares shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon
Demand.

Section 1.9 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(each, a "Payor") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as such Payor is required to deduct or withhold and pay over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or
under any other applicable Law. Each Payor shall request from and allow
recipients of consideration a reasonable opportunity to provide documentation
establishing exemptions from or reductions of such withholdings. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by the applicable Payor in accordance with applicable Law,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Section 1.10 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by Parent.

Section 1.11 Appraisal Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 1.5(a)(i), but rather, the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the appraisal value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with
Section 1.9 with respect to such payment (and, at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any
right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraisal value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL); provided, that, if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and
payment under and to the extent set forth in and in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time),
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(without interest thereon) as provided in Section 1.5(a)(i), and such shares
shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

(b) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any
written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL or any other written communication with the Company
that relates to a demand for appraisal or payment with respect to Dissenting
Shares; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such demand; and (C)
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL with respect to the exercise or purported
exercise of 

appraisal rights; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in, at Parent's
election and expense, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment or settlement offer or settle any
such demands prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled
under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive payment of the "fair value" for such
holder's shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation after giving effect to any withholdings received by applicable Law
(but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant
to the DGCL), and such shares shall be retired and cancelled as of the
Effective Time. Any payments required to be made with respect to the
Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or, if
the Payment Fund is being administered by the Payment Agent at such time, the
Payment Agent, and the aggregate Merger Consideration (and, if applicable, the
Payment Fund) shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, as if the holder
of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the Closing Date.

Section 1.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name
of the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

(except for Permitted Liens) pursuant to a lease, sublease, license or similar
written agreement ("Real Property Lease") and (iii) has good and marketable

in respects that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 2.19(a) of the

Merger, this Agreement and the Transactions from any "fair price,"

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedules delivered by Parent to
the Company on the Agreement Date (the "Parent Disclosure Schedules"), each of
Merger Sub and Parent represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and
has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it
is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective
properties and assets except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Merger Sub
is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under Laws of the State
of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its
business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its
respective properties and assets except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
of Merger Sub and Parent is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other constituent documents, as amended to date, of

this Agreement and each other Transaction Document that either Merger Sub or
Parent is a party, the performance by each of Merger Sub and Parent of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by each of Merger
Sub and Parent of the Transactions have been duly authorized by the board of
directors of Merger Sub and managing member of Parent. No other corporate
proceedings on the part of Merger Sub or Parent are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
that either Merger Sub or Parent is a party to, the performance by either
Merger Sub or Parent of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by
either Merger Sub or Parent of the Transactions. Each of this Agreement and 

each other Transaction Document that either Merger Sub or Parent is a party to
has been duly executed and delivered by Merger Sub and/or Parent, as
applicable, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Merger Sub
and/or Parent, as applicable, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability.

Section 3.3 Non-Contravention.

(a) Neither the execution and delivery by Merger Sub and Parent of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document that either Merger Sub or Parent
is a party nor the consummation by Merger Sub and Parent of the Transactions
will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time): (i)
result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the certificate or
articles of incorporation or bylaws, or other similar organizational documents
of Merger Sub or Parent; (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or
cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the
performance required by Parent or Merger Sub under, or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of the properties or assets owned or operated by Parent or Merger Sub

filings referred to in paragraph (b) below, violate any Judgment or Law
applicable to Merger Sub or Parent, in each case, other than any such event

would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Merger Sub or Parent to consummate the Transactions (a "Parent
Material Adverse Effect").

(b) No Governmental Approval is necessary to be obtained or made by Merger Sub
or Parent in connection with Merger Sub's and Parent's execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the consummation by Merger Sub or Parent of
the Transactions, except for (i) compliance with the DGCL (including, with
respect to the filing of the Certificate of Merger), (ii) compliance with and
submission of filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and
notices required to be filed with Governmental Authorities under any Antitrust
Law, (iii) the filing with the SEC of any documents required to be filed with

with the Transactions, (iv) the approvals, filings and notifications imposed
by applicable Laws that are set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedules, and (v) such other Governmental Approvals the failure of
which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.4 No Legal Proceedings Challenging the Merger. There is no Legal
Proceeding against Merger Sub or Parent pending, or to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Merger Sub or Parent. There are no material
Judgments of any Governmental Authority or Person outstanding or in effect
against Merger Sub or Parent.

Section 3.5 Activities of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of effecting the Merger. Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the
Effective Time engage in any activities other than those contemplated by this
Agreement and has, and will have as of immediately 

prior to the Effective Time, no liabilities other than those contemplated by
this Agreement. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub
is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

Section 3.6 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Merger Sub or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, as of the
date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and at the time of
the Company Stockholders' Meeting, will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information
supplied by the Company for inclusion therein.

Section 3.7 No Other Company Representations or Warranties. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is a sophisticated purchaser, possesses such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of its investment under this Agreement. In entering into
this Agreement and each of the other documents and instruments relating to the
Merger referred to herein, Parent and Merger Sub have each relied solely upon
its own investigation and analysis, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that except for the representations and warranties set forth in Article
II (which to the extent provided for in this Agreement are subject to the
Company Disclosure Schedules and the Available Company SEC Documents), Merger
Sub and Parent hereby acknowledge and agree that: (a) neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
securityholders, controlling persons, or Representatives or any other Person,
has made or is making any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Company or Company Subsidiaries or their respective
business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations,
financial condition, prospects, projections, budgets, estimates or operational
metrics, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided
(including any statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this
Agreement and any financial statements and any projections, estimates or other
forward-looking information) provided (including in any management
presentations, information or descriptive memorandum, the Dataroom, any other
"data rooms" maintained by the Company, supplemental information or other
materials or information with respect to any of the above) or otherwise made
available to Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives or any other Person; and (b) except in the cause of Fraud, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
securityholders, controlling persons, or Representatives or any other Person
will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation or
other obligation of any kind or nature to Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person on any basis
(including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or
otherwise), resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other
distribution to Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives or any other Person, or the use by Merger Sub, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, of any
such information provided or made available or statements made (or any
omissions therefrom) to any of them by the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, 

stockholders, securityholders, controlling persons, or Representatives or any
other Person, including any information, documents, estimates, projections,
forecasts or other forward-looking information, business plans or other
material provided or made available to Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, in the Dataroom,
any other "data rooms," confidential information memoranda or management
presentations in anticipation or contemplation of the Merger or any other
Transactions.

Section 3.8 Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Merger Sub and Parent and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, Merger Sub and Parent and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives have received and may continue to
receive after the Agreement Date from the Company and its Affiliates and
Representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding
the Company and its business and operations. Merger Sub and Parent hereby
acknowledge and agree that: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Merger Sub and
Parent are familiar; (b) Merger Sub and Parent are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans); and (c) except in the cause of Fraud, Merger
Sub and Parent hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any claim against the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives with respect to any information
described in this Section 3.8, and have relied solely on the results of their
own independent investigation and on the representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants made by the Company and contained in this Agreement.
Accordingly, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledge and agree that none of the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, securityholders, controlling persons or Representatives, has
made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans (including the reasonableness of assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans) except as set forth in this Agreement and, except in the cause of
Fraud, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its Representatives not to, hold any such Person liable with respect
thereto (whether in warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict
liability) or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 3.8 serves to modify or qualify the representations of the Company
contained in Article II or the right of Parent and Merger Sub to rely thereon.

Section 3.9 Financing.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the duly executed commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, from
the Financing Sources (together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and
attachments thereto, the "Debt Commitment Letter" and together with the
Redacted Fee Letter, the "Debt Commitment Papers") and the Redacted Fee
Letter, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
the Financing Sources 

have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent and Merger Sub
for the purpose of funding the Transactions (the "Debt Financing"), and (ii)
the duly executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date
(the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt Commitment Papers,
the "Financing Commitments") from certain funds affiliated with Siris Capital
Group, LLC ("Sponsor") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, Sponsor has caused such funds to commit to invest the
amounts set forth therein solely for the purpose of funding the Transactions
(the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to
provide until such time as this Agreement is terminated, that the Company is a
third party beneficiary thereof to the extent set forth therein.

(b) As of the Agreement Date, each of the Financing Commitments (and each of
the respective obligations and commitments contained therein) is in full force
and effect and, has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect
or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and, to
Parent's Knowledge, no such withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment,
supplement or modification is presently contemplated (other than amendments,
modifications or terminations that are permitted by Section 4.15). Assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto,
each of the Financing Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Merger Sub and Parent and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Papers only, to
the Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent), the other parties thereto, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights or by general equity principles. Except for the Financing
Commitments in the form delivered pursuant to Section 3.9(a) and the Redacted
Fee Letter, as of the Agreement Date, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Financing or the
Financing Commitments that could affect the conditionality or availability of
the Financing, to which Merger Sub, Parent, Sponsor or any of their respective
Affiliates is a party. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, the accuracy of the representations and warranties in
Article II in all material respects, the compliance and performance by the
Company of its covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement in all
material respects, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, as of the
Agreement Date, (i) no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (w) make any of the
assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitments
inaccurate in any material respect, (x) constitute a default or breach on the
part of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor and (in the case of the Debt Commitment
Papers only, to the Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent) any of the other
parties thereto, under any term of the Financing Commitment, (y) result in a
failure of any condition of the Financing Commitments or otherwise cause the
Financing Commitments to be ineffective, or (z) result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to not be available at the Closing in an amount
equal to the Required Amount. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, the accuracy of the representations and
warranties in Article II in all material respects, and the compliance and
performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement in all material respects, none of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor has
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that any of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in
any of the Financing Commitments on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) none
of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor 

has any reason to believe that the full amount of the Financing will not be
available to Merger Sub on the date of the Closing and (iv) none of Merger
Sub, Parent or Sponsor have Knowledge that any of the Financing Sources will
not perform their respective obligations under the Financing Commitments or of
any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or
statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material
respect.

(c) Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the applicable
Financing Commitments and (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's
obligation to consummate the Merger (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at Closing), the aggregate net proceeds of the
Financing (including after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex,
including original issue discount flex, contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Papers), when combined with Parent's and Merger Sub's other sources of funds,
will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Merger Sub's and Parent's
obligations under this Agreement to be satisfied at or after Closing on the
terms contemplated hereby and under the Financing Commitments, including the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8, amounts
to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6, the payment of all associated fees, costs
and expenses and all other amounts, in each case, required to be paid by
Parent or Merger Sub at Closing pursuant to this Agreement, with respect to
Merger and the Financing or the Transactions, including any repayment or
refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
required in connection therewith and giving effect to the maximum amount of
flex, including original issue discount flex, contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Papers (the "Required Amount"). There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing in an amount equal to the Required Amount or
that would permit the parties thereunder to reduce the total amount of the
Financing to an amount less than the Required Amount, in each case other than
as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. Each of Merger Sub and
Parent have paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to
be paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments on or before the
Agreement Date.

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to
Closing under this Agreement (including the payment by Parent and Merger Sub
of the Required Amount) that Parent or Merger Sub obtains Debt Financing
(including, without limitation, as contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter
for or related to any of the transactions contemplated herein, but
acknowledging that the Company's right to specific performance to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded under the Equity Commitment Letter is subject to
the conditions set forth in Section 7.6(a)).

Section 3.10 Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee duly
executed by the Guarantors with respect to certain matters on the terms
specified therein. The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors
(except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by
general equity principles), and no event has occurred, which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of a
Guarantor under such Limited Guarantee. 

Section 3.11 Solvency. Neither Merger Sub nor Parent is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. Assuming the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, and after giving
effect to the Transactions, and payment of the Required Amount, the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" means that, as of any date of
determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of the assets
of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than
the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair
saleable value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay
the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, on their debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured, (c)
such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in
business or a transaction, and are not about to engage in business or a
transaction, for which such Person's and its Subsidiaries' assets, on a
consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably small capital, and (d) such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do
not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability to
pay such debts and liabilities as they mature; provided, however, for the
purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be
computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such
contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

Section 3.12 Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of Merger Sub or Parent
or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the
last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. No material amount of shares of Company
Common Stock or securities that are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
into shares of Company Common Stock are owned (directly or indirectly,
beneficially or of record) by Sponsor, Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary or controlled Affiliate of Sponsor, Parent or
Merger Sub. Merger Sub has no Subsidiaries. None of Sponsor, Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective controlled Affiliates holds any rights to acquire or
vote any material amount of shares of Company Common Stock except pursuant to
this Agreement. Prior to the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives of Parent or Merger Sub
to take, any action that would reasonably be expected to cause, Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" to be deemed an "interested
stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Other than pursuant to
this Agreement, as of the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in
each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any material contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case,
whether oral or written), pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company
would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature
than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the
Company (i) agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii)
agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal. 

Section 3.13 Certain Agreements with Management. Other than this Agreement, as
of the Agreement Date, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments,
agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company\'s
management or the Company Board, on the other hand, relating in any way to the
Transactions or the operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
after the Effective Time.

Section 3.14 Interest in Competitors. Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor do not
own any material interest, nor do any of their respective Affiliates insofar
as such Affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to Parent, Merger Sub or
Guarantor under the HSR Act, in any entity or Person that derives significant
revenues from products, services or lines of business within the Company\'s
products, services or lines of business.

Section 3.15 Broker\'s or Finder\'s Fees. Except as set forth in Section 3.15
of the Parent Disclosure Schedules, no agent, broker, Person or firm acting on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors, or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates or under the authority of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors, or any of their respective controlled Affiliates is or will be
entitled to any commission or broker's or finder's fee or commission from any
of the parties hereto in connection with any of the Transactions.

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent a
reasonably complete initial draft of a proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement") within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Agreement Date, and as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Agreement Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days
following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement to be sent to the holders of
Common Shares relating to the meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the
"Company Stockholders' Meeting") to be held to consider adoption of this
Agreement, approval of the Merger and approval of any other matters to affect
the Transactions as determined by the Parties. Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and shall furnish all information concerning Parent, Merger Sub and
their Affiliates as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested by the Company and shall otherwise
reasonably assist 

and cooperate with the Company in the preparation, filing and distribution of
the Proxy Statement, and the resolution of any comments received from the SEC.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing.
The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the later of the No-Shop Period Start Date and the date on
which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC provided that the Company
shall not be required to mail the definitive Proxy Statement until the date on
which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement or that it does not intend to review the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (the "Definitive Proxy Date").

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) the receipt of any
comments from the SEC and all other written correspondence and oral
communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement and (ii) any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information with respect thereto and, in each case of clauses
(i) and (ii), the Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. All filings by the Company with the SEC
in connection with the Transactions, including the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto and any response to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, shall be subject to the reasonable prior review and
comment of Parent, and all mailings to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Transactions shall be subject to the reasonable prior
review and comment of Parent and, in each case, the Company shall consider in
good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall not
file or mail any document relating to the Company Stockholders' Meeting or
respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that the
Company, in connection with a Change in Company Board Recommendation made in
compliance with the terms hereof may (and Parent shall comply with any request
by the Company to) amend or supplement the Proxy Statement (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to an amendment or supplement (including
by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains (i) a Change in
Company Board Recommendation, (ii) a statement of the reason of the Company
Board for making such Change in Company Board Recommendation, and (iii)
additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

Section 4.4 Company Stockholders' Meeting.

(a) Subject to Section 4.5, the Company shall, in accordance with its Company
Charter Documents and applicable Law (and regardless of whether there has
occurred Change in Company Board Recommendation), as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Definitive Proxy Date, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting for the purpose of seeking
the Company Stockholder Approval, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the later of the Definitive Proxy Date and
the No-Shop Period Start Date and (ii) subject to Section 4.5, solicit the
Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 4.5(f) and unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1, the Company shall, through
the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they vote their shares
in favor of the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation") and shall include
such Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent
that the Company Board shall have made a Change in Company Board
Recommendation as permitted by Section 4.5.

(b) The Company agrees that its obligation to hold the Company Stockholders'
Meeting pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any Change in Company
Board Recommendation by the Company Board, and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation, subject to the ability of
the Company Board to take the actions set forth in Section 4.5(f); provided,
however, that if, the Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company
Board Recommendation pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of Section
4.5, then the Company Board shall submit this Agreement to the Company's
stockholders without a recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this
Agreement as of the Agreement Date may not be rescinded or amended prior to
the termination of this Agreement), in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Company's
stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto to the extent required by applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall not adjourn, postpone or recess the Company
Stockholders' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent and shall
adjourn, postpone or recess such meeting as directed by Parent in order to
obtain a quorum or solicit additional votes (so long as such meeting is not
adjourned, postponed or recessed to a date on or after the Outside Date)
unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; provided, however, the Company
shall have the right to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting:
(i) after consultation with Parent, for not more than two (2) periods not to
exceed ten (10) Business Days each if on the date on which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is then-scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval; (ii) if on the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
then-scheduled, there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting; (iii) if the Company is required to postpone or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law, order of Governmental
Authority or a request from the SEC or its staff, (iv) after 

consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law or (v) if there has been a Change in Company Board
Recommendation and the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is
necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting in order to give the stockholders of the Company sufficient time to
evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has disseminated or
otherwise made available to such stockholders, in which case the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\' Meeting one (1) time, but only
for such period as the Company Board (or such committee) has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is necessary or
appropriate to give the stockholders of the Company sufficient time to
evaluate such information or disclosure, which in any event shall not exceed
five (5) Business Days. The Company shall not, unless required by applicable
Law or permitted in accordance with this Section 4.4, change the record date
for the Company Stockholders' Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and any postponement or adjournment of the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting shall be effected, to the extent practicable, in a manner that does
not require the Company to establish a new record date.

(d) The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable proxy solicitor of the
Company to advise Parent on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, as to
the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Company Stockholder Approval.

negotiations have been terminated other than any Excluded Party (but only for
as long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party), the Company shall
terminate such Persons' access to any data room containing the Company's or

Acquisition Proposal does not constitute or could not reasonably be expected
to result in a Superior Proposal, and (C) the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4.5, at
any time prior the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.1 and the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
in response to a written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (except to the
extent solicited or continued in accordance with Section 4.5(a) and subject to
the right to maintain discussions and negotiations with Excluded Parties), the
Company may contact the Third Person that delivered such Acquisition Proposal
and make inquiries solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition
Proposal and if the Company Board determines in good faith 

that (i) after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to result in a Superior Proposal, and (ii) after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, failure to take any of the following actions would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company may: (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and/or provide access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel,
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and such Person's Representatives); provided, however,
that if such Person is not then a party to a confidentiality agreement with
the Company, the Company and such Person enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; and provided further, that any material non-public
information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made
available to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall, to the extent
not previously provided to Merger Sub or Parent, be substantially concurrently
provided or made available to Merger Sub or Parent; and (B) engage in,
participate in or facilitate discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

(e) During the Interim Period, the Company shall promptly advise Parent in
writing, in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and shall indicate (to the extent not prohibited by any
applicable confidentiality agreement in place prior to the Agreement Date) the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms
and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal.

(f) Except as set forth in this Section 4.5(f), the Company Board shall not:
(i) (A) fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation; (B)
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, when
mailed; (C) make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer other than an unequivocal recommendation
against such offer or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
in which the Company Board or the Company indicates that the Company Board has
not changed the Company Board Recommendation; (D) if reasonably requested in
writing by Parent in a timely manner following the No-Shop Period Start Date,
fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business
Days after such request (provided, that the Company Board shall not be
required to comply with more than one (1) such request per Acquisition
Proposal or amendment thereof) or (E) approve, authorize, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable (or make any public announcement of its decision
to approve, authorize, recommend or otherwise declare advisable) the adoption
of any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement requiring the Company to abandon
the Transactions or terminate or this Agreement, excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any confidential, non-public recommendation to its Representatives
to review, consider, clarify discuss, evaluate or negotiate, any Acquisition
Proposal or any agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, subject to the obligations of the Company
set forth in this Section 4.5 (each of the actions described in clauses (A)
through (E), inclusive referred to as a "Change in Company Board 

Recommendation") or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding agreement, letter of
intent, or agreement in principle with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
including any Company Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board
may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
take any of the actions set forth in Section 4.5(f)(i)-(iii) below; provided,
however, that prior to taking any such action, the Company complies with
Section 4.5(g) of this Agreement:

(i) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to a material
fact, event, change or development that (a) arises after the Agreement Date
and was not known to the Company Board as of or prior to the Agreement Date
and (b) does not involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; and

(iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii) (and, if
applicable, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement), if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisor, constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to enter into such
definitive agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4.5(f), the
Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to Section 4.5(f)(i) or Section 4.5(f)(ii); or (ii)
terminate this Agreement (and, if applicable, enter into any Company
Acquisition Agreement) pursuant to Section 4.5(f)(iii), unless in all such
instances: (A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to
Parent (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in Company Board
Recommendation) that the Company is prepared to (x) make a Change in Company
Board Recommendation (a "Recommendation Change Notice"), or (y) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii) in response to a Superior Proposal
(a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which notice shall contain a description of
the reasons for such Change in Company Board Recommendation or, if the basis
for the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, contain a
description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including a copy of the Company Acquisition Agreement in the form to be
entered into; (B) after providing such notice, the Company shall have
negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) during the three (3) Business Days after the receipt of such notice
(it being understood 

that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification pursuant to the
foregoing clause (B) and a new period of negotiation under this clause (B) of
two (2) Business Days instead of three (3) Business Days), to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee as would permit
the Company Board to determine that the Acquisition Proposal would no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee that may be offered in
writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York Time) on the last day of
such three (3) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, and
referred to (without duplication) in clause (B) above, in a manner that would
form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and (D) the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith after the conclusion of the negotiations
provided for in clause (B) above and consideration of any changes to this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Limited Guarantee offered by Parent pursuant to clause (C) above, without
duplication, and consultation with outside legal counsel and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the Company's financial advisor that failure to effect a
Change in Company Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any material changes with respect to
events, facts and circumstances mentioned above, or material changes to the
financial terms of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior
to the Company's effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii) shall require the
Company to provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior
Proposal Notice and a new two (2) Business Day period.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 4.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from taking or disclosing a position contemplated by
Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to the Company's
stockholders to comply with applicable Law (it being agreed that a "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company\'s stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or a factually accurate
public statement by the Company that describes the Company\'s receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation); provided,
that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation unless the Company Board
reaffirms the Company Recommendation within four (4) Business Days following
any request by Parent for such reaffirmation (it being agreed that Parent may
make only one (1) such request with respect to any single such disclosure).

Section 4.6 Consents; Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
limitations set forth in Section 4.5), the parties hereto will use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions
and to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article V to be
satisfied, including using commercially reasonable best efforts to make 

or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other parties hereto and to the
extent applicable: (i) within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Agreement
Date, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act with respect to the Merger; and (ii) within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the Parties receive confirmation from such Governmental Authorities of
the jurisdictions set forth on Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, all other necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications,
registrations and notices with other Governmental Authorities under any other
Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. Each party shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to: (A) respond at the earliest practicable date to
any requests for additional information made by the U.S. Department of
Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or any other Governmental Authority
under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger; (B) act in good faith and
reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any investigation
by any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger;
(C) furnish to each other all information required for any filing, form,
declaration, notification, registration and notice under any Antitrust Law
relating to the Merger, subject to advice of such party's antitrust counsel
(excluding any documents and communications which are subject to preexisting
confidentiality agreements, the attorney client privilege or work product
doctrine or required by applicable Law or Order or by applicable Governmental
Authority not to be so disclosed); and (D) take all other actions reasonably
necessary consistent with this Section 4.6 to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. In connection with the foregoing, except
as prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by applicable Governmental
Authority, each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts: (w) to give the other party reasonable prior notice of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any investigations, proceedings, filings,
forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed communication, understanding or
agreement with any Governmental Authority, in each case under any Antitrust
Law relating to the Merger, subject to advice of such party's antitrust
counsel; (x) not to participate in any meeting or conversation, or engage in
any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings or inquiry under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger, without
giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate therein; (y) if attending a meeting, conference, or conversation
with a Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger,
from which the other party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority from participating in or attending, to keep
the other reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (z) to consult and
cooperate with the other party in connection with any information or proposals
submitted in connection with any proceeding, inquiry, or other proceeding
under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable
best efforts: (1) to avoid the entry of any Governmental Order; and (2) to
eliminate every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority so as to enable the Effective Time to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date). Any
fees and expenses (other than the attorney's, advisor's and agent's fees)
payable under the filings, registrations and declarations with Governmental
Authorities relating to the Transactions shall be borne equally by the Company
and Parent (and 

each of the Company and Parent shall make such equal payment on the date that
such filing is made).

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Merger Sub, Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions, including using commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain and maintain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from all Governmental
Authorities or other third parties and make all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with all Governmental Authorities or other third
parties that are necessary to consummate the Merger.

(c) For purposes of Section 4.6(a), "commercially reasonable best efforts"
shall include (I) contesting and resisting any Legal Proceeding, and to seek
to cause to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Governmental
Order that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
Transactions under any applicable Law; (II) the obligations of the Company
under this Section 4.6 shall not require the Company or any Company Subsidiary
to incur any financial obligations prior to the Effective Time, except for the
fees and expenses of counsel or as provided in last sentence of Section 4.6(a)
and (III) the obligation by Parent, Merger Sub, and any of their Subsidiaries
to offer and consent to, and thereafter to implement, any of the following
measures if doing so would enable the parties to avoid, resolve, or lift a
Governmental Order or Legal Proceeding or to obtain any Governmental Approval:
(i) make any payment to any Governmental Authority as required by applicable
Law or the terms of any governmental grant, authorization or permit, (ii)
sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of
any assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (iii)
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, business or
portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iv) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action that it is aware or reasonably
should be aware would have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the
receipt of any Governmental Approvals.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing will be governed
exclusively by Section 4.15 and not this Section 4.6.

Section 4.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company (the "Press Release").
Except as permitted in accordance with Section 4.5, Parent and the Company
shall thereafter consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent
practicable, give each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press 

release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and consider in
good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement with respect to any matters which
are not addressed in the Press Release prior to such consultation without the
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of
any securities exchange or trading market on which securities of Parent or the
Company are listed, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or
parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release
or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party);
provided, that (i) without further consultation of the other party, either
party can confirm any matter addressed in the Press Release; and (ii) the
Company shall be permitted to disclose or make a statement contemplated by
Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company may, without Parent or Merger
Sub's consent, communicate to its employees, customers, lenders and suppliers
in a manner consistent with prior communications of the Company or consistent
with a communications plan previously agreed to by Parent and the Company.

Section 4.8 Director and Officer Liability.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each
former and present director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (each, together with such person's heirs, executors or
administrators, a "Company Indemnified Party"), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any Legal Proceeding or investigation with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the Transactions), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another Person, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) as in effect on the Agreement Date or in any agreement to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation and shall survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause Surviving
Corporation to comply with all such terms.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall: (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including
attorney's fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in 

connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and provide advancement of
expenses to, each Company Indemnified Party to the same extent such Company
Indemnified Party is indemnified or has the right to advancement of expenses
as of the Agreement Date by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Company Charter Documents, other charter and organizational
documents of the Company's Subsidiaries and the indemnification agreements in
existence on the Agreement Date with any Company Service Provider; and (ii)
include and cause to be maintained in effect in the charter and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
successors for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, regarding
elimination of liability of the Company Indemnified Parties, indemnification,
exculpation, contribution and advancement of expenses, provisions that are no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions in existence on the Agreement Date contained in the Company Charter
Documents; provided, however, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
actual or threatened Legal Proceeding made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such Legal Proceeding or resolution of such Legal
Proceeding.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporations or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such
case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation to assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 4.8 as
a condition to consummating any such consolidation, merger or transfer or
properties or assets.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premiums for a non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers'
liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of up to six (6) years on terms and conditions
no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, or any other person entitled
to the benefit of this Section 4.8, as applicable, than the existing
directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the
Company, with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior
to the Effective Time from the Company's current DandO Insurance carriers or one
or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current DandO Insurance carriers. Merger Sub and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy in full force
and effect for six (6) years after the Closing; provided, however that (y) in
no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required or
permitted to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate
amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the Agreement Date in respect of such coverage, and (z) if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount and the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain a policy in accordance with
this sentence, such policy shall provide the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to assume, honor and fulfill all obligations
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to any written
indemnification agreements with the indemnified parties, or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this Section 4.8, as applicable.

(f) The provisions of this Section 4.8 shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured person hereunder (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives (who
shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be deemed third-party beneficiaries of this
Agreement for purposes of this Section 4.8) and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

Section 4.9 Director Resignations. The Company shall provide Parent with a
correct and complete list of the directors and officers of the Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing. The Company shall, at the direction of Parent, obtain and deliver to
Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company designated by Parent to the Company
in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing.

Section 4.10 Notification of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other:

(a) Upon the Company having Knowledge that, or Parent having Knowledge, as
applicable, that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement
has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect that would cause the
condition set forth in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.3(a), as applicable, not to
be satisfied, or of any failure of such Person to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement that would cause the condition set
forth in Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.3(b), as applicable, not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of such party set forth herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the other party to consummate the Merger, or
the remedies available to the parties hereto, and provided further, that
failure to give any such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant
for the purposes of Section 6.1(c)(ii) or Section 6.1(d) of this Agreement, as
applicable;

(b) to the extent the Company has Knowledge of such notice or communication or
Parent has Knowledge of such notice or communication, as the case may be, of
any written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger;

(c) of any material written communication from any Governmental Authority
related to the Merger; and 

(d) of any proceedings commenced and served upon it or any Company
Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing

Agreement Date, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
any Section of this Agreement.

Section 4.11 Transaction Litigation. During the Interim Period, (a) the
Company and Parent shall give each other the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement and/or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and (b)

arbitration, proceeding or claim involving or against the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries set forth in Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, or (C) any litigation, investigation, arbitration, proceeding or
other claim involving or against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries brought by a Governmental Authority or otherwise involving
regulatory action or involving criminal charges or allegations or consent or
commit to the taking of any of the foregoing actions, unless in each case
Parent shall have consented in advance and in writing (which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

Section 4.12 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by
Article I, and any other dispositions of equity securities (including
derivative securities) of the Company by each individual who is or will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

Section 4.13 Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Sponsor
and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement, dated as
of February 5, 2015 (as amended as of May 1, 2018, the "Confidentiality

effect in accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate at the Effective Time
without further action by any party thereto.

Section 4.14 Approval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub; Obligations of Merger
Sub. Immediately following execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute
and deliver, in accordance with applicable Law and its organizational
documents, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written
consent adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement. Parent shall
take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly
and severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and
discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 4.15 Financing.

(a) Each of Merger Sub and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the proceeds of the 

Equity Financing on the terms and conditions described herein and in the
Equity Commitment Letter on a timely basis to facilitate the Closing and pay
all Required Amounts when required by Section 1.2. Each of Merger Sub and
Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Papers (as
replaced, amended, supplemented, modified, waived or superseded to the extent
not prohibited by Section 4.15(b) below) on a timely basis (after giving

or other appropriate proceedings, each of the foregoing pursued in good faith)
its rights under the Debt Commitment Papers, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
(including flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Papers (or on
terms not materially less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and

(other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the
Equity Financing) have been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied),
each of Merger Sub and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts (including through litigation pursued in good faith) to cause the
Financing Sources party to the Debt Financing Papers to, and shall cause the
Financing Sources party to the Equity Commitment Letter to, comply with their
respective obligations, including to fund the Financing at the Closing (and in
any event prior to the Outside Date). Each of Merger Sub and Parent shall
comply with their respective obligations, and enforce their respective rights,
under the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms therein, in
each case in a timely and diligent manner. Each of Merger Sub and Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to comply with their respective obligations, and
use reasonable best efforts to enforce their respective rights, under the Debt
Commitment Papers, in each case in a timely and diligent manner.

(b) Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision or
remedy under the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in the
Company's sole discretion), to the extent such amendments, modifications or
waivers could or could reasonably be expected to (i) reduce (or have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of aggregate cash proceeds available
from the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount) unless (but only to the extent that) Parent and
Merger Sub do not require the full amount of the Financing to fund the
Required Amount at the Closing or Parent delivers the Company an amended
Equity Commitment Letter, duly executed by the affiliates of the Sponsor
listed therein, to increase the Equity Financing by an amount equal to such
reduction to such Financing; provided, however, that no Financing Commitment
shall be reduced unless and until such financing is actually funded at the
Closing or the Company receives such amended Equity Commitment Letter, or (ii)
impose new or additional conditions precedent to the Financing or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to the Financing in a
manner that could reasonably be expected to be adverse to Merger Sub, Parent
or the Company, including any expansion, amendment or modification that would
or 

could be reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability
of Merger Sub and Parent to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions
to be consummated on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement, (B)
adversely impact the ability of Merger Sub or Parent to enforce its rights or
remedies against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or Financing
Agreements or (C) make the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date or
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing on the
Closing Date any less likely to occur; provided that, subject to compliance
with the other provisions of this Section 4.15, Parent and Merger Sub may
amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add arrangers, bookrunners, agents or
similar entities if such modifications, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay or impair the ability of
Merger Sub and Parent to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions to
be consummated on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, to modify pricing or implement or exercise any of the
flex provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Papers. Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or waiver of
any of the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements. Neither Merger
Sub nor Parent shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations
of the lenders and other Persons under the Financing Commitments or Financing
Agreements, except for (i) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letter with
alternative financing commitments pursuant to Section 4.15(c), or (ii)
assignments and replacements of lenders under the terms of the syndication of
the Financing Commitments in accordance with the terms thereof so long as any
such assignment or replacement would, were it structured as an amendment to
the existing Financing Commitment, not result in any of the circumstances
described in the first sentence of this Section 4.15(b).

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing (A) becomes or (B) would
reasonably be expected to become unavailable in the manner contemplated in the
Financing Commitments (including the flex provisions) (other than as a result
of the termination of the Financing Commitments on the Outside Date pursuant
to the terms thereof), Parent shall promptly so notify the Company. As soon as
reasonably practicable, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in the immediately preceding sentence or in Section 4.15(d)(ii); provided,
however, subject to the rules of discovery otherwise applicable, that Parent
or Merger Sub need not provide any information that it believes after
consultation with external legal counsel to be privileged. Upon the occurrence
of any circumstance referred to the second preceding sentence or in Section
4.15(d)(ii), Merger Sub and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from
the same or alternative financial institutions or other Persons (which such
alternative financing (x) shall be in an amount, when combined with Merger
Sub's and Parent's other source of funds, equal to the Required Amount on
terms (unless otherwise agreed by Parent) and conditions that are not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Merger Sub and Parent than
those in the Financing Commitments (including flex provisions) as in effect on
the Agreement Date and (y) shall not contain any terms that would not be
permitted to be effected by an amendment, modification or waiver of the
Financing Commitments pursuant to Section 4.15(b)). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the "reasonable best
efforts" of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or be construed to require Parent
or Merger Sub to, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to, seek
equity financing from any source other than those counterparty to, 

or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment
Letter. The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence
of this Section 4.15(c) or Section 4.15(a)(iii) are referred to in this
Agreement, collectively, as the "Financing Agreements." In the event any new
Financing Commitment is obtained as permitted or required in accordance
herewith, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing," the "Equity
Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment(s) as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced
pursuant to this Section 4.15 and the "Debt Commitment Papers" means the Debt
Commitment Papers as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced pursuant to
this Section 4.15, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing
Agreements" or the "Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to include the
Financing Commitment(s) that are not superseded in accordance herewith by a
new Financing Commitment at the time in question and the new Financing
Commitment(s) to the extent then in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing (or any alternative
Financing), the performance by any party to any Financing Commitment of its
obligations thereunder nor the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing (or any alternative Financing) is a condition to
Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative Financing, or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.3.

(d) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement entered
into in accordance (in each case of the foregoing, in the case of any fee
letters, to the extent required by the terms of the applicable Debt Commitment
Letter, redacted in a manner consistent with the Redacted Fee Letters)
promptly upon their execution, but in any event on the same day as the
execution thereof, (ii) without limiting the generality of the immediately
following subclause (iii), give the Company prompt written notice, of (A) any
breach of which either Merger Sub or Parent is or becomes aware by any party
of any of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitment, the
Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement entered into in
accordance with this Section 4.15 or any termination thereof or attempted or
threatened termination thereof (in each case, whether or not such attempted or
threatened termination is valid), (B) if Parent or Merger Sub obtains
Knowledge that any of the Financing Commitments ceases to be in full force and
effect and the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent or
Merger Sub or of the other parties thereto, (C) if Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Representatives receives (1) any written notice or (2)
other written communication, in each case from any Financing Source with
respect to (y) any actual breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Papers or Financing Agreements of any
provisions of the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements or (z)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation
to fund the Financing in an amount equal to the Required Amount at Closing on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, provided,
however, subject to the rules of discovery otherwise applicable, that Parent
or Merger Sub need not provide any information that is privileged if Parent
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent
feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable rule or risk waiver of such privilege), and (iii) otherwise,
promptly upon request of the Company, keep the Company reasonably informed 

on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing (or any alternative financing under this
Section 4.15).

Section 4.16 Financing Cooperation and Indemnification.

(a) Subject to (x) the last two sentences of Section 4.1 and (y) Section
4.16(b) and Section 4.16(c), prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall,

notwithstanding anything in this definition to the contrary, the Company shall
not be required to 

deliver any financial information with respect to a fiscal period that has not
yet ended or for which the applicable quarterly or annual report has not been
required to have been filed with the SEC, and which, in the case of all such
Required Information, is Compliant, and upon request of Parent, Company shall
periodically supplement the Required Information (to the extent it is
available) so that Parent and Merger Sub may ensure that such Required
Information, when taken as a whole, does not contain any material misstatement
of fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make such information not
materially misleading; provided that the filing by the Company of the required
financial statements specified in subclause (A) above in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K or its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, within such
time periods will be deemed to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all purposes of this Agreement
and (y) without limiting the generality of Section 4.1, information obtained
by Parent and the Financing Sources pursuant to this Section 4.16 will
constitute "Confidential Information" under the Confidentiality Agreement and
will be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Financing Sources and their respective representatives and advisors shall be
considered "Representatives" thereunder and shall agree to be bound thereby by
joinder thereto or otherwise;

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's and each of the

(including this Section 4.16): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including this
Section 4.16) shall require any such reasonable best efforts to the extent
that it would (a) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or

of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse
any expenses in connection with the Financing that are not contingent upon the
Effective Time or incur any actual or potential liability or obligation or

Confidentiality Agreement and will be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall be

respect to such information and the Sponsor shall be responsible for any
breach of the Confidentiality Agreement by such potential equity financing
source or any of its respective Representatives who receive such information.

purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of the Company, Merger Sub
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as

Continuing Employee with (i) at least the same level of base wages or base
salary, as applicable, that were provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus opportunities
(excluding any equity compensation) that, in the aggregate, are at least the

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, grant all Continuing
Employees credit for any service to the Company and its Subsidiaries earned
prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of

determinations, under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement in which a Continuing Employee participates that may be
established or maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries on or after the

it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of time. In
addition, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause (i) to be
waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or
satisfied by a Continuing Employee under any Company benefit plan as of the

Company Disclosure Schedules, (ii) the Stock Plans, and each agreement

agreements or other arrangements set forth on Section 4.19(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, and shall have such other effects as specified in
Section 4.19(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

(d) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (x) is intended to confer
upon any Continuing Employee any right to continued employment for any period
or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an
amendment to or any other modification of any benefit plan, (y) shall alter or
limit Parent's or the Company's or their Subsidiaries' ability to amend,
modify or terminate any particular benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or (z) is intended to confer upon any individual (including

material for purposes of clause (i) of this Section 5.3(a) and a failure of
the condition set forth in Section 5.3(a)(i).

(b) The Company shall have performed or complied with, in all material
respects, all of the obligations, agreements and covenants under this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Effective
Time;

(c) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, there shall not have occurred any
change, event, circumstance, development or effect that has had, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and

(d) The Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate, dated as of the
Closing Date, signed by an executive officer of the Company and certifying as
to the satisfaction of the conditions specified in Section 5.3(a) through
Section 5.3(c).

Section 5.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Merger Sub
or Parent may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article V
to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by such party's breach of
any provision of this Agreement which would result in the failure of the
closing condition set forth in Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.3(b), as
applicable.

ARTICLE VI 
TERMINATION

Section 6.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time whether before or after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (other than in the case of Section
6.1(a)) by written notice of the terminating party to the other parties:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

(i) the Closing shall have not been consummated on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New
York Time), on December 20, 2018 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that
a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 6.1(b) if the failure of the Closing to occur prior to the Outside
Date is primarily attributable to a failure of such party to perform any of
its covenants or obligations under this Agreement which would result in the
failure of the closing condition set forth in Section 5.2(b) or Section
5.3(b), as applicable; or 

(ii) at any time prior to the Effective Time if any Law or final, non-
appealable Governmental Order shall be in effect having the effect of making
illegal, restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the acceptance for payment of,
and payment for, the Shares pursuant to the consummation of the Merger; or

(iii) the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof); or

(c) by Parent if:

(i) at any time prior to the Closing a Triggering Event shall have occurred;
or

(ii) there shall have been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company or the Company
has failed to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform or
comply (1) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) and (2) is incapable of being cured prior to the
Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company on or before the
earlier of (A) the Outside Date or (B) the date that is thirty (30) calendar
days following the receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent of
such breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply; provided that Parent
or Merger Sub is not then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement such that it would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b); or

(d) by Company if:

(i) there shall have been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or
Parent or Merger Sub has failed to perform or comply with any of its
respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply (1) would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b) and (2) is
incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or, if curable, is not
cured by Parent or Merger Sub on or before the earlier of (A) the Outside Date
or (B) the date that is thirty (30) calendar days following the receipt by
Parent of written notice from the Company of such breach, inaccuracy or
failure to perform or comply; provided that the Company is not then in breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b); or

(ii) (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.3 have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing or unless the failure to be so satisfied is due to
any material breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or the failure of Parent
or Merger Sub to perform or comply with any of its respective material
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived, (B) Parent shall have failed to consummate the
Merger 

by the time the Closing was required to occur under Section 1.2; (C) the
Company has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that, if Parent performs
its obligations hereunder and the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter is funded, the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger; (D) the Company shall have given Parent written notice at least three
(3) Business Days prior to such termination stating the Company's intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(ii) and (E) the
Merger shall not have been consummated by the end of such three (3) Business
Day period; or

(iii) at any time prior to receiving the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board authorizes the Company to enter into a definitive Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and to,
substantially concurrently with such termination, enter into such Company
Acquisition Agreement; provided, that, (A) as a condition precedent to the
effectiveness of any such termination the Company shall have paid the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified in
Section 6.3(b) and (B) the Company concurrently shall have entered into such
Company Acquisition Agreement.

Section 6.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 6.1, this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect; provided, however, that (i) Section 4.5(f), Section 4.16(d),
this Section 6.2, Section 6.3 and Article VII (and the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Limited Guarantee) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, and (ii) nothing herein
will relieve (x) the Company from any liability for Damages resulting from
Fraud prior to the valid termination of this Agreement or (y) the Company from
any liability for Damages resulting from the Company's willful breach of this
Agreement as a result of an intentional and willful breach or an intentional
and willful material failure by the Company to perform its obligations under
this Agreement, in each case that is the consequence of an act or omission by
the Company with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure
to take such act would cause a breach of this Agreement (a "Willful Breach")
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement.

Section 6.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne by the
party incurring such cost or expense.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 6.1(c)(i) or by the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii), then the
Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. The Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) shall be paid no later
than the second (2nd) Business Day following termination pursuant to Section
6.1(c)(i) and concurrently (or the next Business Day if payment is not
feasible on the date of termination) with any termination pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(iii).

(c) If (i) after the Agreement Date but prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall have received an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Acquisition Transaction that becomes
publicly known and is not withdrawn prior to the 

termination of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated
(A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(i) or Section
6.1(b)(iii) (unless the Company would have been entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(i) or Section 6.1(d)(ii) but for such
termination pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(i) or Section 6.1(b)(iii)) or (B) by
Parent pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii) (unless the Company Termination Fee
provided in Section 6.3(b) has already been paid pursuant to the terms
thereof), and (iii) within nine (9) months after such termination, the Company
(x) enters into a definitive written agreement for any Acquisition Transaction
which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be with the party to such
Acquisition Proposal referenced in Section 6.3(c)(i) or (y) consummates an
Acquisition Transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the earlier of the date
such definitive written agreement is signed or the consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction; provided that solely for purposes of this Section
6.3(c), all references to 15% in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction"
shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.1(d)(i) or Section 6.1(d)(ii), then Parent shall pay to the Company
the Parent Termination Fee. The Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to
this Section 6.3(d) shall be paid no later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following termination pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(i) or Section 6.1(d)(ii) (it
being understood that in no event shall the Parent Termination Fee be payable
on more than one occasion).

(e) All payments under this Section 6.3 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party
to whom payment is owed.

(f) Subject to Section 6.2, Section 7.6 and notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, in the
event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Company
Termination Fee would be payable by the Company, its receipt of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.3(b) or Section 6.3(c), shall, except in
the case of Fraud or Willful Breach, (x) be deemed to be liquidated damages
for any and all Damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, each of
their Affiliates and Representatives and any other Person in connection with
this Agreement (and such termination hereof), the Transactions (and such
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter arising out of or relating
to such termination; and (y) none of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective
Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person shall be entitled to bring
or maintain any Legal Proceeding against the Company or its Affiliates arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions (or such
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters arising out of or relating
to such termination of this Agreement if the Company Termination Fee is paid
or a claim for any such Damages in such case. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 6.2 and Section 7.6 and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that the rights of Parent and
Merger Sub, if any, to (x) prior to any termination of this Agreement, obtain
injunctive relief pursuant to Section 7.6 or seek Damages in respect of any
breach of this Agreement, (y) following the termination of this Agreement,
seek Damages as set forth in Section 6.2, and (z) following the termination of
this Agreement, receive the Company 

Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.3(b) or Section 6.3(c) constitute the
sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise) of Parent, Merger Sub and each of their Affiliates and
Representatives for any and all Damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger
Sub, each of their Affiliates and Representatives and any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and such termination hereof), the Transactions
(and such abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion or, in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is paid,
have any aggregate liability under this Agreement in excess of the amount of
the Company Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or
Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and the Company Termination Fee.

(g) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this Section 6.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee due pursuant to Section 6.3, and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company commences litigation
that results in an award against the other party for such fee, the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, shall pay to the other party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such litigation, together with interest on the amount of the applicable
fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees and acknowledges that, except as expressly permitted by Section
7.6, if Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Merger or otherwise are in
breach of this Agreement, then (i) the Company's sole and exclusive remedy
against Parent, Merger Sub, any debt or equity financing source, any
Guarantor, or any of their respective Affiliates and any of their respective
former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, assignees or Representatives (collectively, the "Parent
Related Parties"), whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
6.1(d)(i) or Section 6.1(d)(ii) and to collect, if due, the Parent Termination
Fee and any other amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.16, and Section 6.3(g)
or under the Limited Guarantee, (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
shall be deemed liquidated damages for any and all direct or indirect Damages
of any kind, character or description incurred or suffered by the Company or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or the Transactions, and (iii) no other Parent Related Party shall
have any further liability or obligation whatsoever relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any of the
Transactions; provided, that the foregoing limitation of liability shall not
apply to any claims or Legal Proceedings by the Company against (A) the
Sponsor with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, (B) Parent with respect
to the expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations pursuant to
Section 4.16, (C) the Guarantors pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Limited Guarantee and (D) the parties to 

the Equity Commitment Letter for specific performance of their respective
obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, subject to the terms and
limitations thereof, and Section 7.6(a) (collectively, the "Additional
Amounts")). For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the
Company be (x) entitled to collect the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion (or, after the receipt thereof, any portion thereof or any further
funds or amounts) or (y) permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance as contemplated by Section 7.6 and any money damages,
including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. The Company
further agrees that in the event of termination the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent, Merger Sub and all of the other Parent Related Parties,
taken as a whole, shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee and the Additional Amounts and in no event shall the
Company seek to recover, or be entitled to recover, any Damages of any kind,
character or description in excess of such amount, except that such limitation
of liability shall in no event or circumstance apply to any Additional Amounts
that may be due or payable by any Parent Related Party pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement (including for such purposes the Limited Guarantee or the
Confidentiality Agreement). In no event shall the Company seek to recover, or
be entitled to recover, monetary damages from any Parent Related Party, other
than Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement or the Guarantors under the
Limited Guarantee. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, institute any proceeding or
bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement,
the Financing Commitments, the Limited Guarantee or the negotiation,
execution, performance, abandonment or termination of the Transactions
(whether at law or in equity, under any theory of liability (including without
limitation by attempting to pierce a corporate, limited liability company or
partnership veil)) against Parent or any Parent Related Party except for
claims: (i) against Parent and/or Merger Sub in accordance with and pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement; (ii) against Parent and/or Merger Sub for
indemnification or expense reimbursement under Section 4.16, (iii) against the
Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee, subject to the terms and limitations
thereof; (iv) against the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter for specific
performance of their respective obligations under the Equity Commitment
Letter, subject to the terms and limitations thereof if, and the terms set
forth in Section 7.6(a) (in case of the foregoing, other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied
(or waived); and (v) against Siris Capital Group, LLC under the
Confidentiality Agreement, subject to the terms and limitations thereof (the
claims described in clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the "Retained
Claims"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on
behalf of itself and each of its current and future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, assignees and Representatives) hereby
waives any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source or any of its
Affiliates and any of their respective former, current and future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees or
Representatives (collectively, including the Financing Sources, the "Debt
Financing Source Related Parties") in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself and each
of its current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, assignees and Representatives) agrees not to commence (and
if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any dispute, suit,
claim, litigation, investigation, proceeding or other action against any Debt
Financing Source 

Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
Debt Commitment Letters. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source Related Party shall have
any liability for any claims, losses, settlements, damages, costs, expenses,
fines or penalties to the Company (or any of its current and future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees and
Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.3(h) shall in any way
limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub (nor,
following the Closing Date, the Company as the Surviving Corporation) under
the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements.

ARTICLE VII 
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

Section 7.1 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, by
written agreement signed by all of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Financing Sources Provisions
(and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification,
waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any
Financing Sources Provisions) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

Section 7.2 Extension of Time, Waiver, etc. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of any other party hereto; provided,
however, that after adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company
Common Stock (if applicable), no waiver shall be made which would pursuant to
applicable Law require further approval by such holders without obtaining such
further approval; (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in the
Agreement, waive any of such party's conditions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Merger Sub or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or further
exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

Section 7.3 No Additional Representations; No Survival. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, their
respective Affiliates or their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders,
controlling Persons or Representatives shall have any liability or
responsibility whatsoever to any other party hereto, its Affiliates or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling Persons or
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or
made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to such
party, its 

Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling
Persons or Representatives, including in respect of the specific
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article II of this
Agreement and in respect of the specific representations and warranties of
Merger Sub and Parent set forth in Article III of this Agreement, except as
and only to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to
such representations and warranties, subject to the limitations and
restrictions contained in this Agreement. None of the representations and
warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Date or the termination of this
Agreement. This Section 7.3 shall not limit the survival of any covenant or
agreement of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Date or the termination of this
Agreement.

Section 7.4 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary.

(a) This Agreement, including the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Company
Disclosure Schedules, the Parent Disclosure Schedules, the Limited Guarantee,
the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the documents and
instruments relating to the Merger referred to in this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This
Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of
employment with any person, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except (i)
the directors and officers of the Company (with respect to matters covered by
Section 4.8 and this Section 7.4), (ii) the Financing Sources (with respect to
the Financing Sources Provisions), and (iii) the Parent Related Parties (with
respect to Section 6.3(h)).

(b) The inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Schedules will not
be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that a violation,
right of termination, default, liability or other obligation of any kind
exists with respect to any item, nor will it be construed as or constitute an
admission or agreement that such information is material to the Company. In
addition, matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedules are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in
the Company Disclosure Schedules (including the listing of items on any
Company Disclosure Schedules although such items may not necessarily be
required to be included in such Company Disclosure Schedules because of the
dollar thresholds set forth in this Agreement). Such additional matters are
set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount
in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor
the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedules is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so
included or other items, are or are not material, and no Person will use the
fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Company
Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedules is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or other 

items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, and no Person will use the fact of setting forth or the
inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Company Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice for purposes of this
Agreement.

in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement or the
Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. Subject,
in each case, to the terms of this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly
conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not
exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in
equity. Subject, in each case, to the terms of this Agreement, the exercise by
a party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by
it of any other remedy.

(b) SUBJECT TO Section 7.12, ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED SOLELY AND
EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF
PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET
FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD
OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER 

PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH
PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS Section 7.5(c).

Section 7.6 Specific Enforcement.

(a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 7.6, the parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached,
and, at the non-breaching party's election, such non-breaching party shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
chosen in Section 7.5(b). Each party hereby waives any requirement for the
posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection with the obtaining of
any injunctive relief or specific performance. This right to injunctive relief
and specific performance is in addition to any other remedy to which the
parties to this Agreement are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is acknowledged and agreed that
Parent has an obligation hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be funded,
including by exercising its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and the
parties hereto further agree that the right of the Company to obtain an
injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing Parent and Merger Sub to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) shall be subject to the requirements that:

(i) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the
Closing, all the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.3 would
have been satisfied (or have been waived by Parent) if the Closing were to
have occurred at such time (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable
of being satisfied at the time that the Closing would have occurred but for
the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded);

(ii) the Debt Financing (or, in the case alternative debt financing has been
obtained in accordance with Section 4.15(c) for all the Debt Financing, such
alternative debt financing) has been funded or would be funded in accordance
with the terms thereof at the Closing, if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing;

(iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance with
Section 1.2, and

(i) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that (A) all
conditions in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 have been satisfied or that it is
willing to waive any such open conditions, and (B) if specific performance is
granted and if the Equity Financing and
