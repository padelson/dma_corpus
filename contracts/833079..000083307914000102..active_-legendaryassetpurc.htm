extent Balance Sheet Operating Liabilities related to such items are reflected
on the Final Closing Balance Sheet;

2. Disclosure of Liabilities on a disclosure schedule attached hereto (other than APA Schedule 1.4.A(1)) shall in no way affect Selling Parties' responsibilities hereunder relating to Excluded Liabilities.

1.5 Purchase Price; Earn-Out; and Adjustment.

A. Purchase Price. As purchase price for the Acquired Assets, Seller will be
paid at Closing the following consideration (the "Purchase Price"), which
shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, and which Buyer will pay to Seller, in
immediately available funds, the sum of the items (1) (as shown on the
Preliminary Balance Sheet) and (2) below reduced by the sum of the items in
(3) and (4) (each as shown on the Preliminary Balance Sheet), and further
reduced by the sum of the items in (5) and (6) below (such payment, the
"Closing Payment"), as the amount thereof may be later adjusted based on the
Final Closing Balance Sheet per the procedures in Section 1.5C below:

1. the book value of the Acquired Assets minus the amount of Seller's Cash and Cash Equivalents, in each case, determined in accordance with GAAP, as to be estimated on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and conclusively shown on the Final Closing Balance Sheet

2. a Premium of $45,000,000 (the "Premium")

3. all Indebtedness of Seller, whether to a third party, Selling Party or affiliate or associate thereof, encompassing the line items "Construction Loans", "Short Term Notes Payable-Member" and "Note Payable-Member" as to be estimated on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and conclusively shown on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, to be paid off by Buyer at Closing and treated as Purchase Price consideration; provided, however, (i) Buyer shall have no obligation to pay off any indebtedness of Seller to the extent it exceeds the sum of the aggregate amounts determined under clause (1) - (2) above and (ii) any prepayment penalty or similar charge shall be paid by Seller from its existing cash balances (or otherwise serve as a reduction to the Purchase Price)



4. the sum of the Balance Sheet Operating Liabilities and Assumed Employee Liabilities, as to be estimated on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and conclusively shown on the Final Closing Balance Sheet

5. $500,000 representing the Holdback Fund (described in subsection D below)

6. $1,000,000 representing the Warranty Fund (described in Section 3.5)

In addition, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Earn-out payments, if any, as
contemplated in Section 1.5B. The Purchase Price shall include any amounts
from the Holdback Fund and Warranty Fund only to the extent eventually paid to
Seller.

B. Earn-Out. In addition to the foregoing, Seller will receive from Buyer
deferred payments, to the extent earned, in an amount equal to the sum of (i)
10.8% of the Pre-Tax Net Income of the Business plus (ii) an additional 9.2%
of the Pre-Tax Net Income of the Business in excess of $30,816,000, determined
in accordance with GAAP subject to the mutually agreed pro forma adjustments
described below, for each Earn-Out Period as provided below and such payments
will be a component of the Purchase Price (collectively, the "Earn-Out
Payments"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if at any time during any
12-month Earn-Out Period Steven K. Taylor ceases to be employed by Buyer by
virtue of his resignation without "Good Reason" (as such term is defined in
his Employment Agreement with Buyer) or by a termination by Buyer with Cause
(as defined in Appendix I), fifty percent (50%) of the Earn-Out Payment for
that Earn-Out Period and fifty percent (50%) of any Earn-Out Payment for all
remaining Earn-Out Periods will be forfeited, (ii) if at any time during any
12-month Earn-Out Period Patrick B. Madden ceases to be employed by Buyer by
virtue of his resignation without "Good Reason" (as such term is defined in
his Employment Agreement with Buyer) or by a termination by Buyer with Cause
(as defined in Appendix I), twenty percent (20%) of the Earn-Out Payment for
that Earn-Out Period and twenty percent (20%) of any Earn-Out Payment for all
remaining Earn-Out Periods will be forfeited, and (iii) if at any time during
the 12-month Earn-Out period Richard B. Means ceases to be employed by Buyer
by virtue of his resignation without "Good Reason" (as defined in the Means
Agreement) or by a termination by Buyer with Cause (as defined in Appendix I),
thirty percent (30%) of the Earn-Out Payment for that Earn-Out Period and
thirty percent (30%) of any Earn-Out Payment for all remaining Earn-Out
Periods will be forfeited.

1. "Earn-Out Period" will mean for the first Earn-Out Period, the period commencing on August 1, 2014 and ending on July 31, 2015; for the second Earn-Out Period, the period commencing on August 1, 2015 and ending on July 31, 2016; for the final Earn-Out Period, the period commencing on August 1, 2016 and ending on July 31, 2017.

2. "Pre-Tax Net Income" will mean the consolidated income of the Business before income Taxes determined in accordance with GAAP, after giving 



effect to the following (to the extent not already reflected in the
calculation of such income of the Business, and in each case as may be further
clarified per subsection 3 below):

(i) Seller's Charlotte, North Carolina-area assets will be managed and built-
out and/or sold by Meritage's existing Charlotte operations, provided, however
that the Earn-Out calculation will include the Pre-Tax Income from the
Charlotte-area Acquired Assets (which shall include the "BK Charlotte
Pipeline" (as defined in Appendix I), but will not include any portion of the
Pre-Tax Net Income relating to Buyer's existing Charlotte-area business or any
additional investments in or related to the Charlotte area business after the
Closing (other than any BK Charlotte Pipeline eventually purchased by Buyer
during any Earn-Out Period). For the Greenville, South Carolina and Atlanta,
Georgia markets, the Earn-Out calculations will include Pre-Tax Net Income
from pipeline and future investments in or related to these two markets (but
will exclude the business, revenue and income relating to any future business
acquisitions of other residential builders in those markets). The Pre-Tax Net
Income with respect to Seller's Charlotte area assets shall be calculated
after deduction of an overhead charge to be calculated to allocate the
proportional share (based on revenue) of the costs associated with the
Charlotte area Acquired Assets and Buyer's existing and future business in the
Charlotte area market.

(ii) inclusion as expenses of compensation paid to each of Steven K. Taylor,
Patrick B. Madden and Richard B. Means under their respective employment
agreements;

(iii) inclusion as expenses of corporate costs or expenses allocable to Buyer
in accordance with standard policies and methods of Meritage Homes Corporation
as well as all business transactions between the Business and Buyer or its
affiliates, including without limitation, purchases of products or services
from Buyer's affiliates, which items shall be reflected at cost and on a basis
consistent with how Buyer allocates costs and expenses to other divisions;

(iv) inclusion as expenses of a "Corporate Interest Charge," which shall
consist of interest costs allocated to Buyer by Meritage Homes Corporation,
whether expensed directly or amortized through cost of sales, in accordance
with Meritage Homes Corporation's standard allocation policies and methods;

(v) The Premium and any purchase price accounting adjustments impacting Pre-
Tax Net Income shall be (x) excluded, for purposes of computing the Corporate
Interest Charge, from the "aggregate book value of the assets of the
Business;" and (y) neither deducted nor amortized in computing the Pre-Tax Net
Income for any period;



(vi) all transaction costs of Buyer and its affiliates with respect to or
arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements (including the fees and expenses of accountants, legal
counsel and financial advisors of Buyer and its affiliates) shall be (x)
excluded, for purposes of computing the Corporate Interest Charge, from the
"aggregate book value of the assets of the Business" and (y) neither deducted
nor amortized in computing the Pre-Tax Net Income for any period;

(vii) payments under any indemnification provision or to replenish the
Holdback Fund or the Warranty Fund shall not be included in the income of
Buyer for purposes of computing Pre-Tax Net Income;

(viii) charges against net income resulting from significant post-Closing
changes in accounting principles that are not required by GAAP will be
excluded in computing Pre-Tax Net Income;

(ix) Pre-Tax Net Income will be computed before consideration of the Earn-Out
Payments; and

(x) if during the Earn-out Period the Business shall sell, transfer, or
otherwise dispose of to a third party any material portion of the Business,
the income from which is taken into account in defining Pre-Tax Net Income and
that sale, disposition or transfer could adversely affect any Earn-out
Compensation, then the amount of Pre-Tax Net Income shall be appropriately and
equitably adjusted in light of past contributions to Pre-Tax Net Income made
by such business transferred.

3. Exhibit B hereto sets forth a sample calculation of the Earn-Out (the "Sample Earn-Out Calculation"). In the event of a conflict between the description of the calculation set forth herein and Exhibit B, Exhibit B shall control. Buyer shall exercise its prerogatives as the owner and operator of the Business after the Closing in good faith, without any action or omission whose primary purpose or intent is to reduce the Pre-Tax Net Income so as to reduce the Earn-Out earned hereunder.

4. There will be three Earn-Out Payments, if earned, one for each of the three consecutive Earn-Out Periods following the Closing Date.

5. Buyer will pay to the Seller 90% of each estimated Earn-Out Payment for the previous (i.e., just ended) Earn-Out Period in cash on or before the sixtieth (60th) day following the end of that Earn-Out Period. Buyer will deliver to Seller on or prior to such payment a notice setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the estimated Pre-Tax Net Income for such Earn-Out Period.

6. Seller shall have a period of ten days to dispute in writing the calculation of the Earn-Out Payment. If Seller does not dispute the calculation of 



the Earn-Out Payment, Buyer will pay to Seller the remaining 10% of such Earn-
Out Payment within ten days of the expiration of the dispute period. If the
Seller disputes the calculation of the Earn-Out Payment and Buyer and the
Seller are unable to resolve that dispute, the parties will arbitrate the
dispute in the manner provided in Section 3 of Exhibit C, except as modified
herein. Seller may accept the partial estimated Earn-Out Payment without any
effect on its rights to so dispute the calculation. There will be a single
arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") appointed by agreement of Buyer and the Seller
within thirty (30) days of receipt by Buyer of a notice from the Seller that
the Earn-Out Payment calculation is disputed, or, if no timely agreement is
reached, selected in the manner provided in Section C of Exhibit C. Such
Arbitrator will be entitled to hire and rely on an accounting firm of at least
one hundred certified public accountants (other than the firms then serving as
auditors for Buyer or that provide accounting, Tax or other services to
Selling Parties or Seller), as may be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller
(or if no agreement, then as decided by the Arbitrator). The arbitration award
rendered by the Arbitrator will be final and binding on all parties, and
judgment on the arbitration award may be enforced in any court having
jurisdiction. If the Earn-Out Payment as determined by the Arbitrator is less
than or within 3% of the amount calculated by Buyer, Selling Parties will pay
all of the cost of the parties' accounting and other professionals and will
bear the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator. Conversely, if the Earn-Out
Payment as determined by the Arbitrator is greater than the amount calculated
by Buyer by more than 3%, Buyer will pay all of the cost of the parties'
accounting and other professionals and will bear the fees and expenses of the
Arbitrator. Upon receipt of the arbitration award, Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, will pay to the other party the amount determined and reflected
by the arbitration award.

C. Adjustment.

1. For the purpose of making an initial determination of the Purchase Price of the Business, Seller will deliver to Buyer, at least five (5) days prior to the Closing, a balance sheet, prepared in accordance with GAAP and with the adjustments reflecting Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities on a basis consistent with the Sample Balance Sheet, in each case reflecting the estimated closing balances for the Business as of Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"). If Buyer objects to the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, the parties will seek in good faith to promptly resolve the dispute.

2. No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller a balance sheet reflecting its determination of actual closing balances for the Business, prepared on a basis consistent with the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet (the "Final Closing Balance Sheet).

3. The Final Closing Balance Sheet will become final and binding on the parties, unless within fifteen (15) business days following delivery thereof to Seller, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects thereto. During such period, 



Seller and its advisers shall have access to the work papers and support
documents of the accountants preparing such Final Closing Balance Sheet. If
Seller objects to the Final Closing Balance Sheet, and after good faith
consultation with respect to the objection the parties are unable to reach an
agreement within fifteen (15) days, then the parties will resolve the dispute
in the manner provided in Exhibit C.

4. Within three (3) days of the determination of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, (i) in the event the amounts set forth on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet result in a higher Purchase Price than as set forth on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, Selling Parties will within three business days refund to Buyer an amount equal to such excess or (ii) in the event the amounts of the Business set forth on the Final Closing Balance Sheet result in a higher Purchase Price than as set forth on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer will within three business days pay to Seller as additional Purchase Price an amount equal to such excess. Any payment shall be deemed an adjustment to the Purchase Price and not for indemnification.

D. Holdback. At the Closing, Buyer will hold back $500,000 (the "Holdback
Fund"). The Holdback Fund will be used by Buyer to satisfy indemnification
claims of the Buyer that may arise hereunder. The amount of the Holdback Fund,
less any reimbursed or pending indemnification or other claims by Buyer, shall
be distributed to Seller on the day that is forty-two (42) months following
the Closing Date. In addition, if at any time during such forty-two (42) month
period, the Holdback Fund is insufficient to reimburse Buyer for any
indemnification claims of Buyer that may arise hereunder, then Buyer shall be
entitled to recover the amount of such insufficiency from the Warranty Fund.
Seller also agrees that if any time prior to the day that is forty-two (42)
months following the Closing Date, the amount of funds held in the Holdback
Fund is less than $100,000, Seller (or the Selling Parties) shall, within five
days of Buyer's written request, pay to Buyer additional funds to be deposited
into the Holdback Fund by paying to Buyer the amount necessary to replenish
the Holdback Fund to (i) if in the first two years of such period, $250,000,
or (ii) if thereafter, $125,000. As further provided in Section 6.7B, if
Seller (or the Selling Parties) fails to deposit additional funds into the
Holdback Fund as required in the above sentence or if such Holdback Fund is
otherwise depleted, Buyer may, in addition to any other rights it may have
with respect thereto, offset the amount of any shortfall/deficiency against
any future Earn-Out Payments owed to Seller.

1.6 Allocation of Purchase Price.

A. Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will provide to Seller copies of IRS Form 8594 and any
required exhibits thereto (the "Purchase Price Allocation Schedule") with
Buyer's proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (together with any Assumed
Liabilities). The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule will be accepted by
Seller so long as approximately ninety-five percent (95%) of the Premium paid
at Closing is allocated to assets the sale of which would give rise to long-
term capital gains for the Seller (the "Previously Agreed Upon Allocation").
If, at any



time prior to the Closing but after the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule is
proposed by Buyer and accepted (or deemed accepted) by Seller, there is an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, or any component thereof, which adjustment
results in a reduction of the Premium paid at Closing to an amount below
Forty-Five Million Dollars ($45,000,000), then, in Buyer's discretion, either
(i) Buyer will amend the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, such that
approximately ninety-five percent (95%)of the adjusted Premium paid at Closing
is allocated to assets the sale of which would give rise to long-term capital
gains for the Seller, which Purchase Price Allocation Schedule will be
accepted by Seller, or (ii) the parties will make such other adjustment as are
proposed by Buyer subject to the procedures below. If the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule is inconsistent with the Previously Agreed Upon
Allocation, then the Seller may object to the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule (or amended Purchase Price Allocation Schedule) within fifteen (15)
days after the receipt of such Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, by
proposing to Buyer in writing changes to such Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule (and in the event no such changes are proposed in writing to Buyer
within such time period, Seller will be deemed to have agreed to, and
accepted, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule even if such Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule is inconsistent with the Previously Agreed Upon
Allocation). If Seller objects to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as
contemplated in the immediately preceding sentence, then Buyer and Seller will
endeavor in good faith to resolve any differences with respect to the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule within fifteen (15) days after Buyer's receipt of
written notice of objection from Seller, and failing the same, the matter
shall be arbitrated in the manner set forth in Exhibit C. Except to the extent
required by law or by a "determination" within the meaning of Code Section
1313(a) (or state law equivalent thereof), Buyer and the Selling Parties shall
treat the Earn-Out paid as a component part of, or an adjustment to, the
Purchase Price for all purpose of this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and Internal Revenue Service Form
8594, except for any amount treated as interest under Code Section 483.

B. Tax Returns. Buyer and Seller each hereby agree to file their respective
Tax Returns, Tax reports, and Tax forms, including Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594, in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
(as amended as contemplated in Section 1.6A). Buyer and the Selling Parties
shall not (i) take any position in any Tax Return, Tax report, or Tax form,
including any amendments thereto, or (ii) reach any settlement or agreement in
respect of any Tax audit which, in either case, is inconsistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as amended as contemplated above), unless
mandated by Tax Law. If mandated by Tax Law, the party taking such position
shall provide timely and reasonable notice to the other party of this
determination. Nothing in this Section 1.6 shall affect the reporting of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements in any GAAP Financial
Statements. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
first two sentences of this Section 1.6B shall not apply to the extent
required by law or by a "determination" within the meaning of Code Section
1313(a) (or state law equivalent thereof). In addition, Seller covenants to
remain in existence through, at least, the final payment due and owing
respecting the Earn-Out, and shall file all Tax Returns, reports and forms
(including IRS Form 8594) consistent with the foregoing, including



treating the Earn-Out as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Federal
income tax purposes and filing an amended IRS Form 8594 in connection with any
Earn-Out payment.

1.7 Withholding Tax. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Purchase Price (including the Earn-Out Payments, if any) all Taxes that Buyer
may be required to deduct and withhold under any provision of Tax Law. All
such withheld amounts shall be treated as delivered to Seller hereunder.

1.8 Risk of Loss. All risk of loss with respect to the Acquired Assets before
the Effective Time will remain the sole risk of Seller, and all risk of loss
with respect to the Acquired Assets subsequent to the Effective Time will
become the sole risk of Buyer.

ARTICLE II 
Conduct Pending The Closing

2.1 Conduct of Business Pending the Closing. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement or set forth on Schedule 2.1, Seller will, and the Members will

1. carry on the Business in the ordinary course, in accordance with Law and in substantially the same manner as previously conducted;

2. preserve intact the Acquired Assets in all material respects;

3. maintain all facilities and equipment in good condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted;

4. use commercially reasonable efforts to keep available the services of Seller's officers and employees as a group;

5. maintain satisfactory relationships with material suppliers, customers, Governmental Authorities and others having material business relationships with Seller;

6. not take any action that would result in a breach or inaccuracy of Section 3.9 of Appendix III;

7. not increase Seller's aggregate borrowings to be paid off by Buyer at Closing pursuant to Section 1.5A(3) to more than $84,000,000, except for borrowings in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

8. not make any non-cash distributions to equityholders;

9. not increase total assets by more than 20% compared to the total assets reflected on the Sample Balance Sheet; and



10. continue to schedule and execute starts and closings consistent with past practices and generally in accordance with the starts and sales projections as set forth on Schedule 3.12(1)(E).

2.2 Notification of Certain Matters. Seller and the Seller Indemnitors will:

1. confer on a regular basis with representatives of Buyer and its affiliates and report operational matters and the general status of ongoing operations;

2. notify Buyer of any material adverse change in the normal course of its business or in the operation of its properties and of any Governmental Authority or third-party complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated);

3. not take any action which would render, or which reasonably may be expected to render, any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement untrue at, or at any time prior to, the Closing; and

4. promptly notify Buyer if Selling Parties discover that any representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement was when made, or has subsequently become, untrue.

2.3 No Negotiations. Selling Parties will not, directly or indirectly (and
will not authorize any officer, director, representative, member or Selling
Party) to solicit, initiate, encourage the submission or otherwise negotiate
with, or respond to any proposal or offer from any person or entity relating
to any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, or
sale of equities of Seller, or acquisition or purchase of all or substantially
all of the Acquired Assets, or other business combination involving Seller or
the Acquired Assets or the Business, or participate in any negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other person any information with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist, or participate in any effort
or attempt by any other person to pursue such an alternative proposal. In the
event of any inquiry from any person with respect to any alternative proposal,
Selling Parties will promptly notify Buyer and such person, without disclosing
the identity of the other, that Seller is then subject to an exclusive
negotiation agreement with an unnamed party that precludes Seller from having
any negotiations with such person or entity.

2.4 Public Announcements. Buyer and Seller will agree on the form and content
of the initial press release regarding the transactions contemplated hereby
and until the Closing the parties will not issue any press release or public
announcement, including announcements by any party for general reception by or
dissemination to employees, agents, interested persons, or customers, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior consent of the other parties hereto (which consent will not be withheld
unreasonably); provided, however, that Buyer and its affiliates may make any
disclosure or announcement that, in the opinion of its counsel, it is
obligated to make pursuant to Laws (including federal securities Laws) or
pursuant to applicable rules or regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.



2.5 Confidentiality. Until the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement dated
March 30, 2014, among the parties shall remain in full force and effect and
shall be deemed to apply and bind all Selling Parties.

2.6 Consents and Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to do all things necessary or advisable to consummate this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents of
third parties, and all approvals of Governmental Authorities and to make all
necessary registrations and filings and submissions of information to
Governmental Authorities to secure the benefits thereof for Buyer to the
Acquired Assets (including, but not limited to, all contracts contemplated by
this Agreement) through other lawful means. Selling Parties, and Buyer agree
that they, at any time before or after the Closing, will execute, acknowledge,
and deliver any further consents, deeds, assignments, assumptions,
conveyances, documents, and instruments of transfer or receipt either
necessary to consummate the sale, transfer, assignment, assumption, grant, or
conveyance of the Acquired Assets. The costs and expenses to secure any
consents or approvals, make any filings or submissions, or otherwise carry out
the intent and purpose of this provision shall be: (A) if related to the
transfer or assignment of an Acquired Non-Real Estate Contract or Existing
Real Estate Contract, including any and all costs relating to counterparty
consents, be borne by Seller, (B) if related to the transfer or other required
procedures relating to the Real Property Assets forming part of the Acquired
Assets, including transfer Taxes, title insurance premiums or expenses, or re-
issuance or transfer of construction permits, shall be allocated pursuant to
Sections 3.6 and 3.7 hereof and (C) if related to the transfer, assignment,
approval or new application by Buyer of a license or Permit issued by a
Governmental Authority, unless set forth otherwise on Schedule 2.6, be borne
by Buyer.

To the extent any prospective contract or Permit forming part of the Acquired
Assets is not capable of being assigned without the consent or waiver of the
other party thereto or any third party (including any Governmental Authority),
or if such assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a breach
thereof or a violation of any Laws, neither this Agreement nor the Transaction
Agreements shall constitute an assignment or an attempted assignment of such
transferred contract or Permit without the requisite consent or waiver. If any
such consents and waivers are not obtained by Seller with respect to any
transferred contract or Permit, the Transaction Agreements shall constitute an
equitable assignment by Seller to Buyer of all of Seller's rights, benefits,
title and interest in and to such contract or Permit, to the extent permitted
by Law, and Buyer shall be deemed to be the Seller's agent for the purpose of
completing, fulfilling and discharging all of the Seller's rights and
liabilities arising after the Closing Date under such contract or Permit.
Seller and the Seller Indemnitors shall take all reasonable steps and actions
to provide Purchaser with the benefits of such contract.

In addition to and without limiting the foregoing paragraphs of this Section
2.6, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to do all things necessary or advisable to consummate the transfer to
Buyer all of the licenses, permits and Government approvals held by the
License Holders, which licenses, permits and Government approvals the Selling
Parties acknowledge are critical to the success and operation of the Business.
Such efforts shall include



using commercially reasonable efforts through all lawful means to obtain all
necessary waivers, consents of third parties, and all approvals of
Governmental Authorities and to make all necessary registrations and filings
and submissions of information to Governmental Authorities to secure the
benefits thereof for Buyer of such licenses and permits held by the License
Holders, including where necessary or appropriate, assisting Buyer in applying
for replacement licenses and permits in Buyer's name and providing individuals
to serve as qualifying parties for such licenses and permits.

2.7 Right to Enter and Inspect. From time to time prior to the Closing, upon
reasonable notice, subject to Law, Buyer and its affiliates will have
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to enter the Owned Real
Property with Buyer's and its affiliates representatives and agents to examine
the Owned Real Property and the Acquired Assets, conduct environmental
studies, engineering feasibility studies, and other tests and studies
reasonable and customary for a transaction of the type contemplated hereby,
and otherwise to evaluate, inspect and examine the Acquired Assets and the
Business and affairs of Seller. Buyer shall indemnify and defend Selling
Parties, their officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents,
from all Liabilities which may be asserted against Selling Parties or any of
the foregoing indemnified parties as a result of, or in connection with, the
access, examination, evaluation, inspection, investigation and tests and
studies made by Buyer and its affiliates or their representatives or agents to
the extent arising out of their gross negligence or willful misconduct. Upon
request of Buyer, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Buyer similar access to Contracted Real Property.

2.8 Tax Certificates. Selling Parties agree to furnish to Buyer certificates
from state or other Taxing authorities (if otherwise reasonably available in
any such states or authorities) to evidence that all sales and use Tax
Liabilities of Seller accruing before the Closing Date have been fully
satisfied or otherwise provided for by Seller.

2.9 Contemplated Transfer and Exercise of Option-Additional Selling Party.
Seller has previously issued to Legendary Consulting, Inc. an option for such
entity to purchase fifty percent (50%) of the membership interests in Seller.
It is contemplated that Legendary Consulting, Inc. will, prior to or
concurrent with Closing: (A) transfer and assign such option to its sole
owner, Gra Kell Trust, a Georgia trust with Robert C. Belans, Timothy A.
Taylor, and Steven Taylor, as co-trustees ("GKT"); (B) GKT shall subsequently
transfer and assign such option to Eleven Strategic Investments Trust, a
Nevada trust with 11 Advisors, LLC as trustee ("ESIT"); and (C) ESIT shall
subsequently exercise such option and thereby obtain a fifty percent (50%)
ownership interest in the Seller. Upon such transaction, ESIT shall execute a
Joinder Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer whereby it
shall: (i) become a party to this Agreement as a Member and Selling Party, and
(ii) expressly become a Seller Indemnitor hereunder, and (iii) without
limiting other obligations hereunder, agree to enter into the Non-Disclosure
and Non-Compete Agreement.

ARTICLE III 
Additional Agreements

3.1 Employment. Seller shall pay at the Closing all compensation, benefits,
perquisites and other payments earned by Seller's employees and independent
contractors for



periods prior to the Effective Time together, in each instance, with related
Taxes ("Employee Liabilities") other than the following items (A), (B) and (C)
as the "Assumed Employee Liabilities": (A) current salaries or commissions and
in either instance, related Taxes accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet,
(B) unutilized vacation days together, in each instance, with related Taxes
shown on APA Schedule 3.1 and accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet as to
the employees hired by Buyer on the basis that Buyer shall honor the current
vacation procedures through at least 2014, and (C) commissions to sales agents
of Legendary Realty and Marketing, Inc. relating to homes of the Business sold
after the Closing. To the extent Buyer makes any payments of Employee
Liabilities after the Closing, Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for such
payments. Seller shall pay in cash to its employees and independent
contractors any bonuses, incentive compensation, or other compensation then
earned through Closing; provided, however, with respect to 2014 annual
employee bonuses and incentive compensation attributable to the period between
January 1, 2014 and the Closing that may become payable to Seller's employees
hired by Buyer, Seller may prior to Closing elect to have such amounts
(together with all related Taxes) treated as Assumed Employee Liabilities, in
which case all such amounts shall be accrued on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet and Buyer will be responsible for paying the respective accrued amounts
to any of such employees who may be employed Buyer at the time Buyer pays 2014
annual bonuses to its other employees

1. All employees or independent contractors of Seller shall remain employees or independent contractors of Seller through the Closing. Prior to or concurrent with the Closing, Buyer may make offers to employ such employees or full-time independent contractors as Buyer determines in its sole discretion; provided, however, that (1) Buyer hereby agrees to engage Taylor and Patrick B. Madden as employees of Buyer pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement to be entered into by and between Buyer and each such individual (the "Employment Agreements"), (2) Buyer hereby agrees to engage Means as an employee of Buyer pursuant to the terms of an agreement to be entered into by and between Buyer and Means (the "Means Agreement"), and (3) Buyer agrees to hire or offer employment to a sufficient number of Seller employees such that it would not trigger Seller to be subject to the reporting and notification requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

2. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Code or Treasury Regulations to the contrary, Seller and its subsidiaries shall be responsible for, and retain all liability relating to any group health plan continuation or conversion coverage required under Section 4980B of the Code, or applicable state or local laws (the "Required COBRA Coverage") with respect to each "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4890B-9, QandA-4. The Seller and its affiliates shall continue to maintain a group health plan or otherwise arrange similar coverage until the maximum coverage period for the MandA qualified beneficiary having the longest maximum coverage period, including extensions, has expired, in order to prevent the transfer of the obligation to provide the Required COBRA Coverage to the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.



3. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate reasonably with each other to provide an orderly administrative transition to Buyer of any Seller employees who are offered and accept employment with Buyer, including the provision by Seller to Buyer of all necessary or appropriate documents, records, materials, accounting files and Tax information with respect to each such employee as consistent with applicable law. Seller and Buyer agree to utilize the standard procedure set forth in IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting, such that Seller shall be responsible for all reporting of wages and other compensation paid by it to such employees on or before the Closing Date (including furnishing and filing of Forms W-2 and W-3). In addition, Seller shall furnish to Buyer the Forms W-4 and W-5 of each Seller employee who is offered and accepts employment with Buyer for the portion of the calendar year up to and including the Closing Date.

3.2 Charter Amendment and Cancellation of Affiliate Agreements. Subject to the
provisions of the Non-Disclosure and Non-Compete Agreement, Seller agrees to
amend its charter documents and related authorizations and filings (e.g. dba
authorization), if any, within thirty (30) days after the Closing, deleting
all references to "Legendary," "Legendary Communities" or any variations
thereof. Effective upon the Closing, the Selling Parties will terminate and
cancel all existing affiliate agreements with or involving the Business (other
than the Affiliate Option Agreements referenced in Section 3.6), including,
but not limited to, agreements relating to cross default provisions involving
the Existing Real Estate Contracts or any indemnity or subrogation agreements
among the Selling Parties, in each case, that could in any way adversely
affect the Buyer's use or title to the Acquired Assets, operation of the
Business or otherwise expose Buyer to any Losses.

3.3 Independent Auditors. To the extent required by Meritage Homes Corporation
for its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), Seller
and the Seller Indemnitors shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
(without any out-of-pocket expense to them) to authorize and cause the
independent auditors who had provided services to Seller to (i) assist
Meritage Homes Corporation in preparing consolidated financial statements in
compliance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, (ii) include
consents to their reports in such filings with the SEC, and (iii) provide any
necessary comfort letters in respect of any financings by Meritage Homes
Corporation, with the post-closing undertakings of such independent auditors
all at Buyer's cost.

3.4 Selling Parties' Representative. Selling Parties shall at all times
maintain a representative (the "Selling Parties' Representative") for purposes
of taking certain actions and giving certain consents on behalf of Selling
Parties as specified herein. Each Selling Party hereby appoints Richard B.
Means as Selling Parties' Representative; provided however, if Richard B.
Means dies, is incapacitated or unavailable to act, Steven K. Taylor is hereby
authorized to take all actions hereunder as Selling Parties' Representative.
Selling Parties may elect one or more replacements to be Selling Parties'
Representative appointed hereunder, provided that Buyer is notified in writing
thereof (including written agreement by such replacement to serve as Selling
Parties' Representative as set forth herein). Each Selling Party acknowledges
that actions taken, consents given and representations made by Selling
Parties' Representative on behalf of Selling Parties pursuant hereto shall be
binding upon Selling Parties.



This appointment and grant of power and authority by each Selling Party is
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any
act of Selling Parties or by operation of law, whether by the death or
incapacity of Selling Parties or by the occurrence of any other event. Selling
Parties' Representative is authorized by Selling Parties to take any action on
behalf of Selling Parties to facilitate or administer the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation, amending or waiving any
provision of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, settling
indemnification claims, and executing such other documents or instruments as
Selling Parties' Representative deems appropriate.

3.5 Warranty Administration. Buyer will not assume, but will for eighteen (18)
months following the Closing, administer warranty claims for the account of
Seller arising out of pre-Closing operations, to the extent of the Warranty
Fund described below. The parties agree that the amount to be held back (the
"Warranty Fund") from the Closing proceeds to cover estimated warranty claims
relating to homes closed prior to Closing shall be $1,000,000. If at any time
after Closing it appears that the Warranty Fund will be insufficient to handle
Seller's warranty claims, Buyer shall endeavor to notify Seller an estimated
thirty (30) days prior to when the fund is expected to be exhausted and,
within twenty (20) days thereof, Seller will either: (A) increase the fund to
an amount the parties estimate will satisfy future claims during the eighteen
(18) month warranty administration period (which process will be repeated as
required), or (B) take over itself the administration of such warranty claims
per its rights below. If Seller (or the Selling Parties) fail to replenish the
Warranty Fund or take over the warranty administration as required, Buyer may
(at its sole option) withdraw from the Holdback Fund, offset against the Earn-
Out and/or offset against any other amounts due Seller or any Selling Party in
order to effectively replenish the Warranty Fund. In no event shall Buyer be
obligated to administer warranty claims unless moneys to pay for them are set
aside in the Warranty Fund. Buyer will not have any liability for the work
done in connection with any Seller's warranty claim unless arising out of
willful misconduct or gross negligence on behalf of Buyer. Any moneys
remaining in the Warranty Fund upon completion of the eighteen (18) month
warranty administration period will be promptly returned to Seller. Buyer will
determine day-to-day warranty administration procedures and decisions,
provided, however, Buyer will consult and cooperate in good faith with
Seller's designated warranty representative about the warranty administration
provided for in this Section 3.5. Seller may elect at any time by giving
written notice to Buyer to terminate the warranty administration function
described herein and upon the effective date of such termination, Buyer shall
have no further obligation to administer warranty claims for any homes closed
prior to the Closing Date and shall return to Seller the remaining balance of
the Warranty Fund.

3.6 Real Property Assets and Real Estate Escrow.

A. Real Property Assets. "Real Property Assets" consists of Owned Real
Property, Contracted Real Property, Existing Real Estate Contracts, Affiliate
Property and Real Property Intellectual Property (in each case, as defined
below) as well as all of the other assets described below, provided, however,
that the Real Property Assets shall not include any Excluded Assets:



1. Seller's right, title, and interest in and to all real property assets reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet or listed in Schedule 3.12(1)(A) of Appendix III of the Agreement, including all of Seller's right, title, and interest in and to all (a) land and lots, homes and buildings (whether finished or under development/construction), model homes, fixtures, and improvements located thereon or attached thereto (the "Owned Real Property"); (b) purchase contracts and option agreements for the purchase of lots or land (collectively, the "Option Agreements") and related escrow instructions and deposits, including capitalized feasibility and similar costs relating thereto (the lots or land to be acquired pursuant to such Option Agreements, the "Contracted Real Property"); and (c) to the extent transferable: easements, franchises, licenses, permits, and rights-of-way appurtenant to or otherwise benefiting, and all development rights, mineral rights, water rights, utility capacity reservations, and other rights and appurtenances affecting or pertaining to, the items described in clauses (a) and (b) (collectively, with the Owned Real Property and the Contracted Real Property, the "Real Property").

2. To the extent transferable: all of Seller's rights, title, and interest in and to all rights and benefits in, to and under all (a) the Option Agreements; (b) sale agreements or other contracts and related escrow instructions and escrow deposits relating to the sale of lots, homes or other aspects of the Owned Real Property; (c) contracts with suppliers, materialman, contractors, subcontractors and others furnishing any work, materials or services to or for any of the Real Property; (d) reimbursement and indemnity agreements pertaining to or of any improvement, performance, payment, maintenance, fidelity, lien release, or other bonds, undertakings or similar sureties relating to or for any of the Real Property; (e) contracts with architects, designers, engineers, planners, environmental consultants, surveyors, and other consultants relating to or for any of the Real Property, including, but not limited to all house plans for any existing or planned community; (f) commission, listing, homebuilding escrow and brokerage agreements relating to or for any of the Real Property; (g) office and storage leases; (h) management service and construction supervisor contracts or agreements relating to or for any of the Real Property; (i) leases related to model home furniture, fixtures and equipment and any model home lease or sale agreements relating to or for any of the Real Property; and (j) all rights under all contracts, agreements or understandings to which any Selling Party is bound relating to the Real Property Assets (collectively, the "Existing Real Estate Contracts");

3. To the extent transferable: all of Seller's rights, title, and interest in and to all (a) architectural, building, and engineering designs, drawings, specifications, and plans, including, but not limited to all house plans for any existing or planned community; (b) all proprietary information or rights including any and all plans, and other project related information of prior and currently active real estate projects, other than to the extent exclusively respecting projects completed, or real property owned and disposed of prior to the Closing Date; (c) goodwill associated therewith; and (d) all agreements or licenses relating thereto, in each case of clause (a), (b) and (c), relating to the Real Property. The foregoing is hereinafter referred to as the "Real Property Intellectual Property"; and



4. To the extent transferable: all of Seller's right, title, and interest in and to all development agreements, pipeline arrangements, approvals, authorizations, certificates, consents, franchises, licenses, permits, rights, variances, subdivision maps, plans, entitlements, and waivers acquired, being acquired, applied for, or used, and all agreements with all environmental, feasibility, archeological, engineering, soils, and other reports of tests or inspections in respect of the Real Property, and any waivers, and approvals from or to any Governmental Authority, department, board, commission, bureau or any other entity or instrumentality, and other authorities in the nature thereof, and all other similar vested rights, all as related to the Real Property.

5. As a corollary to the foregoing, the Selling Parties shall arrange for the preparation and execution prior to Closing of a quitclaim document whereby the Selling Parties (other than Seller) and Patrick B. Madden, and any entities they own or control, transfer and assign any rights they may have to Real Property Assets and related items described in paragraphs (2)-(4) above to Seller and to include any other assets incident to Seller's compliance with its representations in Section 3.11 of Appendix III. Without limiting the foregoing, the Selling Parties covenant and agree that Seller shall thereby convey to Buyer all residential homebuilding assets owned or controlled by Seller and the Selling Parties except to the extent expressly identified as Excluded Assets or as otherwise encompassed by the procedures in paragraph (6) below. Selling Parties further covenant and agree to cooperate after the Closing to carry the intentions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, this Section 3.6A(5) to convey to Buyer the rights, ownership and benefits of all such residential homebuilding assets.

6. Certain Selling Parties (or their affiliates) other than the Seller own or control the lands and lots constituting the Affiliate Property, as defined in Section 3.12(3) of Appendix III. Seller represents and warrants that all real property that falls within the definition of "Affiliate Property" is described on APA Schedule 3.6.A(6). The respective Selling Parties identified on such APA Schedule 3.6.A(6) will prior to the Closing cause the respective entity holding such rights to the Affiliate Property (the "Affiliate Property Owner") to enter into one or more option agreements in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer pursuant to which (i) the respective Affiliate Property Owner will fully entitle and develop the Affiliate Property and (ii) BK Residential Construction, LLC will have the option to acquire on a rolling takedown basis the Affiliate Property subdivided and developed in a finished lot condition pursuant to the terms and conditions of the option agreement(s) (individually, an "Affiliate Option Agreement" and if more than one, collectively, the "Affiliate Option Agreements"). Buyer and the Selling Parties agree that the Affiliate Option Agreement(s) will contain such economic terms to ensure that the purchase price from Buyer for finished lots of the Affiliate Property will generate current normal margins to the Business (and, following the assignment referred to in the next sentence, to Buyer) and contain customary terms, including takedown and warranty provisions consistent with current industry practice in the markets in which the Affiliate Property is located including the material terms reflected on that certain "Takedown Schedule-BK Residential Construction" agreed to by the parties on the date hereof. Each of the Affiliate Option Agreements will be assigned to Buyer at the Closing as a then Existing Real Estate Contract.



B. Escrow. An escrow for the Owned Real Property Assets portion of
transactions (the "Real Estate Escrow") will be established with First
American Title Insurance Company or another mutually agreed upon escrow agent
(the "Real Estate Escrow Agent" or "Title Company"), and Buyer and Seller
shall share equally the escrow fees for this transaction. Real Estate Escrow
Agent, Seller or Buyer requires the execution of additional escrow
instructions, Seller and Buyer agree to execute reasonable additional escrow
instructions; provided, however, those instructions will be construed as
applying only to Real Estate Escrow Agent's engagement. If there are any
conflicts between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the printed
escrow instructions, the terms of this Agreement will control.

3.7 Title Matters.

A. Title Report. APA Schedule 3.7A lists each survey (the "Survey") in
Seller's possession for the Real Property, a copy of which has been provided
to Buyer. Buyer and Seller have requested that Seller's local real estate
counsel provide a current preliminary title report (together with the
documents identified as exceptions to title in such preliminary title report,
individually, a "Report," or collectively, the "Reports") for each parcel or
parcels of Real Property.

B. Title Supplements. To the extent that Buyer elects to obtain any
supplemental reports issued by the Title Company prior to Closing
(collectively, a "Title Report Supplement"), Buyer shall provide a copy of the
Title Report Supplement to Seller.

C. Approved Title Exceptions. Upon receipt of the Reports, Buyer shall have
the right to object in writing to any title matters shown thereon, which
objections will be listed on APA Schedule 3.7C (the "Disapproved Title
Exceptions"). Any exceptions to title disclosed in each Report that are not
objected to by Buyer are referred to in this Agreement as the "Approved Title
Exceptions." In any event the Disapproved Title Exceptions will include all
monetary liens or encumbrances affecting Owned Real Property (other than liens
for year 2014 property taxes, existing improvement district liens or specific
assessments, which shall be prorated through the date Closing occurs). If,
prior to Closing, any of the Disapproved Title Exceptions are not cured by
Seller to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer, then Buyer may either (i)
terminate this Agreement, (ii) accept title subject to the Disapproved Title
Exceptions, or (iii) elect to exclude the Owned Real Property subject to the
Disapproved Title Exceptions and have the Purchase Price adjusted accordingly.
If Buyer has not notified Seller of its election prior to the Closing, Buyer
will be deemed to have accepted title subject to the Disapproved Title
Exceptions, in which case they will thereafter become Approved Title
Exceptions for purposes of the Agreement. In addition, if Title Company issues
any Title Report Supplement prior to the Closing and such Tile Report
Supplement reflects or discloses new or additional exceptions, other than
monetary liens or encumbrances affecting Owned Real Property (as all monetary
liens and encumbrances are all automatically deemed Disapproved Title
Exceptions that are to be paid by Seller at Closing), such exceptions will be
deemed Approved Title Exceptions unless Buyer notifies Seller within five (5)
business days of receipt of the Title Report Supplement



that, in Buyer's reasonable determination, the new or additional exception(s)
would result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Real Estate
Assets or the Business. If Buyer so notifies Seller that a new or additional
exception reflected in a Title Report Supplement would result in a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Real Estate Assets or the Business, the
provisions set forth above in this Section 3.7C shall apply.

D. Title Policies. On the Closing Date, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Title Company or its title insurer to provide
Buyer with (or to be irrevocably committed to provide to Buyer post-Closing)
title policies on all real property purchased hereunder (or assigned to a
landbanker), including specifically (i) an ALTA extended coverage title policy
(a "Title Policy") for the Owned Real Property, and (ii) an ALTA extended
coverage title commitment (a "Title Commitment") for the Contracted Real
Property, in each case, issued by the Title Company or its title insurer,
effective as of the Closing, naming Buyer as insured, in the amount of that
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such portion of the Real Property
in accordance with this Agreement, insuring that the estate or interest
described as the insured estate in each Report is vested in Buyer (in the case
of the Owned Real Property) or is vested in, or controlled by, the optionor or
seller (in the case of the Contracted Real Property), in each case subject to
the Approved Title Exceptions as of Closing. The Title Policy will include
such endorsements issued by the Title Company as Buyer may reasonably require.
Seller, at Seller's expense, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy all of the Title Company's customary requirements for the issuance of
the Title Policies and extended coverage, other than those, if any, within
Buyer's control. The cost of title insurance policies and endorsements shall
be borne by Buyer.

E. Title Insurance Indemnity. Seller agrees to deliver or cause Title Company
to deliver to Buyer, prior to Closing, copies of all indemnities, affidavits
or other agreements or documents executed and/or delivered or to be delivered
by Selling Parties to the Title Company to induce the Title Company (i) to
delete any exception to title shown in Schedule B to any Report, (ii) to
remove any policy conditions or stipulations or exclusions from coverage if
any may appear or be shown on the policy jacket or Schedule B of any Title
Policy, or (iii) to issue any other endorsement or affirmative coverage of any
nature with respect to any such exception to title, conditions or stipulations
to coverage or any exclusions from coverage.

3.8 Selling Parties as Agent for Homes Under Construction and Contract.
Selling Parties agree to act as agent for Buyer after the Closing with respect
to the general contractor, construction and home sale and home sale brokerage
licenses, permits and approvals, held or used by the Business on the Closing
Date, including but not limited to, those held by the Licensed Holders with
respect to (i) homes sold, but not closed, prior to the Closing and (ii) homes
for which construction was started prior to the Closing Date. The Selling
Parties further covenant and agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Licensed Holders to continue to act in such capacities through
the closing and conveyance to the homebuyers of each such home. Buyer agrees
to promptly reimburse Seller for its direct costs and out of pocket
expenditures relating to the Selling Parties' actions in continuing to serve
as agent in the



capacities set forth in this Section 3.8. The Selling Parties further agree to
act as general contractor, sales agent, and sales broker, as necessary, on
behalf of Buyer for homes sold after the Closing Date or for which
construction is started after the Closing Date for a period of not less than
six months for those locations where Buyer is not able to obtain the necessary
licenses and permits by the Closing Date. In furtherance of the agreements set
forth in this Section 3.8, Buyer and Seller agree to enter into a "Transition
Agreement" effective on the Closing Date. The Transition Agreement will
include terms and conditions as reasonably agreed to by the parties, including
that Seller will maintain insurance coverage covering such activities
(including builder's risk and errors and omissions coverage for sales agents
and brokers) and Buyer will indemnify Seller for losses not otherwise covered
by insurance.

3.9 Continuation of Insurance. Seller is continuing to evaluate putting in
place a discontinued operations or tail policy for general liability insurance
for periods after the Closing. If put in place, Seller agrees to ensure that
such policy would: (i) name buyer as an additional insured on such policy and
(ii) not limit the ability of third parties to satisfy any applicable self-
insurance reserve or pay any deductibles. If and to the extent Seller elects
not to purchase such a tail policy (or if purchased, is discontinued), the
Selling Parties agree to indemnify Buyer from any and all liability, loss and
expense Buyer may at any time incur from the date hereof through the
applicable statute of repose period with respect to matters that would have
been covered by such tail coverage if it had been purchased or continued by
Seller, subject to the specific provisions in Sections 6.7 hererof.

3.10 Development Funding Obligations. The Selling Parties agree to cause BK
Residential Ventures to continue to fund development costs for the Enclave at
Airy Springs project in accordance with the Development Agreement for the
Enclave at Airy Springs so as not to impede the takedown of lots or
construction or sale of homes in such project. The Selling Parties represent,
warrant, and covenant to and with Buyer that (i) Seller has provided to Buyer
a true and correct copy of the Development Agreement for the Enclave at Airy
Springs, together with all amendments, waivers, or other changes thereto, (ii)
such Development Agreement provides for funding of development costs
consistent with the budget assumptions for such project provided to Buyer by
Seller (including, without limitation, with respect to the takedown of lots
and construction and sale of homes in such project), and (iii) the Selling
Parties will cause BK Residential Ventures to not agree to any amendments,
waivers, or other changes to such Development Agreement that would have an
adverse impact on the takedown of lots or construction or sale of homes in
such project consistent with the budget assumptions for such project provided
to Buyer by Seller.

3.11 Additional Real Property. Selling Parties hereby covenant and agree with
Buyer that, without the consent of Buyer, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, from the date hereof to the earlier of (i) Closing Date or (ii)
termination of this Agreement, Seller will not acquire or enter into any
purchase, option or other agreement to acquire or lease any real property
other than as disclosed in the Schedules to this Agreement or as otherwise
contemplated in Section 3.6. hereof.



3.12 Repurchase of Certain Lots. The parties acknowledge there are
environmental and/or soil conditions that may impact certain lots in the
Lakeside and Dawson Pointe projects that comprise part of the Owned Real
Property. If Buyer determines, whether before Closing or after Closing, in its
reasonable discretion that these conditions adversely impact its ability to
develop the lots and/or construct and sell homes on such lots (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, an impact that results in costs to remediate the
issues), then Buyer may require Seller to repurchase the impacted lots if they
were part of the Owned Real Property. The Selling Parties agree to cause
Seller to repurchase such lots within 10 days of Buyer's written notice of
such repurchase requirement. The re-purchase price for such lots shall be (i)
for lots purchased prior to the Closing of the book value of such lots, and
(ii) for lots purchased after the Closing, the purchase price Buyer pays for
such lots. Buyer agrees to execute a limited warranty deed to Seller to convey
such lots to Seller pursuant to this repurchase option, subject only to
Buyer's receipt of the calculated repurchase price.

in respect thereof, all representations, and warranties made hereunder or
pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
will survive the Closing and execution, delivery, and recordation of each
Deed.

6.4 Indemnification of Buyer by Selling Parties. Seller and the Seller
Indemnitors will indemnify and defend Buyer and its direct and indirect parent
companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, shareholders, successors and assigns, from and against any and all
costs, expenses, losses, damages, fines, penalties, or liabilities (including,
without limitation, interest which may be imposed in connection therewith,
court costs, litigation expenses, expert and consulting fees, and reasonable
attorneys' and accounting fees) (collectively, "Losses") incurred by them,
directly or indirectly, with respect to, in connection with, or arising from,
the following:

1. a breach by any Selling Party of any representation, warranty, covenant, restriction or agreement made by any Selling Party herein or in any of the Transaction Agreements, or in any certificate or other Closing document delivered by such parties to Buyer hereunder; provided, however, that any breach of any employment or consulting agreement between Buyer and each of Taylor, Patrick B. Madden or Means, as the case may be, shall be subject to indemnification by the person who is a party to such agreement;

2. any Excluded Liabilities as well as the indemnification specified in Section 3.9 hereof; and

3. any Liability arising out of the ownership or operation of the Business through the Closing Date (including Continuing Liabilities to the extent provided herein) other than the Assumed Liabilities.

6.5 Indemnification of Selling Parties by Buyer. Buyer will indemnify and
defend Selling Parties and their direct and indirect parent companies,
subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
shareholders, successors and assigns from and against any Losses incurred by

2. any Assumed Liabilities; and

3. any Liability arising out of the ownership or operation of the Acquired Assets after the Closing Date (other than the Continuing Liabilities to the extent provided herein).

6.6 Procedure for Indemnification of Third Party Claim and Litigation.



A. Notice of Claim. Subject to the following provisions of this Section 6.6,
the party which is entitled to be indemnified hereunder (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give written notice hereunder to the party required to indemnify
(the "Indemnifying Party") promptly, but, in the case of a claim or loss
arising out of a third-party claim against such party, in no event later than
sixty (60) days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of written notice
of any claim as to which recovery may be sought against the Indemnifying Party
because of the indemnity in Sections 3.9, 6.4 or 6.5 above, as applicable,
which notice shall specify (to the extent known) in reasonable detail the
amount of such claim and the relevant facts and circumstances relating
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to indemnification hereunder
shall not be affected by any failure of an Indemnified Party to give such
notice, or delay by an Indemnified Party in giving such notice, unless, and
then only to the extent that, the rights and remedies of the Indemnifying
Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of the failure to give, or delay
in giving, such notice. If the Indemnifying Party wishes to assume the defense
of any claim or litigation by a third party, it shall promptly, but in no
event later than fifteen (15) days following receipt of the written notice
from the Indemnified Party of such claim or litigation, notify the Indemnified
Party of its election. Failure by an Indemnifying Party to notify an
Indemnified Party of its election to defend any such claim or action by a
third party within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Indemnified Party's
written notice of such claim shall be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying
Party of its right to defend such claim or action. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any claim or litigation by a third party, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense thereof, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a claim involves or could have material adverse implications for the
Business as conducted following the Closing, and Buyer is the Indemnified
Party in such case, Buyer may assume the defense of the claim for the account
of the Indemnifying Party subject to procedures in C below.

B. Defense of Claim by Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a claim or litigation by a third party, the Indemnifying Party
will take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement of such claim or
litigation, and will hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any
and all damages caused by or arising out of any settlement approved by the
Indemnifying Party or any judgment in connection with such claim or
litigation. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any claim or
litigation by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of such claim or litigation that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall
not be required to agree to the entry of any judgment or any settlement that
(i) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the
Indemnified Party, (ii) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release
from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation or (iii) provides
for any relief prospectively which restricts or otherwise impacts the
operation of the Business.

C. Defense of Claim by Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense of any such claim or litigation by a third party within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice from the Indemnified Party
to do so pursuant to this Agreement,



or the Indemnified Party has elected to handle the claim as provided in
Section 6.6A above, the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or
litigation in such manner as it deems appropriate, and the Indemnified Party
may settle such claim or litigation on such terms as it may deem reasonably
appropriate (after prior notice of at least two Business Days of such proposed
settlement to the Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for the amount of such settlement and
for all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense against or settlement of such claim or litigation .

D. Participation in Defense of Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.6 to the contrary, the party not primarily responsible for the defense of a
third-party claim or litigation may, with counsel of its choice and at its
expense, participate in the defense of any such claim or litigation.

The cumulative liability of the Seller and the Seller Indemnitors under this Article 6 shall be limited to $21,000,000, provided, however, that the following items should not be subject to this cap limitation: (i) any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.10, 3.11, 3.21 and 3.24 of Appendix III; or (ii) any Excluded Liabilities; or (iii) any Losses relating to a breach of the Non-Disclosure and Non-Compete Agreement as related to claims against the party so breaching such agreement; or (iv) intentional, knowing, or reckless misrepresentations or omissions or like fraud by Seller or the Seller Indemnitors. As an additional cap relating to Losses that arise only under Section 3.9 (and not intended to constitute a cap or limitation to the extent such Losses also arise under the general indemnification in Section 6.4 above), then from the date hereof until the expiration of such indemnity upon the applicable statute of repose referenced therein, the maximum liability of Seller and the Seller Indemnitors under this Article 6 for the Selling Parties' indemnification obligations set forth in Section 3.9 shall be limited to $3,000,000.

5. For purposes of determining any amounts that are subject to indemnification for breaches of representations, warranties, agreements or covenants, any qualifications relating to materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or the like will be disregarded solely for computation of Losses relating to a breach of such provision.

6. The indemnification of the Seller Indemnitors hereunder is agreed and acknowledged to be joint and several to each of the Seller Indemnitors except that any indemnification obligations or Losses arising under a breach of any employment or consulting agreement between Buyer and each of Taylor, Patrick B. Madden or Means, as the case may be, shall be subject to indemnification solely by the person who is a party to such agreement.

B. Set Off. Upon determination of Buyer that it has suffered any Loss subject
to indemnification under this Agreement, Buyer may reimburse the amount of
such Loss from the Holdback Fund. If upon receipt of notice of such
reimbursement (as provided



below in this Section 6.7B) Seller (acting through its Seller Representative)
disputes the amount of Loss, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such difference(s). If the parties are not able to resolve such
differences within 30 days of Seller's receipt of the notice of such Loss, the
parties agree to resolve the dispute consistent with the procedures set forth
in Section 1.5B(6). At the option of Buyer, Buyer may also set off against
amounts payable under the Earn-Out Payments to satisfy indemnification claims
due to Buyer and any shortfalls/deficiencies not deposited by Seller (or the
Selling Parties) into either of the Holdback Fund (pursuant to Section 1.5D)
or the Warranty Fund (pursuant to Section 3.5). Buyer agrees to provide Seller
written notice of any such reimbursement or setoff, which notices shall
specify the claim and the amount thereof.

C. Waiver of Certain Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable law, no party
hereto shall be liable to any other person or entity, either in contract (as
the Indemnifying Person hereunder) or in tort, for any special or punitive
damages, or damages relating to any multiples of earnings, of such other
Person, excepting such items asserted by a third party under a Third Party
Claim.

D. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments; Exclusive Right. Any
indemnification payments made by the parties pursuant to this Section 6 shall
be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price paid by
Buyer for the Assets, unless otherwise required by applicable law. The
provisions of this Section 6 shall be the sole mechanism for any party to
assert monetary claims hereunder.

8.3 Counterparts. This Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and all
certificates, schedules and other documents attached to or deliverable under
such agreements,



may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each counterpart will
constitute an original instrument, but all such separate counterparts will
constitute one and the same agreement.

8.4 Governing Law. The validity, construction, and enforceability of this
Agreement will be governed in all respects by the Laws of the State of
Georgia, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.

8.5 Dispute Resolution. Except as otherwise provided herein, all claims,
disputes, and other matters in controversy (except matters relating to fraud,
intentional misstatements or omissions, or the Employment Agreements between
Buyer and Taylor and Patrick B. Madden as well as the Means Agreement) arising
directly or indirectly out of or connected with the Transaction Agreements,
relating to the breach, termination or validity of the Transaction Agreements,
whether contractual or non-contractual, and whether during the term or after
the termination of this Agreement, unless mutually settled Buyer and Selling
Parties, shall be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution
Procedures attached as Exhibit C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein will prohibit the parties from pursuing equitable remedies, such as
injunctions of specific performance.

8.6 Assignment. This Agreement may be assigned to any corporation or entity
with or into which Buyer may be merged or consolidated or to which Buyer
transfers all or substantially all of its assets, provided that either such
entity is Meritage Homes Corporation or a direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Meritage Homes Corporation and such corporation or entity
assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings of Buyer
hereunder, but no such assignment will relieve Buyer or its successor of its
liability for the respective obligations of Buyer hereunder (including without
limitation those in Section 1.5B above). In addition, Buyer may prior to the
Closing designate one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries to acquire the
Acquired Assets, assume the Assumed Liabilities and otherwise consummate the
transactions contemplated this Agreement. To the extent so designated, the
wholly-owned subsidiary or subsidiaries consummating the transaction shall be
deemed parties to this Agreement as if named herein as Buyer without the need
for further reference or action and shall be entitled to, and obligated by,
the rights and obligations of Buyer hereunder. The Buyer may also require
Seller to assign in whole or in part any parcel of the Owned Real Property or
the Contracted Real Property (including rights and obligations under the
related Existing Real Estate Contract) at or in connection with the Closing,
in each case, to a landbanker or similar entity designed by Buyer. Seller and
the Selling Parties agree to use their reasonable commercial efforts, without
incurring material out-of-pocket costs (not reimbursed by Buyer) to facilitate
the counterparty's consent to such assignment (where no Selling Party is the
owner or contracting selling party under such Existing Real Estate Contracts).
Any assignment in violation of the provisions of this Agreement will be null
and void. No Selling Party may assign its obligations hereunder.

8.7 Gender and Number. The masculine, feminine, or neuter pronouns used herein
will be interpreted without regard to gender, and the use of the singular or
plural will be deemed to include the other whenever the context so requires.



8.8 Schedules and Exhibits. The Schedules (including, without limitation, any
updates to such Schedules prior to the Closing) and Exhibits referred to in
this Agreement and attached to this Agreement are incorporated in this
Agreement by such reference as if fully set forth in the text of this
Agreement.

8.9 Waiver of Provisions. The terms, covenants, representations, warranties,
and conditions of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument
executed by the party waiving compliance. The failure of any party at any time
to require performance of any provisions hereof will, in no manner, affect the
right at a later date to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of any
condition, or breach of any provision, term, covenant, representation, or
warranty contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any
one or more instances, will be deemed to be or construed as a further or
continuing waiver of any such condition or waiver of the breach of any other
provision, term, covenant, representation, or warranty of this Agreement.

8.10 Costs. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if any legal
action or any arbitration or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement
of this Agreement, or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default, or
misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement,
the successful or prevailing party or parties will be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, accounting fees, and other costs incurred in that
action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it or they may
be entitled.

8.11 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing approved by the parties to this Agreement and signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto.

8.12 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants, and
restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will
in no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated and the court will modify this
Agreement or, in the absence thereof, the parties will negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement to preserve each party's anticipated benefits under
this Agreement.

8.13 Binding Effect. Subject to the provisions and restrictions of Section
8.5, the provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and will inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns.

8.14 Construction. References in this Agreement to "Sections," "Articles,"
"Exhibits," "Appendices" and "Schedules" are to the Sections and Articles in,
and the Exhibits, Appendices and Schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise noted.

8.15 Time Periods. Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, the
time for performance of any obligation or taking any action under this
Agreement will be deemed to expire at 5:00 p.m. (Scottsdale, Arizona time) on
the last day of the applicable time period provided for in this Agreement. If
the time for the performance of any obligation or taking any action under this
Agreement expires on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the time for



performance or taking such action will be extended to the next succeeding day
which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

8.16 Headings. The headings of this Agreement are for purposes of reference
only and will not limit or define the meaning of any provision of this
Agreement.

8.17 Access to Records. Buyer will provide Seller with reasonable access to
books, records, and documents transferred to Buyer hereunder for period of
three (3) years from the Closing or such longer time as Seller notify Buyer
that Seller may require for Tax purposes.

8.18 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement, including with respect to representations and warranties, between
the parties pertaining to the subject matter contained in the Transaction
Agreements. All prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations and
understandings of the parties, oral or written, are superseded by and merged
in the Transaction Agreements. No supplement, modification or amendment of the
Transaction Agreements will be binding unless in writing and executed by the
parties thereto.

8.19 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as specifically provided in Section
8.5 of this Agreement and similar provisions in the other Transaction
Agreements, neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction Agreement is
intended to, and none of them shall, create any rights in any other person
other than the parties to such agreements. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, nothing herein or in any other Transaction Agreement is
intended to create, nor shall it create, in the Title Company or any title
insurer any right of subrogation to any rights of Buyer arising from any
representation or warranty of any Selling Party.

business and in keeping with past practices, mortgaged, pledged, or subjected

(10) increased the annualized level of compensation of or granted any bonuses,
benefits, or other forms of direct or indirect compensation (other than in
accordance with plans and programs in place on the date of this Agreement, or
with respect to non-management employees, in the ordinary course of business)
to any employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant, or
adopted, amended or modified any Employee Benefit Plans;



Appendix III - 3

3.10 Tax Matters. All Taxes due and payable by Seller (or, with respect to tax
items of or relating to the Seller, by Seller's ultimate beneficial owners)
have been paid (or are accrued on the applicable Financial Statements or will

relating thereto have been filed. There is no outstanding deficiency or
proposed adjustment for any Taxes asserted or assessed in writing by any
taxing authority against Seller (or, with respect to tax items relating to the
Seller, against Seller's ultimate beneficial owners). Neither Seller nor its
ultimate beneficial owners have consented to extend the time in which any
Taxes may be assessed or collected by any taxing authority, and no extension
of any statute of limitations has been given respecting any Tax items of
Seller. There is no action, suit, taxing authority proceeding, investigation,
review or audit now in progress, or Pending, in each instance regarding any
Taxes of, relating to, or with respect to Seller, and no notice or request for
information from, or with respect to, Seller or Seller's tax items has been
received by any Selling Party. There are no Liens on the assets of Seller
relating or attributable to Taxes (other than Liens for sales and payroll
Taxes not yet due and payable and Liens for non-delinquent real property Taxes

Taxes, has timely remitted such withholdings to the appropriate governmental
authority, and timely filed all forms in connection therewith. The Owned Real
Property and, to the Knowledge of Seller, the Contracted Real Property, is not
and will not be subject to any "roll-back" tax or similar tax subjecting the
owner of such Real Property to any retroactive assessment.

Asset Representations:

Acquired Assets will be transferred at Closing free and clear of all Liens
other than Approved Title Exceptions. All of the Acquired Assets are in good
condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are usable in the
ordinary course of business. The Acquired Assets represent substantially all
of



Appendix III - 4 

the assets of the Business and all of the assets necessary or required by
Buyer to continue to operate the Business as conducted prior to the Closing
Date. Seller owns, or leases under valid leases, all property, machinery,
equipment, and other tangible and intangible assets necessary for the conduct
of the Business. None of the assets attributable to, or necessary to the
operation of, the Business, as conducted immediately prior to the Closing
Date, are held or owned by an entity other than Seller. As of Closing, there
will be no parents, shareholders, members, partners or affiliates of any
Seller that directly own any assets, Permits or other authorizations relating

opposition, cancellation, declaration, infringement, invalidity,
unenforceability, or misappropriation or like claim, action, or proceeding.

conceived any house plans and other architectural works, drawings, blueprints
and designs used by the Business have assigned all rights, title and interest
therein to Seller, and no current or former employees or contractors have
asserted any claim alleging ownership in or other rights to use any
Intellectual Property owned by or created or developed on behalf of Seller,
and Seller is not aware of any reasonable basis for such claim. All house

the Business are owned outright by Seller or are licensed to Seller without
further payment of any fee and may be assigned to Buyer without restriction on
use or any further costs or obligations due thereafter. Seller has the right

business or other entity under common control with Seller, within the meaning
of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate")
currently or has ever maintained, contributed to, been required to contribute
to, or has had any liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to, any
plan that (i) is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, (ii) is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, (iii) is a "multiple employer plan," as defined in Section
3(40) of ERISA, (iv) is a "voluntary employees' beneficiary association," as
defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, or (v) is a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement," as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA. Neither the
Seller, nor any subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is required to provide
security to any Employee Benefit Plan under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.
From and after Closing, except as accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet,
Buyer will have no obligation to contribute to, or any liability in respect
of, any Employee Benefit Plan (as such term is defined below) sponsored or
maintained by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, or to which the Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate was obligated to contribute. Each Employee Benefit Plan has
been established, maintained, operated and administered in all respects in
accordance with its terms and any related agreements, and with the Code, ERISA
and all applicable Laws. The Seller, each subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate
has performed and complied in all respects with their obligations under, or
with respect to, each Employee Benefit Plan and neither the Seller or any
subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, and no fact exists, that would
be expected to result in any liability (including, but not limited to, any tax
liability) with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. No Employee Benefit Plan
that is a "welfare benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA provides
post-employment benefits to any person and all Employee Benefit Plans that are
"welfare benefit plans" are fully insured. All contributions and other
payments required to be made to or by each Employee Benefit Plan under the
terms of that Employee Benefit Plan, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable
Law have been completely and timely made, and all such contributions made have
been and are fully deductible under the Code or other applicable Law and no
such contributions or deductions have been challenged or disallowed by any
Governmental Authority. The execution of, and performance of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement will not either alone or in connection with
any other event(s) result in any payment or funding becoming due, increase the
amount of compensation or benefits payable, or accelerate the vesting of any
benefit or the time of any payment, to or in respect of any current or former
employee, director, officer, or independent contractor of the Seller or any of
its subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates or result in any "parachute payment,"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

insurance policy and fidelity bond, including performance improvement bonds,
maintenance bonds, labor and material bonds and other bonds related to the
Owned Real Property, maintained by Seller with respect to its properties or
the Business, and sets forth the date of expiration of each such policies. All
of such policies and bonds are in full force and effect and Seller is not in
default with respect to its obligations under any of such policies or bonds.
There is no claim of Seller Pending under any of such policies or bonds as to
which Selling Parties have been notified that coverage has been questioned,
denied, or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, there has been no threatened termination of, or material
premium increase with respect to, any of such policies. To the Knowledge of
Seller, the insurance coverage of Seller is customary for entities of similar

EXHIBIT A

NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT

This NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT (this 2014 (the "Effective
Date"), by and among MERITAGE HOMES CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation
(together with its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, "Buyer"),
and BK RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION, LLC, LEGENDARY REALTY and MARKETING, INC.

B. MEANS, STEVEN K. TAYLOR, and Sherry M. Means as Trustee of THE MEANS GIFT
TRUST U/T/D DECEMBER 30, 2012 (collectively the "Restricted Parties"). All
capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in the Purchase Agreement, as defined below.

RECITALS

Seller is engaged in land development, homebuilding, and home sales in the
state of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina (the "Business"). The
Restricted Parties control or are affiliated with the Seller and will each
benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.

Buyer is acquiring the Business pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated
as of July [ ], 2014, among the parties hereto (the "Purchase Agreement").

The Restricted Parties have intimate knowledge of key business information,
practices and relationships relating to the Business, which, if exploited by
the Restricted Parties in contravention of this Agreement, would seriously,
adversely, and irreparably affect the ability of Buyer to continue the
businesses previously conducted by Seller and realize the benefits and assets
Buyer acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

To induce Buyer to close the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement and for the significant consideration to be paid thereunder, the
Restricted Parties have agreed to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement.

In consideration of the premises, the mutual promises and covenants of the
parties set forth herein and in the Purchase Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Restricted Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

AGREEMENT

1.Noncompetition.

(a) During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Parties will not, directly or
indirectly, whether through an affiliate, family member, or otherwise, and
whether in the capacity as a stockholder, partner, member, owner, lender,
officer, beneficiary, director, employee, consultant or otherwise
(collectively, a "Related Party"): 

(i) engage in land or lot development, homebuilding or home sales (including
for-sale low-, mid- and high-rise condominiums and other for-sale attached
housing) within the Restricted Territory (a "Competing Business");

(ii) recruit, hire or discuss employment for a Competing Business with any
person who is, or within the six month period preceding the date of such
activity was, an employee of or dedicated independent contractor to Buyer or
its affiliates or the Business (other than as a result of a general
solicitation for employment);

(iii) solicit any trade, subcontractor, materials or land supplier, consultant
or customer of Buyer or its affiliates or the Business for a Competing
Business or otherwise attempt to induce any such trade, subcontractor,
materials or land supplier, consultant or customer to discontinue or reduce
its relationship with Buyer or its affiliates or the Business; or

(iv) use the name "Legendary", "Legendary Communities", "Legendary Realty",
"Legendary Consulting" and "Legendary Realty and Marketing" or any derivatives
thereof for any land or lot development, homebuilding or home sales business
within the Restricted Territory.

"Restricted Period" shall mean (i) with respect to Seller, Legendary
Consulting, Inc., the Gra Kell Trust and the Means Gift Trust and their
subsidiaries and affiliated entities, from the Effective Date to the 5th
anniversary thereof, and (ii) with respect Richard B. Means and Steven K.
Taylor from the Effective Date until the later of (A) the 5th anniversary of
the Effective Date or (B) one year after their separation from Buyer; provided
however, that the Restricted Parties hereby agree that the Restricted Period
shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of any breach by such
Restricted Party.

"Restricted Territory" shall mean the States of Georgia, North Carolina and
South Carolina.

(b) The Restricted Parties acknowledge and agree, that:

(i) they are willing and able to engage in a business or activity that is not
a Competing Business;

(ii) enforcement of the restrictions set forth in this Section 1 will not be
unduly burdensome to the Restricted Parties;

(iii) the period of time provided for in this Section 1 and the territorial
restrictions and other provisions and restrictions set forth herein are

in the use of the goodwill of the businesses conducted prior to (and to be
continued after) the Effective Date; and 

(iv) damages alone cannot compensate Buyer or its affiliates in the event of a
violation of this Section 1 and, if such violation should occur, injunctive
relief shall be essential for the protection of Buyer or its affiliates.

Accordingly, the Restricted Parties hereby covenant and agree that, in the
event any of the provisions of this Section 1 shall be violated or breached,
each of Buyer and its affiliates shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief
against the party or parties violating such covenants, without bond or
security therefor, in addition to any other right or remedy available by law
or in equity.

(c) During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Parties hereby agree that
upon becoming a Related Party of another enterprise, which is engaged, or is
likely to engage, in a Competing Business, each Restricted Party shall
promptly disclose to such new enterprise the terms of this Agreement, and
shall cause such enterprise to maintain such information in confidence. The
Restricted Parties further agree and authorize Buyer and its affiliates to
notify others, including customers and suppliers of Buyer and the Business and
any such enterprise, of the terms of this Section 1 and of their obligations
hereunder.

2. Non-Compete Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the following exceptions to the restrictions set forth in Section 1 will apply:

(a) In the event that any of Richard B. Means or Steven K. Taylor is
terminated without "Cause" by Buyer, or resigns for "Good Reason" as defined

individuals named in this Section 2(a), to build up to 10 custom homes in the

the-counter market, and such investment does not exceed 3% of the issued and
outstanding voting power or class of security of the issuer.

(c) The Restricted Parties may continue to own any equity interests, notes or
other benefits in any Affiliate Property Owner (as defined in Section 3.6A(6)
of the Purchase Agreement) but only as to: (i) those Affiliate Property Owners
existing as of the Closing who have executed Affiliate Option Agreements that
have been assigned to Buyer, and (ii) only with respect to the activities of
such Affiliate Property Owner contemplated by such option agreements.

(d) Sherry M. Means may continue to hold a 25% membership interest in Milton
Arches, LLC, which holds an interest in the Belvoir Manor joint venture
project managed and developed by Archway Custom Homes and that involves the
current ownership of 11 custom lots in Alpharetta, Georgia and the
construction of custom homes thereon. 

(e) The Restricted Parties may sell to non-affiliated third parties any lots
(i) Seller may actually repurchase from Buyer pursuant to Section 3.12 of the
Purchase Agreement and (ii) representing Affiliate Property not purchased by
Buyer pursuant to the Affiliate Option Agreements.

3. Protection of Information.

(a) The Restricted Parties recognize and acknowledge that Buyer's and Buyer's
affiliates', including, but not limited to, Meritage Homes Corporation,
Confidential Information is a valuable and unique asset of Buyer and its
affiliates and therefore agree that, during the Restricted Period, except as
otherwise required by Applicable Laws, the Restricted Parties will not, and
will use their best efforts to ensure that their respective directors,
officers, employees, advisers, agents, consultants and family members do not,
disclose any Confidential Information concerning the Business, or Buyer or
Buyer's affiliates, including, but not limited to, Meritage Homes Corporation,
to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, for any reason
whatsoever, unless previously authorized in writing to do so by Buyer. It is
understood that Confidential Information shall not include any information
that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
an unauthorized disclosure by the Restricted Parties or that is disclosed by
the Restricted Parties in accordance with the terms of a prior written consent
of Buyer.

(b) In the event that any Restricted Party is requested pursuant to, or
required by Applicable Laws, regulation or rules of any securities exchange or
legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other
information concerning Buyer and its affiliates, the Restricted Parties agree
that they shall provide Buyer with prompt notice of such request or
requirement in order to enable Buyer to seek an appropriate protective order
or other remedy, or to consult with the Restricted Parties with respect to
Buyer taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal
process. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is
obtained (or Buyer waives compliance with the terms of this Section 3), the
Restricted Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to disclose only that
portion of any Confidential Information which the Restricted Parties are
advised by counsel is legally required and shall exercise all reasonable
efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information so disclosed shall be
accorded confidential treatment; provided, however, that failure to notify
Buyer will not expose the Restricted Parties to any additional liability
hereunder.

(c) "Confidential Information" shall mean confidential, proprietary
information or trade secrets of the Business, Buyer and Buyer's affiliates,
including, but not limited to, Meritage Homes Corporation, including without
limitation the following: (1) customer lists and customer information; (2)
internal practices and procedures; (3) financial statements and information
(not generally available to the public); (4) supply of materials information,
including sources and costs; (5) information relating to strategic planning,
land positions, product designs, construction, engineering, purchasing,
finance, marketing, promotion, distribution and selling activities; (6)
information which the Restricted Party has a reasonable basis to consider
confidential or which is treated as confidential; and (7) any 

and all information having independent economic value that is not generally
known to, and not readily ascertainable by proper means by, persons who can
obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.

4. Severability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a court determines that: (a) the Restricted Period is unenforceable as to any particular Restricted Party, the period shall be reduced to the longest period determined by the court to be permitted by law or, if the court fails to do so, to the period ending 3 years from the Effective Date for that Restricted Party (or, if an employee, six months after termination of employment, whichever is longer), and (b) the Restricted Territory is unenforceable as to any Restricted Party, it shall be reduced to the broadest area determined by the court to be permitted by law or, if the court fails to do so, to the Atlanta, Georgia, Greensville-Spartanburg, South Carolina and Charlotte, North Carolina metro areas, in each case plus 25 miles from its borders. Additionally, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable and no such modification will render it enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.

5. Waiver. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

6. Assignment by Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Buyer from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder. Upon such consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the term "Buyer," as used herein shall mean such other corporation or entity, as appropriate, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be assigned by any Restricted Party.

7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the complete agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior written, or prior or contemporaneous oral, understandings or agreements between the parties that may have related in any way to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by Buyer and the Restricted Parties.

8. Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions relating to its validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Georgia.

9. Notices. All notices, consents, and other communications hereunder will be in writing and deemed to have been duly given when (i) delivered by hand, (ii) sent by facsimile transmission (with transmission confirmed), (iii) emailed as provided herein or (iv) when received by the addressee, if sent by Express Mail, Federal Express, or other express delivery service (with delivery confirmation), in each case to the appropriate addresses and facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and facsimile numbers as a party may designate as to itself by notice to the other):

EXHIBIT C



Dispute Resolution Procedures

For the purpose of these Dispute Resolution Procedures, Buyer will act and be
treated as one party and Selling Parties (to the extent their interests
coincide and each is involved in a dispute, controversy or claim, whether
contractual or non-contractual ("Dispute") with Buyer) will act and be treated
as one party, with the Selling Parties' Representative acting for and on
behalf of Selling Parties. In the event one or more Selling Parties is not
involved in any Dispute, such non-involved parties shall not be considered to
be parties under this Exhibit C. To the extent the Selling Parties do not have
interests that coincide, these procedures shall be modified as necessary to
recognize that there may be more than two parties to any Dispute to be
resolved pursuant to this Exhibit C. All capitalized terms contained herein
but not otherwise defined will have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Master Transaction Agreement.

1.Negotiation. The parties will first attempt to settle a Dispute by a meeting
of two (or more if the interests of the Selling Parties do not coincide)
designated representatives of each party within five (5) days after receipt by
a party of a request from the other party for such a meeting ("Request").

2.Mediation. If such Dispute cannot be settled at such meeting either party
within five (5) days of such meeting (or within ten (10) days of receipt of a
Request if no meeting takes place) may give a written notice (a "Mediation
Notice") to the other party (or parties) requesting mediation and setting
forth the nature of the Dispute. The mediation will be held in Dallas, Texas,
unless the parties agree otherwise, under the Commercial Mediation Rules of
the AAA in effect on the date of the Mediation Notice ("Mediation Rules"). The
parties shall have ten (10) days from receipt by a party of a Mediation Notice
to agree on a mediator. Failing such timely agreement, the mediator shall be
appointed by the following procedure: The AAA office in Dallas, Texas shall
provide the parties with a list of nine persons who are or have been
attorneys, who reside in United States, and who are otherwise qualified by
education and experience to mediate the parties' Dispute. If the parties
cannot agree to a mediator from this list, the mediator shall be chosen by
each side striking a name (with the first to strike being chosen by lot) until
only one name remains. That person shall be appointed by the AAA as the
Mediator. If there are three parties with diverse interests, the Buyer, on the
one hand, and the parties that are members of the Selling Parties, on the
other hand, each will be treated as one party for purposes of striking
potential mediators from such list until the Mediator is selected. If the
Dispute has not been resolved by mediation as provided above within sixty (60)
days after the appointment of the Mediator (or within ninety (90) days of the
receipt of a Mediation Notice, whichever comes sooner), then, on the Request
of any Party the Dispute will be determined by arbitration in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3 hereof. The fees and expenses of the AAA and the
Mediator shall be apportioned by the AAA in accordance with its then
applicable Mediation Rules.

3.Arbitration. Any Dispute that is not timely settled through mediation as
provided in Section 2 above will be finally and exclusively resolved by
arbitration in Dallas, Texas, unless the parties agree otherwise. The
arbitration shall be administered by the AAA office in Dallas, Texas, under
its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of the Dispute Notice
(the "Rules"), as modified by the provisions of this Section 3. There shall be
a single neutral, impartial 

arbitrator selected by the parties by mutual agreement. In the event the
parties are unable to reach agreement upon an arbitrator within thirty (30)
days after any Mediation or notice from a party to select an arbitrator, then,
if there are two parties, the parties shall select a single arbitrator from a
list of nine arbitrators drawn by the parties at random from the "independent"
(or "gold card") list of retired judges provided by the AAA. If the parties
are unable to agree within thirty (30) days upon an arbitrator from the list
of nine so drawn, then the parties shall each strike names alternatively from
the list, with the first to strike being determined by lot. After each party
has used four strikes, the remaining name on the list shall be the arbitrator.
If such person is unable to serve for any reason, the parties shall repeat
this process until an arbitrator is selected. If there are three parties with
diverse interests, the Buyer, on the one hand, and the parties that are
members of the Selling Parties, on the other hand, each will be treated as one
party for purposes of striking potential arbitrators from such list until the
arbitrator is selected. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq. The arbitrator shall base the award on
applicable Law and judicial precedent. The award shall be in writing and shall
include the findings of fact and conclusions of Law upon which the award is
based. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(a)Upon the application by either party to a court for an order confirming,
modifying or vacating the award within sixty (60) days of receipt thereof, the
court shall have the power to review whether, as a matter of law based on the
findings of fact determined by the arbitrator, the award should be confirmed,
modified or vacated in order to correct any errors of Law made by the
arbitrator. In order to effectuate such judicial review limited to issues of
Law, the parties agree (and will stipulate to the court) that the findings of
fact made by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties and will
serve as the facts to be submitted to and relied on by the court in
determining the extent to which the award should be confirmed, modified or
vacated. For the purpose of this section permitting judicial review of the
award, the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Federal and State courts located in Dallas, Texas.

(b)By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court
of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral
attachment, or other provisional order in aid of arbitration proceedings and
the enforcement of any award (including but not limited to a preliminary
injunction enforcing the ownership or confidentiality provisions contained in
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements). Without prejudice to
such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a
national court, the arbitrator shall have full authority to grant provisional
remedies and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate
any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to award damages
for the failure of any party to respect the arbitrator's orders to that
effect.

4.Costs and Attorneys' Fees. If either party fails to proceed with arbitration
as provided herein or unsuccessfully seeks to stay such arbitration, or if no
appeal of an award is timely filed in accordance with Section 3(a) herein, if
either party fails to comply with any arbitration award within thirty (30)
days of receipt thereof, or is unsuccessful in vacating or modifying the award
pursuant to a petition or application for judicial review, the other party
will be entitled to be awarded costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
paid or incurred by such other party in 

successfully compelling arbitration or defending against an attempt to stay
such arbitration defending against an attempt to vacate or modify an
arbitration award and/or successfully enforcing such award.

5.No Amendment of Agreement. In no event shall the arbitrator have the power
or jurisdiction to amend, modify or vary the terms of this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Agreements.
