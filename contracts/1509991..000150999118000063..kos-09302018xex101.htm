expenses paid to the Company Group by Third Party joint interest owners that
constitute advance payments by such Third Parties for operations with respect
to the Assets that are not incurred or conducted prior to the date Seller
delivers to Purchaser the draft final settlement statement;

(C) with respect to any Imbalances where the Company Group is overproduced as
to Hydrocarbons or has underdelivered Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the
aggregate amount owed by Third Parties to the Company Group for





such Imbalances as of the Effective Time on the basis of the applicable
Settlement Price;

(D) the amount of all Suspense Funds held by Seller or its Affiliates (other
than the Company Group), to the extent such funds are not transferred to
Purchaser's or the Company Group's control at the Closing; and

(E) the amount of any Pre-Effective Time Non-Income Taxes unpaid as of the
Effective Time.

(d) All adjustments and payments made pursuant to this Article 2 shall be
without duplication of any other amounts paid or received under this
Agreement.

(e) For purposes of allocating Hydrocarbon production (and accounts receivable
with respect thereto), (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be produced
from the Leases, Units or Wells when they pass through the inlet flange of the
first measurement meter of the first applicable LACT unit and (i) gaseous
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be produced from the Leases, Units or Wells
when they pass through the inlet flange of the first downstream sales meter.
Seller and the Company Group shall use reasonable interpolative procedures to
arrive at an allocation of Hydrocarbon production when exact meter readings,
gauging or strapping data are not available.

(f) Surface use or damage fees and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling on or before, or after, the Effective Time.

(g) "Earned" and "incurred," as used in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, shall be
interpreted in accordance with accounting recognition guidance under the
Accounting Principles.

Section 2.5 Closing Payment and Post-Closing Adjustments.

(a) Not later than four Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a draft preliminary settlement statement (the
"Preliminary Settlement Statement") setting forth Seller's good faith estimate
of the Adjusted Purchase Price as of the Closing Date after giving effect to
all adjustments set forth in, and showing the calculation of each adjustment
under, Section 2.3. The Preliminary Settlement Statement shall include a list
of the Persons, accounts and amount of disbursements that are to be made from
the Closing Payment to (i) the holders of Credit Document Indebtedness
outstanding as of the Closing, any Post-Effective Time Indebtedness
outstanding as of the Closing and any other Indebtedness For Borrowed Money
outstanding as of the Closing, (i) the Persons under the Transaction Costs
Payoff Instructions, and (i) after deducting the amounts in clauses (i)
through (ii), Seller. Seller shall supply to Purchaser reasonable
documentation in the possession of Seller to support the items for which
adjustments are proposed or made in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
delivered by Seller and a brief explanation of any such adjustments and the
reasons therefor. Within two Business Days after receipt of Seller's draft
Preliminary Settlement Statement, Purchaser will deliver to Seller a written
report containing all changes that Purchaser proposes to be made to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any, together with a brief explanation of
any such changes. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon





by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at the
Closing; provided that if the Parties cannot agree on all adjustments set
forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, then any
adjustments as set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement as presented
by Seller will be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at the Closing.
A non-binding example form of the Preliminary Settlement Statement is attached
hereto as Exhibit F.

(b) Not later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with respect
to any Transaction Costs of a type described in clause (i) of the definition
thereof, Seller shall submit to Purchaser, the Transaction Costs Payoff
Instructions.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but not later than
the 90th day following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a draft final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement
Statement") setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price
after giving effect to all adjustments set forth in, and showing the
calculation of each adjustment, under Section 2.3. Seller shall, at
Purchaser's request, make reasonable documentation available to support the
final figures. Within 60 days following receipt of Seller's Final Settlement
Statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written report
containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made in such statement, if
any ("Dispute Settlement Statement"). Any changes not so specified in such
Dispute Settlement Statement shall be deemed waived and Seller's
determinations with respect to all such elements of the Final Settlement
Statement that are not addressed specifically in such Dispute Settlement
Statement shall prevail. If Purchaser fails to timely deliver a Dispute
Settlement Statement to Seller, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by
Seller will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties,
and will be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit
or arbitration. The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of
the Adjusted Purchase Price no later than 30 days following Seller's receipt
of Purchaser's Dispute Settlement Statement delivered hereunder. In the event
that the Parties cannot reach agreement as to the final settlement statement
of the Adjusted Purchase Price within such period of time, either Party may
refer the items of adjustment which are in dispute or the interpretation or
effect of this Section 2.5(c) to the Accounting Referee for review and final
determination by arbitration. The Accounting Referee shall conduct the
arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the AAA, to the extent such rules do not conflict with
the terms of this Section 2.5(c). The Accounting Referee's determination shall
be made within 15 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the
amount of any adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, the Accounting
Referee shall be bound by the terms of Section 2.3 and may not increase the
Adjusted Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor decrease
the Adjusted Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of Adjusted Purchase
Price adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest
(except to the extent expressly provided for in this Section 2.5), or
penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall
each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller
and Purchaser shall each bear one-half of the fees, costs, and expenses of the
Accounting Referee. Within 5 Business Days after the earlier of the expiration
of Purchaser's 60-day review period without delivery of a Dispute Settlement
Statement or the date on which the Parties or the Accounting Referee finally
determine the Adjusted Purchase Price, if





the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Seller in writing an amount in cash equal to such excess or if
the Closing Payment exceeds the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, Seller and
Purchaser shall (i) provide the Transfer Agent with the applicable Transfer
Agent Documentation and (i) deliver to the Transfer Agent joint written
instructions to the Transfer Agent to (A) transfer from the Holdback Amount to
Purchaser an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Equity (rounded up to
the nearest number of whole shares) calculated by dividing (x) the amount of
such excess by (y) the Current Price and (A) remove the Restrictive Legends on
such shares.

(d) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller
in preparation of the final settlement statement of the Adjusted Purchase
Price by furnishing invoices, receipts, reasonable access to personnel, and
such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by Seller to facilitate
such process post-Closing; provided that such cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business of the Purchaser or the Company
Group.

(e) All adjustments and payments made pursuant to this Article 2 shall be
without duplication of any other amounts paid, credited, debited, or received
under this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 2.5 shall
not apply to any disputes with respect to Title Benefits or Defects, which
shall be governed by Section 3.2.

Section 2.6 Allocation of Purchase Price. Within 30 days after the Cut-Off
Date, Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree
upon an allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price (and any other items
properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) among
the Assets in accordance with the classes of assets set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338-6 and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. If Seller and Purchaser
are able to agree on such allocation, (i) the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to update the allocation in a manner consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code and as mutually agreed following any adjustment to
the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and (i) Seller and
Purchaser agree to be bound by such allocation and shall report the
transactions contemplated hereby on all applicable Tax Returns (including, but
not limited to IRS Form 8594) consistently with such allocation (and any
adjustment thereto), unless otherwise required by applicable Laws; provided,
however, that neither Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and
discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax Proceedings in
connection with such allocation. If Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on an
allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price, each party shall use its own
allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price as it deems appropriate.

Section 2.7 Withholding. Each of Purchaser and members of the Company Group
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any applicable U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Laws. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to or deposited
with the relevant Governmental Authority by Purchaser or any member of the
Company Group, such withheld





amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

ARTICLE 3 
TITLE MATTERS

Section 3.1 Title Matters. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 5.17,
SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING TITLE MATTERS, AND,
SUBJECT TO THIS Article 3 AND Article 13, PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND
EACH MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP, HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, AND DISCHARGES
EACH MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, COSTS, LIABILITIES,
LOSSES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN
OR UNKNOWN, ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY PERIODS OF TIME WHICH ANY MEMBER OF THE
PURCHASER GROUP MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED ON, RELATING TO OR
ARISING OUT OF, ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLER
GROUP, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MEMBER
OF THE COMPANY GROUP'S OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S TITLE TO, OR DEFICIENCY IN TITLE
TO, ANY OF THE ASSETS. Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that Article 3
and Article 13 (solely with respect to obligations relating to Section 5.17)
sets forth Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any Defect
and the failure of any member of the Company Group or any other Person to have
title to any of the Assets (whether Defensible Title or otherwise).

Section 3.2 Defects; Adjustments.

(a) Notice of Defects. As a condition to Purchaser asserting any claim with
respect to any alleged Defect, Purchaser must deliver to Seller a valid Notice
or Notices (each a "Defect Notice") with respect to such alleged Defect to
Seller on or before 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on September 7, 2018 (the
"Defect Deadline"). In order to be a valid Defect Notice as to each alleged
Defect, each such notice shall be in writing and must include:

(i) a description of the alleged Defect;

(ii) a description of each Lease, Unit or Well subject to such alleged Defect;

(iii) the Allocated Value of each Lease, Unit or Well subject to the alleged
Defect;

(iv) Purchaser's good faith reasonable estimate of the Defect Amount
attributable to such Defect and the computations and information upon which
Purchaser's estimate is based; and

(v) providing, in all material respects, Reasonable Documentation in
Purchaser's or Purchaser's Representatives possession or control supporting
Purchaser's assertion and claim of such Defect.





PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED, AND COVENANTS THAT IT
SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ALL RIGHTS UNDER THIS ARTICLE 3 AND ANY AND ALL
DEFECTS (AND ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE ATTRIBUTABLE
THERETO) FOR WHICH SELLER HAS NOT RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT DEADLINE A
VALID DEFECT NOTICE THAT SATISFIES ALL OF THE CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SET
FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3.2(A).

(b) Notice of Title Benefits. As a condition to Seller asserting any alleged
Title Benefit, Seller must deliver to Purchaser on or prior to the Benefit
Deadline, a written notice (each a "Title Benefit Notice") including:

(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit;

(ii) a description of each Lease, Unit or Well subject to such alleged Title
Benefit;

(iii) the Allocated Value of each Lease, Unit or Well subject to the alleged
Title Benefit;

(iv) Seller's good faith reasonable estimate of the Title Benefit Amount
attributable to such Title Benefit and the computations and information upon
which Seller's estimate is based; and

(v) providing, in all material respects, Reasonable Documentation in Seller's
or any member of the Company Group's possession or control supporting Seller's
assertion and claim of such Title Benefits.

SELLER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED, AND COVENANTS THAT IT
SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL TITLE BENEFITS (AND ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO
THE UNADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE ATTRIBUTABLE THERETO) FOR WHICH PURCHASER HAS
NOT RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE BENEFIT DEADLINE A VALID TITLE BENEFIT NOTICE
THAT SATISFIES ALL OF THE CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS
SECTION 3.2(b).

(c) Option to Cure Defects. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at Seller's sole cost, to cure or remove, on or prior
to the date 90 days after the Defect Deadline, any Defects asserted in a valid
Defect Notice. Seller shall be deemed to have cured or removed a validly
asserted Defect if the Assets affected by such alleged Defect are free of all
Defects as of the date 90 days after the Defect Deadline. If any validly
asserted Defect is not cured or removed as elected by Seller, or if Seller and
Purchaser cannot agree as to whether such Defect has been cured or removed,
and it is determined by the Defect Referee that such Defect is not cured by
the date 90 days after the Defect Deadline, the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be adjusted by the Defect Amount attributable to such Defect, or, if
after the Closing, transfer from the Holdback Amount to Purchaser shall be
made in the manner provided for in Section 3.2(g). Seller's attempt to cure or





remove a Defect shall not constitute an obligation to cure or attempt to cure
such Defect or a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the validity, nature, or
value of, or cost to cure, such Defect.

(d) Defect Amounts. The diminution of value of the Assets attributable to any
valid Defect that actually burdens, encumbers, or affects an Oil and Gas
Property (the "Defect Amount") shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Defect Amount;

(ii) if a Defect is a Lien that is liquidated in amount, then the Defect
Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Defect from the
Company Group's interest in the affected the Lease, Unit or Well;

(iii) if a Defect affecting any Lease, Unit or Well represents a negative
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Lease, Unit
or Well and (A) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-3, as applicable, for such Lease, Unit or Well and in
such case there is a proportionate decrease in the actual Working Interest
with respect to such Lease, Unit or Well from the Working Interest stated on
Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-3, as applicable, for such Lease, Unit
or Well, then the Defect Amount shall be equal to the product of (1) the
Allocated Value of such Lease, Unit or Well multiplied by (1) a fraction, the
numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-3, as applicable,
for such Lease, Unit or Well minus (II) the actual Net Revenue Interest as to
such Lease, Unit or Well, and the denominator of which is (y) the "Net Revenue
Interest" percentage stated on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-3, as
applicable, for such Lease, Unit or Well; provided that if the Defect does not
affect the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit
A-2 or Exhibit A-3, as applicable, for such Lease, Unit or Well throughout its
entire productive life, the Defect Amount determined under this Section
3.2(d)(iii) shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

(iv) if the Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden, or charge
upon or other defect in title as to the Lease, Unit or Well of a type not
described in Section 3.2(d)(i), through (iii), the Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Lease, Unit or
Well so affected, the portion of the Company Group's interest in such Lease,
Unit or Well affected by the Defect, the legal effect of the Defect, the
potential present value economic effect of the Defect over the life of such
Lease, Unit or Well (including any reductions of Decommissioning obligations
as a result of such Defect), the values placed upon the Defect by Purchaser
and Seller, the estimated capital and operational costs and expenses (or
reduction or increases thereof) attributable to the Company Group's Working
Interest, and such other factors as are necessary to make an evaluation and
determination of such value;

(v) if a Defect is reasonably susceptible to being cured, the Defect Amount
with respect to any Defect shall in no event be greater than the amount that
can reasonably be





shown to be the reasonably estimated present value (discounted at a rate of
8%) of the reasonable lowest-cost response to cure such Defect;

(vi) the Defect Amount with respect to a Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Defect Amount
hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation
of the Adjusted Purchase Price; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for all Defect Amounts
attributable to Defects with respect to each Asset shall not exceed the
Allocated Value (if any) of such Asset (after giving effect to any applicable
adjustments due to prior Defects).

(e) Title Benefit Amounts. The "Title Benefit Amount" for any Title Benefit
shall be determined as follows:

(i) if a Title Benefit applicable to any Lease, Unit or Well with a positive
Allocated Value represents a positive discrepancy between (A) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for such Lease, Unit or Well and (A) the Net Revenue Interest
percentage stated on Exhibit A‑1, Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-2, as applicable,
for such Lease, Unit or Well, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be equal to
(1) the product of the Allocated Value of such Lease, Unit or Well multiplied
by (1) a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the
actual Net Revenue Interest of such Lease, Unit or Well minus (II) the Net
Revenue Interest percentage stated on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-2,
as applicable, for such Lease, Unit or Well, and the denominator of which is
(y) the Net Revenue Interest percentage stated on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or
Exhibit A-2, as applicable, for such Lease, Unit or Well; provided that if the
Title Benefit does not affect the Net Revenue Interest percentage stated on
Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit A-2, as applicable, for such Lease, Unit
or Well throughout its entire productive life, the Title Benefit Amount
determined under this Section 3.2(e)(i) shall be reduced to take into account
the applicable time period only; and

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a benefit of a type not described in
Section 3.2(e)(i), the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of the Lease, Unit or Well so affected, the
portion of the Company Group's interest in the Lease, Unit or Well affected by
the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
present value (discounted at a rate of 8%) of the positive economic effect of
the Title Benefit over the life of the affected Lease, Unit or Well (including
any increases in Decommissioning obligations as a result of such Title
Benefit), the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Purchaser and Seller,
and such other factors as are necessary to make an evaluation and
determination of such value.

(f) Individual Threshold and Defect Threshold. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(i) There shall be no adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or
transfers out of the Holdback Amount under Section 3.2(g) for any Defect or
Defects (or any related claims) to the extent the Defect Amount for any valid
individual Defect is less than the





Individual Threshold (it being agreed that the Individual Threshold represents
a threshold and not a deductible); and

(ii) With respect to all valid Defects where the Defect Amount thereof exceeds
the Individual Threshold and all such Defect Amounts (together with Damages
pursuant to Section 13.2(b) with respect to Seller Non-Fundamental
Representations or Section 13.2(e)) also exceeds the Defect Threshold (it
being agreed that the Defect Threshold represents a threshold and not a
deductible), the adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or transfers out
of the Holdback Amount under Section 3.2(g) shall include all such Defect
Amounts.

(g) Sole and Exclusive Remedies for Defects. Subject to Seller's right to
dispute the existence of a Defect and the Defect Amount asserted with respect
thereto, in the event that any valid Defect is not waived in writing by
Purchaser or is not cured on or prior to the date 90 days after the Defect
Deadline, then with respect to all uncured Defects for which the Defect Amount
with respect thereto exceeds the Individual Threshold and also exceeds the
Defect Threshold, (i) if a Defect Amount is final pursuant to Section 3.2(i)
prior to the Closing, the Cash Purchase Price reflected in the Preliminary
Statement shall be decreased by the sum of the aggregate Defect Amounts
attributable to such Defects and (i) if a Defect Amount is not yet final
pursuant to Section 3.2(i) prior to the Closing, once a Defect Amount is final
pursuant to Section 3.2(i), Seller and Purchaser shall (A) provide the
Transfer Agent with the applicable Transfer Agent Documentation and (A)
deliver joint written instructions to the Transfer Agent to (1) transfer from
the Holdback Amount to Purchaser an aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Equity (rounded up to the nearest number of whole shares) calculated by
dividing the amount of the aggregate Defect Amounts attributable to such
Defects by the Current Price (subject to Section 13.6(c) and Section 13.6(d))
and (1) remove the Restrictive Legends on such shares.

(h) Remedies for Title Benefits. Subject to Purchaser's right to dispute the
existence of a Title Benefit and the Title Benefit Amount asserted with
respect thereto, adjustments or increases to the Unadjusted Purchase Price due
to a valid Title Benefit shall be subject to the same individual threshold
amount and the same aggregate threshold amount as provided for under Section
3.2(f) for Defects. As such, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased
by the sum of the aggregate Title Benefit Amounts attributable to all such
Title Benefits to the extent the Title Benefit Amount for each Title Benefit
exceeds the Individual Threshold (applicable to Defects) and all such Title
Benefit Amounts also exceed an amount equal to the Defect Threshold, in which
case the adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall include all such
Title Benefit Amounts and (i) if a Title Benefit Amount is final pursuant to
Section 3.2(i) prior to the Closing, the Cash Purchase Price reflected in the
Preliminary Statement shall be increased by the sum of the aggregate Title
Benefit Amount and (i) if a Title Benefit Amount is not yet final pursuant to
Section 3.2(i) prior to the Closing, once a Title Benefit Amount is final
pursuant to Section 3.2(i), Purchaser shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller in writing an
amount in cash equal to such Title Benefit Amount.

(i) Disputed Defects.

(i) Seller and Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to agree prior to and
after the Closing on the interpretation and effect of this Article 3 and the
validity, cure or amount





of any Title Benefits, Title Benefit Amounts, Defects and Defect Amounts. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the scope, interpretation, and
effect of this Article 3, the validity, cure, or amount of any Title Benefits,
Title Benefit Amounts, Defects, or Defect Amounts by the Closing Date, then,
subject to Section 3.2(d), no adjustment shall be made to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price at Closing and any post-Closing payment due to Seller or
Purchaser shall be made in accordance with Section 3.2(f), Section 3.2(g) and
Section 3.2(h). If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the scope,
interpretation and effect of this Article 3, the validity, cure, or amount of
any Title Benefits, Title Benefit Amounts, Defects, or Defect Amounts, by the
date 60 days after the Closing Date, then, subject to Section 3.2(f), Section
3.2(g) and Section 3.2(h), all such disputed interpretations and effect of
this Article 3 and all Title Benefits, Title Benefit Amounts, Defects, and
Defect Amounts shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this
Section 3.2(i). During the 10 Business Day period following such date 60 days
after the Closing Date, disputes as to the interpretation and effect of this
Article 3 and all Title Benefits, Benefit Amounts or Defect Amounts in dispute
shall be submitted to the Defect Referee for resolution through arbitration as
provided hereafter.

(ii) The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be
conducted in accordance with, but not under the auspices or jurisdiction of,
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section. The Defect Referee's determination
shall be made within 60 days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without a right of appeal. In
making a determination, the Defect Referee shall be bound by the rules set
forth in this Article 3 and may consider such other matters as in the opinion
of the Defect Referee are necessary or helpful to make a determination;
provided, however, in determining the existence or amount of any Defect or
Defect Amount, Purchaser may not submit any evidence, records, materials,
data, or information that was not included in a valid Defect Notice delivered
to Seller by the Defect Deadline, unless requested to do so in writing by the
Defect Referee. Additionally, the Defect Referee may consult with and engage
any disinterested Third Party to advise the Defect Referee, including title
attorneys and petroleum engineers.

(iii) In rendering his or her award, the Defect Referee shall be limited to
selecting either Seller's position or Purchaser's position on each of the
disputed Title Benefits, Title Benefit Amounts, Defects, or Defect Amounts.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Defect Referee shall have
exclusive, final, and binding authority with respect to the scope of the
Defect Referee's authority with respect to any dispute arising under or
related to this Article 3 or any disputed Title Benefits, Title Benefit
Amounts, Defects, or Defect Amounts and in no event shall any dispute as to
the authority of the Defect Referee to determine any such disputes be subject
to resolution or the provisions of Section 14.4. The Defect Referee shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the interpretation and
effect of this Article 3 and any and all specific disputed Title Benefit
Amounts or Defect Amounts submitted by any Party and may not award any
damages, interest, or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Purchaser shall bear one-half





of the fees, costs, and expenses of the Defect Referee, and Seller shall be
responsible for the remaining one-half of the fees, costs, and expenses of the
Defect Referee.

ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING SELLER

Subject to the provisions of this Article 4 and the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the exceptions and matters set forth on the Disclosure
Schedules, Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the Execution
Date and the Closing the matters set out in this Article 4 (it being
understood that the representations and warranties set forth in this Article 4
are made after giving effect to the Restructuring as if it occurred
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement):

Section 4.1 Organization, Existence and Qualification. Series Holdco is duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware and has all organizational powers necessary to enable it to use its
legal or other business names, own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its
properties and other assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.
Series Holdco is a series limited liability company under the Laws of the
State of Delaware. Series Seller is a validly designated and established
series of Series Holdco, and has all organizational powers necessary to enable
it to use its legal or other business names, own, lease or otherwise hold and
operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse
Effect. Series Holdco has not designated any series other than the Series
Sellers. Each Seller is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. No Seller has conducted any business other
than its formation, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Restructuring Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

Section 4.2 Power. Each Seller has the limited liability company power to
enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Other than such votes,
approvals or consents obtained prior to the execution of this Agreement, there
are no votes, approvals, consents or other proceedings of the equityholders of
such Seller necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of, or the
performance by such Seller of its obligations under, this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 4.3 Authorization and Enforceability. The execution, delivery, and
performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each
Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Seller
(and all Transaction Documents required to be executed and delivered by such
Seller





at the Closing shall be duly executed and delivered by such Seller) and this
Agreement constitutes, and at the Closing such Transaction Documents shall
constitute, the valid and binding obligations of such Seller, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally as well as to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

Section 4.4 No Conflicts. Except as required by the HSR Act or, as set forth
on Schedule 4.4, the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents by each Seller and the consummation of the

ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY GROUP

Subject to the provisions of this Article 5 and the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the exceptions and matters set forth on the Disclosure
Schedules, Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the Execution

understood that the representations and warranties set forth in this Article 5
are made after giving effect to the Restructuring as if it occurred

organizational powers necessary to enable it to use its legal or other
business names, own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and
other assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where
the failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company Group, taken as a whole. Each member
of the Company Group is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, which jurisdictions are set forth on Schedule 5.1
opposite the name of each member of the Company Group, except for those

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Seller has heretofore provided to Purchaser true and complete copies

Section 5.2 Power. Each Drum Entity has the requisite power to enter into and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction

votes, approvals, consents or other proceedings of the equityholders of any
Drum Entity (for the avoidance of doubt, both before and after the

delivery of, or the performance by the Drum Entities of their obligations
under, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 5.3 Authorization and Enforceability. The execution, delivery, and
performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Drum
Entity. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Drum
Entity (and all Transaction Documents required to be executed and delivered by
such Drum Entity at the Closing shall be duly executed and delivered by such
Drum Entity) and this Agreement constitutes, and at the Closing such
Transaction Documents shall constitute, the valid and binding obligations of
each Drum Entity, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy or other
similar Laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally as well
as to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Section 5.4 No Conflicts. Except as required by the HSR Act or, as set forth
on Schedule 5.4, the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents by Seller and each member of the Company

give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
right (including right to payment), benefit or obligation of a member of the
Company Group or to a loss of any right (including right to payment), benefit
or obligation to which such member is entitled under any provision of any
Contract binding upon such member, except in each case of the foregoing

accordance with normal industry practice, where the value to the Business of
any trade secrets and confidential information is contingent upon maintaining
the confidentiality thereof, to protect the confidentiality of such trade
secrets and other confidential information owned by the members of the Company
Group and contained in the Company Intellectual Property. The members of the

with all applicable Laws related to the collection, use, storage, processing
and disclosure of any personally identifiable information in the possession
and control of the Company Group and collected and stored by or on behalf of
the Business.

(e) To the Knowledge of Seller, the IT Assets operate and perform in a manner
that permits the members of the Company Group to conduct the Business as

reasonable actions, consistent with current industry standards, to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and security of the IT Assets (and all information
and transactions stored or contained therein or transmitted thereby) against

transmitted thereby) that has not been fully remedied or replaced prior to the
date hereof, where such breach, unauthorized access, interruption or

under this Agreement and hereby absolutely, irrevocably, primarily and
unconditionally guarantees the due, prompt and faithful performance of such
undertakings, obligations and required acts by the Seller (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, all payment obligations of Seller under or arising out of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to Section

severally liable for all duties, obligations and Liabilities of each other
under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which they are a party
and (a) Purchaser may rely upon the action of any of Series I Seller, Series
II Seller and Series III Seller for Seller with respect to (i) receiving and
forwarding of notices and communications pursuant to this Agreement and
accepting service of process; and (i) giving or agreeing to any and all
consents, waivers and amendments deemed under this Agreement.

Section 8.2 Access.

(a) Upon execution of this Agreement until the Closing, Seller shall give
Purchaser, its Affiliates, and each of their respective directors, managers,
officers, agents, auditors, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers,
environmental consultants and other authorized representatives ("Purchaser's
Representatives") reasonable access to the Records and financial and operating
data in Seller's or any member of the Company Group's possession and any
Assets, operated by any member of the Seller Group, in each case during, as
applicable, Seller's or the Company Group's normal business hours, solely for
the purpose of conducting a confirmatory review of the Assets and assessing
the environmental condition of the Assets, in each case to the extent that
Seller or the Company Group may provide such access without (i) violating
applicable Laws or breaching any Contracts or (i) waiving any legal privilege
of Seller or any member of the Company Group, or its or their counselors,
attorneys, accountants, or consultants or violating any obligations of Seller
or the Company Group to any Third Party (except that, prior to withholding any
such information, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing of the nature of
the information being withheld and take (at no cost or risk to Seller) any
actions as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser to implement alternate
arrangements (including entering into confidentiality agreements or joint
defense agreements, redacting parts of documents or preparing "clean"
summaries of information) in order to allow Purchaser access to such
information to the fullest extent reasonably practicable under the
circumstances). Such access shall be granted to Purchaser on the premises of
the Assets that are operated by the Company Group; provided, however, in no
event shall Seller or the Company Group be obligated to provide, and Purchaser
and its Representatives shall have no right to receive or review (A) prior to

Assets and any pricing assumptions, forward pricing estimates, price decks or
pricing studies related thereto, (A) prior to Closing, any internal reserve
reports and/or internal estimates of any quantities of Hydrocarbons with

commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost or risk to Seller) to promptly
request and obtain any consents or waivers necessary for Purchaser and
Purchaser's Representatives to obtain access to such Assets. All
investigations and due diligence conducted by Purchaser or any of Purchaser's
Representatives with respect to the Assets shall be conducted at Purchaser's
sole cost, risk, and expense and any conclusions made from any examination
done by Purchaser or any of Purchaser's Representatives shall result from
Purchaser's own independent review and judgment. Seller and any of its
designees shall have the right to accompany Purchaser and Purchaser's
Representatives whenever they are on site on the Assets. Purchaser's
investigation and review shall be conducted in a manner that reasonably
minimizes interference with the ownership or operation of the Assets or the
Business and Purchaser's on-site inspection right with respect to the
environmental condition of the Assets shall be limited to conducting a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment in accordance with the ASTM International
Standard Practice Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment Process (Publication Designation: E1527‑13) or a similar visual or
desktop assessment that does not include sampling or testing of any
environmental media at such Assets ("Phase I"). Purchaser shall not be
entitled to conduct any invasive or intrusive environmental testing, or
sampling on the Assets ("Phase II"), without the consent of Seller, such
consent to be granted, conditioned, or withheld at the sole discretion of
Seller. Purchaser shall furnish to Seller free of costs, a copy of all draft
and final reports and test results prepared by or for Purchaser related to
Purchaser's diligence and investigation of the Assets, including any and all
Phase I, Phase II, or further environmental assessments relating to any of the
Assets as soon as reasonably possible after such report is prepared. Purchaser
shall obtain, with Seller's reasonable assistance, from any applicable
Governmental Authorities and Third Parties all permits necessary or required
to conduct any approved invasive activities permitted by Seller. Seller shall

pursuant to approved invasive activities. If the Closing does not occur,
Purchaser shall (1) promptly return to Seller or destroy all copies of the
Records, reports, summaries, evaluations, due diligence memos, and derivative
materials related thereto in the possession or control of Purchaser or any of
Purchaser's Representatives and (1) shall keep and shall cause each of
Purchaser's Representatives to keep, any and all information obtained by or on
behalf of Purchaser confidential, except, in each case, as otherwise required
by Law.

(b) Purchaser may not contact customers or potential customers of any member
of the Company Group without the consent of Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), other than in the ordinary
course of Parent's business consistent with its past practice.

(c) Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each member of
the Seller Group and all such Persons' stockholders, members, managers,
officers, directors, employees, agents, lenders, advisors, representatives,
accountants, attorneys, and consultants from and against any and all Damages
payable to Third Parties (including court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees) to the extent attributable to, arising out of or relating to access to
the Records, any offices of Seller, or the Assets by Purchaser or any of
Purchaser's Representatives after the Execution Date, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS,
DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES ARE CAUSED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT
LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP.





(d) Upon completion of Purchaser's due diligence, Purchaser shall, at its sole
cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller, the Company Group
or any of their respective Affiliates, (i) repair all damage done to the
Assets directly as a result of Purchaser's due diligence conducted after the
Execution Date, (i) restore the Assets to the approximate same condition than
they were prior to commencement of Purchaser's due diligence conducted after

result of Purchaser's due diligence conducted after the Execution Date, and

or on behalf of Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's due diligence
conducted after the Execution Date. Any disturbance to the Assets (including
the leasehold associated therewith) to the extent directly resulting from

corrected by Purchaser.

(e) During all periods that Purchaser or any of Purchaser's Representatives
are on the Assets or the Company Group's premises, Purchaser shall maintain,

held by Purchaser. Coverage under all insurance required to be carried by
Purchaser hereunder shall (i) be primary insurance, and (i) provide for five
days prior notice to Seller in the event of cancellation or modification of
the policy or reduction in coverage. Upon prior written request by Seller,

the Assets or premises of Seller, the Company Group or any of their respective
Affiliates.

materially delay the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents; or

(i) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 8.5 Closing Efforts and Further Assurances.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller and
Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause the conditions precedent of Seller (in the case of Purchaser) and of
Purchaser (in the case of Seller) set forth in Article 9 to be satisfied
(provided that the commercially reasonable efforts of a party shall not
obligate a party to waive any such condition), (i) obtain all necessary
Consents, (including the expiration or termination of any waiting periods)
from Governmental Authorities





and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental Authorities (and, in the case of filings required to be made
pursuant to the HSR Act, making such filings not later than 10 Business Days
after the Execution Date) and take all steps as may be necessary to avoid, or
to have terminated, if begun, any action, suit or proceeding by any
Governmental Authority by the End Date, (i) execute and deliver additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and (i) defend any
investigations, actions, suits or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to avoid the entry of, or
to have reversed, terminated, lifted or vacated, any stay, temporary
restraining order or other injunctive relief or order entered by any
Governmental Authority that could prevent or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.5 or otherwise,
Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken (including by its Affiliates), any
and all steps and to make, or cause to be paid (including by its Affiliates),
any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a
Governmental Authority may assert under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case,
so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, including,
without limitation, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any businesses, assets, Securities, product lines or properties
of Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or the Company Group or any Securities in any
joint venture held by Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or the Company Group, (i)
creating, terminating or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights
or obligations of Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or the Company Group and (i)
otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would limit Purchaser's
(or its Affiliates') freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, Securities,
product lines or properties of Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or the Company
Group or any Securities in any joint venture held by Purchaser (or its
Affiliates) or the Company Group (each of the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iii), a "Regulatory Remedial Action"); provided, however, neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to agree to any Burdensome
Condition.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Seller and
Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) furnish to the
Other Party as promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for
any application or other filing to be made by the Other Party pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (i)
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from,
and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or
documentation that may be requested by, the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or
by any other Governmental Authority in respect of such registrations,
declarations and filings or such transactions, (i) promptly notify the Other
Party of any material communication between that Party and the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Authority, (i) discuss with and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, permit the Other Party (and its counsel) to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the Other Party's reasonable comments in
connection with, any proposed filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ, or
any other Governmental Authority or,





in connection with any proceeding by a private party to any other Person,
relating to any regulatory Law or any investigation or other action, suit or
proceeding pursuant to any regulatory Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) not participate or agree to participate in any
meeting, telephone call or discussion with the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
relating to any regulatory Law or any investigation or other action, suit or
proceeding pursuant to any regulatory Law in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby unless it, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consults with the Other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the Other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, telephone call or
discussion, (i) furnish the Other Party promptly with copies of all
correspondence and communications relating to any regulatory Law or any
investigation or other action, suit or proceeding pursuant to any regulatory
Law between them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on
the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or
members of their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (i) cooperate in good
faith with the Other Party in connection with any such registrations,
declarations and filings and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Authority under the HSR
Act or any other regulatory Law with respect to any such registration,
declaration and filing or any such transaction. Anything to the contrary in
this Section 8.5(c) notwithstanding, materials provided to the Other Party or
its outside counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries or the members of the Company
Group or as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser agree not to
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, except with the prior consent of the Other Party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall bear any filing fees in
connection with any filings made pursuant to the HSR Act, other than in
connection with the Restructuring, which shall be deemed to be a Transaction
Cost.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.5 shall require,
or be construed to require Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
members of the Company Group, but in the case of the Company Group subject to
completion of the Closing and pursuant to any agreement reached by Purchaser
with respect to the Company Group for periods following the Closing) to agree
to any Regulatory Remedial Action or CFIUS Remedial Action or sell, divest,
discontinue, hold separate or limit any assets, businesses or interests,
terminate, modify, or create any ventures, terminate or modify any existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations, effectuate any other changes
or restructurings, create any contractual rights or obligations or firewalls,
refrain from making any investment or acquisition, or any conditions relating
to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests.

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Section 8.5
(other than clauses (d) and (e)) shall not apply to any matters relating to
the DPA, CFIUS or the CFIUS Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement (including this Section 8.5):





(i) In no event shall Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates (including Parent and any of its Affiliates) or its and their
respective Representatives initiate any communication with the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States, any member agency thereof or any
representative, agent or employee thereof (collectively, "CFIUS") acting under
the DPA, regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that if CFIUS initiates any inquiry, communication, review or request
to submit a joint declaration or voluntary notice ("CFIUS Notice") under the
DPA, such Party shall promptly inform the Other Party of such inquiry or
communication and the following obligations shall become effective. Purchaser
and Seller shall take commercially reasonable efforts to persuade CFIUS that
there is no national security threat associated with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that no CFIUS Notice is necessary. If
Purchaser believes in good faith that it cannot persuade CFIUS that it is not
necessary to submit a CFIUS Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to persuade CFIUS to allow the transaction to
close as promptly as practicable, pending any review or investigation, and the
Purchaser and Seller shall submit as promptly as practicable a complete CFIUS
Notice that is in full compliance with the DPA (the "Requested CFIUS Filing").
Seller and Purchaser shall each, to their fullest ability, comply with the
provisions of the DPA during the pendency of the CFIUS review or
investigation, including with respect to any required timeframe for responding
to a CFIUS request for information. Purchaser and Seller and their respective
Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take any and all
steps advisable, necessary or desirable to finally and successfully obtain the
CFIUS Approval as promptly as practicable and in no event later than the End
Date, including but not be limited to the following (provided, however, in no
event shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be required to agree to any
Burdensome Condition): proposing, negotiating, committing to, entering into
and effecting, by mitigation agreement, voting trust agreement or proxy
agreement, letter of assurance, security control agreement, special security
arrangement, restrictions or actions that after the Closing would limit
Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' freedom of action, ownership, control,
influence, management or access over the business, property or assets of the
Company Group or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (and, in each case, to
enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
any of the foregoing) (a "CFIUS Remedial Action").

(ii) In the event that CFIUS takes any action or threatens to take any action
(prior to or after the submission of the CFIUS Notice) to challenge, suspend
or prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to prevent or
delay the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall take any and all actions
necessary, including but not limited to any CFIUS Remedial Action to avoid or
resolve such challenge or threatened suspension or prohibition, provided,
however, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
agree to any Burdensome Condition. Purchaser and Seller shall be jointly
entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with CFIUS after consulting
with each other.

(iii) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 8.5(e) to obtain CFIUS Approval:





(A) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with
any filing, submission, or other written communication and in connection with
any review or investigation or other inquiry under the DPA, including by
allowing the other party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance
and comment on drafts of filings, submissions, and other written
communications, provided that such advance review is not required where it
would reasonably prevent the Parties from satisfying a deadline imposed by
CFIUS or the communication was initiated by CFIUS and it was impracticable to
provide the Other Party an opportunity to participate.

(B) to the extent permitted by Law, promptly inform the other party of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to CFIUS, by
promptly providing copies to the other party of any such written
communications, and of any communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(A) to the extent permitted by Law, use commercially reasonable efforts to
permit the other party to review in advance any written communication that it
gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, telephone
call or conference or communication with CFIUS or any agency, division or
branch of the United States Government regarding the DPA review or
investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that materials exchanged under (i), (ii) and (iii) may be redacted
(A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Purchaser or the Company
Group (or any of their Affiliates), (B) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns and (C) to remove any personal
identifying information, as defined in the DPA; and

(B) not attend or participate in any meetings with CFIUS without the other
party, unless otherwise requested by CFIUS or as agreed by the Parties.

(iv) The parties may designate, as they deem advisable and necessary, any
sensitive information materials required to be provided to the other under
this Section 8.5(e) as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the party providing such materials or its counsel.

(v) "CFIUS Approval" means that either:

(A) Seller and Purchaser each shall have received any of the following: (A) a
written determination from CFIUS that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not subject to the DPA; or (A) a written confirmation from CFIUS
of the completion of the review and, if applicable, investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and a written determination from
CFIUS that there





are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or

(B) (A) the period of time for any applicable review or investigation pursuant
to the DPA shall have expired and the President of the United States shall not
have taken action to block or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (A) the President of the United States
shall have provided written notice of his decision not to take such action.

Section 8.6 Amendment of the Disclosure Schedule.

(a) From time to time prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Seller may at its option supplement or amend and deliver
updates to (or add schedules to) the Disclosure Schedules as necessary to
complete or correct any information in such Schedules or in any representation
or warranty in Article 4 or Article 5 (each, a "Seller Schedule Update");
provided that, in the event of any Seller Schedule Update, (i) if Seller
acknowledges that as a result of the facts disclosed in such Seller Schedule
Update Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 12.1(b) and (i) Purchaser elects to consummate the Closing, and the
Seller Schedule Update pursuant to this Section 8.6(a) relates to any matter
first arising after the date of this Agreement, then, such Seller Schedule
Update shall be deemed to amend the Disclosure Schedules prepared by Seller
and delivered to Purchaser hereunder. If Seller does not acknowledge that
Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1(b), then such Seller Schedule Update shall not be deemed to be effective
for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) From time to time prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Purchaser may at its option supplement or amend and deliver
updates to (or add schedules to) the Disclosure Schedules as necessary to
complete or correct any information in such Schedules or in any representation
or warranty in Article 6 (each, a "Purchaser Schedule Update"); provided that,
in the event of any Purchaser Schedule Update, (i) if Purchaser acknowledges
that as a result of the facts disclosed in such Purchaser Schedule Update,
Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1(c) and (i) Seller elects to consummate the Closing, and the Purchaser
Schedule Update pursuant to this Section 8.6(b) relates to any matter first
arising after the date of this Agreement, then such Purchaser Schedule Update
shall be deemed to amend the Disclosure Schedules prepared by Purchaser and
delivered to Seller hereunder. If Purchaser does not acknowledge that Seller
has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c), then
such Purchaser Schedule Update shall not be deemed to be effective for
purposes of this Agreement.

Section 8.7 Press Releases. Any initial press release with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release mutually
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser. Thereafter, Seller and Purchaser shall
consult with each other and provide each other with the opportunity to review
and comment upon any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby or this Agreement and Seller and
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, issue
any such other press release or other public statements prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing
agreement related to the trading of the shares of Purchaser on any national
securities exchange,





in which case the Party proposing to issue such press release or make such
public announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the Other Party and provide the Other Party with an
opportunity to review and comment on the content of the proposed disclosure,
which comments such Party shall consider in good faith, acting reasonably,
before issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement;
provided, however, that (i) each of Seller and Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates may make press releases or public announcements concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby if the substance of such
releases or announcements was previously disclosed in previous press releases
or announcements made by Seller and/or the Purchaser in compliance with this
Section 8.7, (i) Purchaser and its Affiliates may make any public statements
in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or analysts or
those participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so long as the
substance of such statements was previously disclosed in previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Purchaser and/or
Seller and their respective Affiliates in compliance with this Section 8.7 and
(i) Purchaser and its Affiliates may make statements to Governmental
Authorities or any Third Party holding preferential rights to purchase, rights
of consent, or other rights that may be applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably necessary to provide notices,
seek waivers, amendments, or terminations of such rights, or seek such
consents. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall be liable for the compliance of
its Affiliates with the terms of this Section 8.7.

Section 8.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all expenses incurred by Seller in connection with or related to
the authorization, preparation, or execution of this Agreement, and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to
the Closing, including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, and
financial advisers employed by Seller, shall be borne solely and entirely by
Seller, and all such expenses incurred by Purchaser shall be borne solely and
entirely by Purchaser.

Section 8.9 Records. Purchaser shall preserve and keep a copy of all Records
in Purchaser's or the Company Group's possession for a period of at least
seven years after the Closing Date. After such seven year period, before
Purchaser shall dispose of any such Records, Purchaser shall give Seller at
least 90 days' Notice to such effect, and Seller shall be given an
opportunity, at Seller's cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any
part of such Records as Seller may select. From and after Closing, Purchaser
shall provide to Seller, at Seller's expense, reasonable access to such books
and records as remain in Purchaser's possession and reasonable access to the
Assets and other properties and employees of Purchaser in connection with
matters relating to the ownership or operations of the Assets on or before the
Closing Date, or any claims or disputes (a) amongst any members of the Seller
Group or (a) with any Third Parties.

Section 8.10 Change of Name; Removal of Name. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary:

(a) from and after Closing, Purchaser agrees, on behalf of Purchaser and each
member of the Company Group, that they (i) shall have no right to use the name
"First Reserve" or any Trademark Rights related thereto or containing or
comprising the foregoing, including any name or mark confusingly similar
thereto or a derivative thereof (collectively, the "Subject Marks"), and





(i) will not at any time market, promote, advertise or offer for sale any
products, goods or services utilizing any of the Subject Marks or otherwise
hold themselves out as having any affiliation with Seller or any of its
Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing shall prevent, restrict or
otherwise limit Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from making general
statements regarding the historical relationship between the Company Group and
Seller or any of its Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after Closing, and in any event, no later than 60 days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Company Group shall: (1) change the
legal name of each member of the Company Group to a name which does not
include any Subject Marks and file all documentation reasonably necessary to
change the legal name of each member of the Company Group in all applicable
jurisdictions; and (1) remove, strike over, cover or otherwise obliterate all
Subject Marks from all materials, including, without limitation, any vehicles,
business cards, schedules, stationary, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other materials.

(b) from and after Closing, Seller agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that they (i) shall have no right to use the name "Deep Gulf
Energy" or any Trademark Rights related thereto or containing or comprising
the foregoing, including any name or mark confusingly similar thereto or a
derivative thereof (collectively, the "Drum Marks"), and (i) will not at any
time market, promote, advertise or offer for sale any products, goods or
services utilizing any of the Drum Marks or otherwise hold themselves out as
having any affiliation with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including,
after Closing, the Company Group); provided, however, that nothing shall
prevent, restrict or otherwise limit Seller or any of its Affiliates from
making general statements regarding the historical relationship between the
Company Group and Seller or any of its Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after Closing, and in any event no later
than 60 after the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall: (1) change
their legal names to a name which does not include any Drum Marks and file all
documentation reasonably necessary to change such legal names in all
applicable jurisdictions; and (1) remove, strike over, cover or otherwise
obliterate all Drum Marks from all materials, including, without limitation,
any vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationary, packaging materials,
displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer software and
other materials.

Section 8.11 Seismic Licenses.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that one or more members of the Company Group holds
the data and geophysical licenses and permits described on Schedule 8.11 (each
a "Seismic License"). Pursuant to the terms of such Seismic Licenses, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder may require the
consent of the applicable licensor, or the payment of one or more transfer,
assignment or change of control fees or payments unless the applicable member
of the Company Group cancels or terminates such Seismic License. Within 20
Business days following the Execution Date, with Seller's reasonable
assistance and cooperation, Purchaser shall determine which Seismic Licenses
should be designated on Part A of Schedule 8.11 and which Seismic Licenses
should be designated on Part B of Schedule 8.11.

(b) With respect to those Seismic Licenses to be described on Part A of
Schedule 8.11, Purchaser has elected that at or after Closing the applicable
member of the Company Group pay





to the applicable Third Party under such Seismic License any and all transfer,
assignment or change of control fees or payments required under such Seismic
Licenses in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder (other those that the Third Party expressly designates in writing
result from to the Restructuring, in which case such fees or payment shall be
considered Transaction Costs), in no event shall such payment of fees or
payments result in any downward reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase Price and
Purchaser and the Company Group shall, after Closing, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each member of the Seller Group from any and all Damages arising
out of the payment, mispayment or failure to pay such fees and payments,
except to the extent the Third Party under such Seismic License expressly
designates in writing that such fees or payments result from the Restructuring
or any action taken during the Pre-Closing Period (other than the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than the Restructuring), in which case such fees and payments shall be
considered Transaction Costs and shall result in downward reduction to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(c) With respect to those Seismic Licenses to be described on Part B of
Schedule 8.11, Seller shall, at its option, elect to cause the Company Group
either to cancel and terminate such Seismic Licenses and destroy and/or return
to the applicable counterparties under such Seismic Licenses any and all data,
information and records required to destroyed or returned under the terms
thereof or assign such Seismic Licenses to Seller or its designee and such
Seismic Licenses shall be treated as Excluded Assets hereunder; provided that
any and all transfer, assignment or change of control fees or payments
required to be paid (or that are paid) by the Company Group under such Seismic
Licenses in connection with their cancelation, termination or assignment as
contemplated by this Section 8.11(c), shall be considered Transaction Costs
and shall result in downward reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

Section 8.12 Employee Matters.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is 24 months after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, provide each individual who is an employee of any member of
the Company Group as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "Continuing
Employee") with: (i) base salary or hourly wages, as applicable, that are no
less than the base salary or hourly wages provided to such Continuing Employee
as of the time immediately prior to Closing and (i) for the period after
December 31, 2018, (A) annual cash bonus opportunities, (A) long-term equity
incentive compensation opportunities and (A) other employee benefits (other
than severance benefits) that are, in each case, no less favorable than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates.
During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2018, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain the Company
Plans on terms and conditions no less favorable than those in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, including with regard to (x) employer
contribution levels, (y) annual bonus amounts and performance metrics (which
bonus amounts shall be pro-rated for the period between the Effective Time and
December 31, 2018) and (z) paid time off, including policies with respect to
accrued, unused paid time off. If any Continuing Employee has accrued, unused
paid time off under the applicable Company Plan as of December 31, 2018,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, pay out to such Continuing
Employee such accrued,





unused paid time off, which payout shall occur on Purchaser's or its
Affiliate's first regularly scheduled pay date that is on or after January 1,
2019.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans or arrangements (including
under any Company Plan or any other applicable 401(k), medical, dental, life
insurance, vacation, leave or severance plan) provided, sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (collectively, "Purchaser
Plans") in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate on or
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, recognize all service of such Continuing Employee with the Company Group
and any predecessor employer as if such service were with Purchaser for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for benefit
accrual purposes (except for vacation and severance); provided, however, that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service or
(i) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Plan.

(c) With respect to any Purchaser Plans that are "employee welfare benefit
plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (collectively, "Purchaser Welfare
Plans") in which a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate on or after
the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to: (i) waive
all pre-existing condition limitations, waiting period provisions, payments
required to avoid a waiting period, actively-at-work requirements and any
other restriction that would prevent immediately or full participation by any
Continuing Employee, in each case, to the same extent such limitations,
requirements and restrictions did not apply or were satisfied under the
corresponding Company Plan prior to the Closing Date and (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to give effect to claims incurred, amounts paid by and
amounts reimbursed to any Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date when
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limits under the
Purchaser Welfare Plans following the Closing Date for the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs, in each case, to the same extent recognized under
the corresponding Company Plan prior to the Closing.

(d) The Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to each Continuing
Employee whose employment with the Purchaser or its Affiliate terminates
pursuant to an Involuntary Termination during the 18-month period immediately
following the Closing Date with a cash severance payment in an amount equal to
the base salary or hourly wages, as applicable, that such employee would have
been eligible to receive if he or she had remained continuously employed by
the Purchaser or its Affiliate through the end of such 18-month period (the
"Severance Payment"), which Severance Payment shall be payable in a lump sum
within 60 days following the date of such termination, subject to such
Continuing Employee's execution and non-revocation of a customary and
reasonable release of claims in favor of the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Company Group) (which release may include customary and lawful
non-disclosure restrictions but which release shall not introduce new terms
with respect to non-competition or non-solicitation of customers or
suppliers); provided, however, that if such Continuing Employee has entered
into an employment, severance or change in control agreement with any member
of the Company Group or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or otherwise
participates in any other Company Plan or Purchaser Plan that provides for
severance pay (an "Other Severance Arrangement") and such employee is eligible
for severance pay or other benefits pursuant to such Other Severance
Arrangement as a





result of his or her Involuntary Termination, then the Purchaser or its
Affiliate shall provide such employee with either (x) the severance pay and
other benefits provided for under Other Severance Arrangement (and not the
Severance Payment provided for under this Section 8.12(d)) if such severance
pay and other benefits under the Other Severance Arrangement exceed the
Severance Payment provided for in this Section 8.12(d) or (y) the Severance
Payment provided for in this Section 8.12(d), offset by the amount of any
severance payable to such Continuing Employee under the Other Severance
Arrangement. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "Involuntary
Termination" means any termination of such Continuing Employee's employment
with the Purchaser or its Affiliate which results from (i) a termination by
the Purchaser or its Affiliate without "cause" (as defined in the Parent
Equity Plan) or (i) a resignation by such employee on or before the date which
is 75 days after the date upon which such employee receives notice of a (A)
reduction in such employee's base compensation or employee benefits (provided
that the provision of employee benefits by Purchaser and its Affiliates in
accordance with Section 8.12(a)(ii) shall not constitute grounds for an
Involuntary Termination), (A) material diminution in such employee's authority
or responsibilities, (A) change in the location of such employee's principal
place of employment by more than 50 miles from the location where such
employee was principally employed immediately prior to the Closing Date or (A)
Purchaser's or its Affiliate's material breach of such employee's employment
agreement with a member of the Company Group, if any; provided, that (1) the
event described in clauses (A) through (D) above arose without such employee's
written consent, (1) the Continuing Employee provides Purchaser with written
notice specifying the occurrence of such event within 30 days after such event
first occurs and (1) Purchaser and its Affiliates fail to cure such event
within 30 days after receipt of such written notice from the Continuing

manager or officer of each member of the Company Group (in all of their
capacities) (collectively, the "Company Group Indemnified Parties") arising
under the Governing Documents of the applicable members of the Company Group
in existence on the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individual. From and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless (and advance expenses to) the

insurance coverage exceeds 300% of such annual amount, the Company Group shall
obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

(c) The provisions of this Section 8.17 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Company Group Indemnified Party and (i)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. Purchaser shall pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Company Group Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity obligations
provided in this Section 8.17 unless it is ultimately determined that such
Company Group Indemnified Party is not entitled to such indemnity.





(d) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, if Purchaser, or any
of its successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in

necessary or advisable so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, regulation
or provision in Purchaser's or Parent's Governing Documents on such
transactions. As used in this Agreement, "Takeover Laws" means any

"Disqualified Individual") would be entitled to any payment or benefit as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events), and (1) such payment or benefit could potentially
constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or could

(i) use its best efforts to obtain a binding written waiver by such
Disqualified Individual (each, an "Excess Parachute Waiver") of any portion of
such parachute payment as exceeds 2.99 times such individual's "base amount"

this Section 8.22 and in no event shall any dispute as to the authority of the
Mechanical Integrity Referee to determine any such disputes be subject to
resolution or the provisions of Section 14.4. The applicable Mechanical
Integrity Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of

Restrictive Legends on such shares.

ARTICLE 11 
TAX MATTERS

Section 11.1 Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees. Purchaser shall bear and pay
(a) any sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary, registration, excise, or
similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") incurred or imposed with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Subject Securities, and (a) all required filing and
recording fees and expenses in connection with the filing and recording of the
assignments, conveyances, or other instruments required to convey the Subject
Securities to Purchaser. Seller shall bear all Transfer Taxes incurred or
imposed with respect to the Restructuring. Seller and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, the amount of any Transfer Taxes, and, if required by
applicable Law, join in the execution of any Tax Returns for any Transfer
Taxes.

Section 11.2 Tax Returns.

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in the preparation of, (i)
all Tax Returns for Income Taxes of the Company Group that do not include any
Post-Closing Income Tax Period, (i) all Tax Returns for Non-Income Taxes of
the Company Group that do not include any Post-Effective Time Non-Income Tax
Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practice and without a change of any election or any accounting method that
could reasonably be anticipated to have an adverse effect on a Post-Closing
Income Tax Period or a Post-Effective Time Non-Income Tax Period, as
applicable, except, in each ease, to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Laws, and Seller shall pay, or cause the Company Group to pay, all
Seller Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns. Seller shall permit
Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing it and
shall reasonably and in good faith consider such revisions to such Tax Returns
as are reasonably requested by Purchaser.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Company Group for all Straddle Tax Periods that are required to be filed after
the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions of the due date). Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice and
without a change of any election or any accounting method that could
reasonably be anticipated to have an adverse effect on a Pre-Closing Income
Tax Period or Pre-Effective Time Non-Income Tax Period, as applicable, except,
in each ease, to the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws. At least 30
days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return (other than (i) Tax
Returns that are due less than 30 days after the Closing Date which shall be
provided as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and (i)
Tax Returns relating to sales, use, payroll, or other Taxes that are required
to be filed contemporaneously with, or promptly after, the close of a Tax
period, which shall be provided promptly after filing), Purchaser shall
deliver a draft of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation
and workpapers, to Seller for its review and comment on items that relate to a
Pre-Closing Income Tax Period or Pre-Effective Time Non-Income Tax Period, as
applicable. If Seller objects to any such item on any such Tax Return, it
shall, within 10 days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Purchaser in
writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and
stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a
notice of objection is duly delivered, Purchaser and Seller shall





negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such
items. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach such agreement within 10
days after receipt by Purchaser of such notice of objection, the disputed
items shall be resolved by the Accounting Referee, and the provisions of
Section 2.5(c) shall apply to the Accounting Referee's review and
determination, mutatis mutandis. If the Accounting Referee is unable to
resolve any disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax
Return shall be filed as prepared by Purchaser and then amended to reflect the
Accounting Referee's resolution. Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser for
any Seller Taxes shown as due and payable on any such Tax Return (or any
amended Tax Return filed following resolution of a dispute by the Accounting
Referee) in cash and/or shares of Parent Common Equity determined in
accordance with the provisions under Article 13. To the extent that the amount
of Taxes shown as due and payable on any amended Tax Return filed following
resolution of a dispute by the Accounting Referee for which Seller would be
obligated to indemnify Purchaser under Section 13.2 is less than the amount
that was shown as due and payable on the previously filed Tax Return,
Purchaser shall promptly return to Seller an amount equal to the difference,
in a pro rata amount of cash and/or shares of Parent Common Equity as received
by Purchaser pursuant to the previous sentence (determined in a manner
consistent with which Seller's payment pursuant to the previous sentence was
determined).

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns
of the Company Group that are not described in (a) or (b) shall be exclusively
within the control of Purchaser.

Section 11.3 Straddle Period Income Taxes. To the extent permitted or required
by applicable Law, the tax year of each member of the Company Group with
respect to Income Taxes that includes the Closing Date shall be treated as
closing on (and including) the Closing Date. To the extent such treatment is
not permitted by applicable Law, in the case of Income Taxes of any member of
the Company Group that are payable with respect to any Straddle Tax Period,
the portion of any such Income Taxes that is attributable to the portion of
such Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date shall be the amount that
would be payable if the Straddle Tax Period ended with (and included) the
Closing Date.

Section 11.4 Non-Income Taxes.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Pre-Effective Time Non-Income Taxes"
means all Non-Income Taxes attributable to any Pre-Effective Time Non-Income
Tax Period, and (i) "Post-Effective Time Non-Income Taxes" means all Non-
Income Taxes attributable to any Post-Effective Time Non-Income Tax Period.

(b) For purposes of determining the amounts of any Pre-Effective Time Non-
Income Taxes and any Post-Effective Time Non-Income Taxes: (i) Non-Income
Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of Hydrocarbons
(other than such Non-Income Taxes described in clause (iii)) shall be
allocated to the period in which the severance or production giving rise to
such Non-Income Taxes occurred, (i) Non-Income Taxes that are based upon or
related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than
such Non-Income Taxes described in clause (i) or (iii)), shall be allocated to
the period in which the transaction giving rise to such Non-Income Taxes
occurred, and (i) with respect to Non-Income Taxes not described in clauses
(i) or (ii), the amount





of Pre-Effective Time Non-Income Taxes shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Non-Income Taxes for the entire Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Tax
Period ending on and including date in which Effective Time occurs and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Tax Period.

(c) To the extent the actual amount of a Non-Income Tax is not known at the
time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Non-Income Tax pursuant
to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the
most recent information available in estimating the amount of such Non-Income
Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of a Pre-
Effective Time Non-Income Tax liability is ultimately determined to be less
than the amount that was taken into account as a Working Capital Liability as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4, timely payments shall be made from
Purchaser to Seller in an amount equal to such difference; and, to the extent
the actual amount of benefit realized from a prepaid Post-Effective Time Non-
Income Tax (including any carryforward, refund, credit or other Tax benefit
relating thereto) is ultimately determined to be less than the amount that was
taken into account as a Working Capital Asset as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.4, timely payments shall be made from Seller to Purchaser in an
amount equal to such difference.

Section 11.5 Tax Cooperation and Contests.

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the Other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, claim, litigation, or similar proceeding (each a "Tax Proceeding")
with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or
activities of any member of the Company Group. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the Other Party's request) the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

(b) If any Tax Proceeding in respect of which Seller would be required to
indemnify Purchaser under Section 13.2 is asserted or initiated in writing
against Purchaser or any member of the Company Group, Purchaser or the Company
Group shall promptly notify Seller of such Tax Proceeding in writing after
receipt thereof, and shall give Seller such information with respect thereto
as Seller may reasonably request; provided that the failure of Purchaser to
give notice thereof shall not relieve Seller of its obligations to indemnify
Purchaser under Section 13.2, except to the extent that such failure
materially and adversely prejudiced Seller. Seller shall have the right to
participate in and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section
11.5(b), shall be entitled to, at its own expense, control and appoint lead
counsel reasonably acceptable to Purchaser for the defense of any Tax
Proceeding that relates solely to Taxes in respect of which Seller would be
required to indemnify Purchaser under Section 13.2; provided that, (i) prior
to assuming control of such defense, Seller must acknowledge that it would
have an indemnity obligation under Section 13.2 for Taxes and Damages
resulting from such Tax Proceeding and (i) Seller shall not settle such a Tax
Proceeding without Purchaser's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Seller assumes control of
such defense, Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed regarding the
status of such Tax Proceeding and Purchaser shall have the right





(but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Seller.
Purchaser shall control any Tax Proceeding that relates in part, but not
solely, to Taxes in respect of which Seller would be required to indemnify
Purchaser under Section 13.2; provided that Seller shall have the right, at
its own expense, to participate in the conduct of such a Tax Proceeding and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
Purchaser, Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding the
status of such Tax Proceeding, and Purchaser shall not settle such a Tax
Proceeding without Seller's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, this Section 11.5(b) shall govern the control
and conduct of any Tax Proceeding described hereunder and the provisions in
Section 13.5 shall not apply.

Section 11.6 Amended Returns. No amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-
Closing Income Tax Period, Pre-Effective Time Non-Income Tax Period or
Straddle Tax Period shall be filed by or on behalf of any member of the
Company Group without the consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 11.7 Tax Refunds. The amount of any refunds of Income Taxes of the
Company Group for any Pre-Closing Income Tax Period and Non-Income Taxes of
the Company Group for any Pre-Effective Time Non-Income Tax Period shall be
for the account of Seller. The amount of any refunds of Income Taxes of the
Company Group for any Post-Closing Tax Period and Non-Income Taxes of the
Company Group for any Post-Effective Time Non-Income Tax Period shall be for
the account of Purchaser or the Company Group. The amount of any refund of
Taxes of the Company Group for any Straddle Tax Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Purchaser (or the Company Group) and Seller in accordance
with the principles set forth in Section 11.3 and Section 11.4, as applicable.
Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the
Party entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this Section 11.7 the
amount of such refund within 30 days after such refund is received, net of any
reasonable third-party costs or expenses incurred by such Party or its
Affiliates in procuring such refund.

Section 11.8 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax Sharing
Agreements binding upon any member of the Company Group (other than a Tax
Sharing Agreement solely between or among members of the Company Group) shall
be terminated as of, or prior to, the Closing Date. After such date, none of
the members of the Company Group, Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective representatives shall have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.

Section 11.9 Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties intend and agree that the
purchase and sale of the Acquired Companies pursuant hereto shall be treated,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as Purchaser (i) acquiring the assets,
and assuming the liabilities, of Drum I Management and Drum I from the sole
member of Series I Seller, (ii) acquiring the assets, and the assuming the
liabilities, of Drum II Management and Drum II from the sole member of Series
II Seller, and (iii) acquiring the assets, and assuming the liabilities, of
Drum III Management and Drum III from the sole member of Series III Seller.

Section 11.10 Section 754 Election. To the extent any member of the Company
Group holds an interest in an entity or arrangement that is treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income





tax purposes, prior to the Closing, Seller and members of the Company Group
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such partnership (for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) to have in effect a valid election under
Section 754 of the Code and any comparable provision under applicable state or
local Law (a "Section 754 Election") for the taxable year during which the
Closing occurs and to provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser with
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that a Section 754 Election is
in effect with respect to such partnership (for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) as of the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 12 
TERMINATION

Section 12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing (the date of any permitted termination of this Agreement under
this Section 12.1, the "Termination Date"):

(a) by the mutual consent of Seller and Purchaser; or

(b) by Purchaser, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of a Drum Entity or Seller set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause any condition set
forth in Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b) not to be satisfied and such
condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date or, if curable, is
not cured by the Drum Entity or Seller within 30 days of receipt by Seller of
written notice of such breach or failure; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.1(b)
if Purchaser's breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder causes any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 9.1 not to be satisfied; or

(c) by Seller, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b) not to be satisfied and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured by
Purchaser within 30 days of receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such
breach or failure; provided, however, that Seller shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.1(c) if Seller's breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder causes
any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 9.2 not to be satisfied.

(d) by either Seller or Purchaser upon written notice to the Other Party, if

(i) Closing has not occurred on or before November 3, 2018 (the "End Date");
provided, however, that either Seller or Purchaser may extend the End Date to
a date that is not later than 90 days after November 3, 2018 if there is a
Requested CFIUS Filing and, prior to the End Date, all of the conditions to
the Other Party's obligation to consummate the Closing set forth in Article 9
have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than
those conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only at the Closing and
the conditions set forth in Section 9.1(c) or Section 9.1(d), in the case of
an extension by Purchaser, or Section 9.2(c) or Section 9.2(d), in the case of
an extension by





Seller, in each case solely to the extent related to CFIUS Approval);
provided, further, that neither Seller nor Purchaser may extend the End Date
pursuant to this Section 12.1(d)(i) if it is in breach of this Agreement and
such breach has primarily resulted in the failure of the Closing to have been
consummated prior to the End Date; or

(ii) an injunction, order, or award restraining, enjoining, or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;

provided, however, no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
under Section 12.1(d) if the Closing has failed to occur, or if an injunction,
order, or award restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has become
final and nonappealable, primarily as a result of such Party's failure to
perform or observe in any material respect such Party's representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements hereunder (including the failure to
perform the obligations of such Party with respect to the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereunder if and when required).

Section 12.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 12.1, this Agreement
shall become void and of no further force or effect (except for the provisions
of Article 1, Section 6.9, Article 7, Section 8.1, Section 8.2(c), Section
8.2(d), Section 8.2(e), Section 8.7, Article 12, and Article 14, all of which
shall survive and continue in full force and effect indefinitely). The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

(b) Subject to Section 12.2(d), in the event that (i) all conditions precedent
to the obligations of Seller set forth in Section 9.1 have been satisfied or
waived in writing by Seller (or would have been satisfied except for the
breach or failure of any of Seller's representations, warranties, or covenants
hereunder) and (i) the Closing has not occurred solely as a result of the
material breach or material failure of Seller's representations, warranties,
or covenants hereunder, including, if and when required, Seller's obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at the Closing, then
Purchaser shall be entitled to promptly elect in writing, as the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Group against any member of the Seller Group
for such breach, to (A) enforce and cause the specific performance of this
Agreement as permitted by Section 14.2, or (A) terminate this Agreement and
receive a reimbursement of Purchaser's direct, documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with negotiation and execution of this
Agreement for the sole account and use of Purchaser.

(c) Subject to Section 12.2(e), in the event that (i) all conditions precedent
to the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Section 9.2 have been satisfied
or waived in writing by Purchaser (or would have been satisfied except for the
breach or failure of any of Purchaser's representations, warranties or
covenants hereunder) and (i) the Closing has not occurred solely as a result
of the breach or failure of any of Purchaser's representations, warranties, or
covenants hereunder, including, if and when required, Purchaser's obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at the Closing, then
Seller shall be entitled to promptly elect in writing, as





the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Group against any member of the
Purchaser Group for such breach to either (A) enforce and cause the specific
performance of this Agreement as permitted by Section 14.2, or (A) terminate
this Agreement and receive a reimbursement of Seller's direct, documented out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with negotiation and execution of
this Agreement for the sole account and use of Seller.

(d) In the event that Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1 (and Purchaser is not then in material breach of this Agreement) and such
right of Purchaser to terminate this Agreement arose due the Willful and
Material Breach or Fraud of Seller, then in addition to the other remedies
provided in this Section 12.2, Purchaser shall be entitled to pursue a claim
against Seller for Damages.

(e) In the event that Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1 (and Seller is not then in material breach of this Agreement) and such
right of Seller to terminate this Agreement arose due the Willful and Material
Breach or Fraud of Purchaser, then in addition to the other remedies provided
in this Section 12.2, Seller shall be entitled to pursue a claim against
Purchaser for Damages.

ARTICLE 13 
INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATIONS

Section 13.1 Seller's Indemnification Rights. Subject to the terms hereof,

EVEN IF ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT),
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, INVITEES OR
THIRD PARTIES, but excluding any Damages against which Seller is entitled to
indemnification or defense from Purchaser under Section 13.1 at the time the
applicable Claim Notice is presented by Seller.

indemnification or defense from Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, except in
each case as to matters for which a specific written Claim Notice has been

or the date otherwise required to be delivered hereunder.

(c) Subject to Section 14.13 and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement, except in respect of claims of Fraud,

relating to or arising out of any individual event, matter, or occurrence for
which a Claim Notice is delivered by Purchaser and for Seller(s) admits (or it
is otherwise finally determined) that Purchaser is entitled to indemnification
or defense from Seller pursuant to Section 13.2(b) with respect to the Seller

amount of such Damages exceeds the Individual Threshold (it being agreed that
the Individual Threshold represents a threshold and not a deductible); and (A)
for any and all Damages that exceed the Individual Threshold, unless and until
the aggregate amount of the sum of (x) all such Damages with respect to all
Seller Non-Fundamental Representations and under Section 13.2(e) and (y) any
Defect Amounts, collectively, exceeds 2% of Unadjusted Purchase Price (in
which case Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification for all such

the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, except in respect of
claims of Fraud, Seller shall not be entitled to indemnity from Purchaser: (i)
for any and all Damages relating to or arising out of any individual event,
matter, or occurrence for which a Claim Notice is delivered by Seller and for
Purchaser admits (or it is otherwise finally determined) that Seller is
entitled to indemnification or defense from Purchaser pursuant to Section
13.1(b) with respect to the Purchaser Non-Fundamental Representations (A)
unless and until the amount of such Damages exceeds the Individual Threshold
(it being agreed that the Individual Threshold represents a threshold and not
a deductible), and (A) for any and all Damages that exceed the Individual
Threshold, unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Damages with
respect to all Purchaser Non-Fundamental Representations exceeds 2% of
Unadjusted Purchase Price (in which case Seller shall be entitled to
indemnification for all such Damages); (i) for cumulative aggregate Damages
(after giving effect to Section 13.3(d)(i)(A) and Section 13.3(d)(i)(B) to
satisfy the Purchaser Capped Indemnification Obligations, in excess of an
amount equal to 10% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and (i) for any and all
Damages under this Agreement in excess of the consideration actually paid by
Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in
Article 12 and in the case of Fraud, after Closing, (i) the payment of money,
as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained
herein or for any other claim arising in connection with or with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (i) Purchaser and Seller
hereby waive any and all rights to rescind, reform, cancel, terminate, revoke,
or void this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, each Party shall have the non-exclusive right to specific
performance and other equitable remedies available at law or equity (including
injunctive relief) for the breach or failure of any Other Party to perform its
obligations hereunder required to be performed after Closing.

(f) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser for any Post-Effective

representation or warranty set forth in Section 5.11 (other than the
representation or warranty set forth in Section 5.11(g) and Section 5.11(h)).

(g) For purposes of determining (i) the existence of any inaccuracy,
misrepresentation, failure or breach of any representation or warranty and (i)
the amount of any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder with respect to
such inaccuracies, misrepresentations, failures or breaches, the applicable
representations and warranties (except in the case of Section 5.8(a) and
Section 6.16(a)) will be read without regard and without giving effect to any
materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect or similar standard or qualification contained therein; provided, that
this sentence shall not apply (A) with respect to any materiality





qualifier that qualifies an affirmative requirement to list specified items on
the Schedules (as opposed to a disclosure against a representation and
warranty), nor (A) be deemed to turn references to "Material Contract" to
"Contract" or "Material Contracts" to "Contracts".

(h) Seller waives any right of contribution, right of indemnity or advancement
of expenses or other right or remedy Seller may have under any agreement to
which Seller is a party as of the Closing, against the Purchaser, the Company
Group or their respective Affiliates, in each case with respect to any
indemnification obligation that Seller may have to Purchaser under this
Agreement; provided, however, this Section 13.3(h) shall in no way affect any
rights of (x) Seller under any Transaction Documents or (y) the Company Group
Indemnified Parties.

Section 13.4 Exclusive Remedy and Certain Limitations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, except in respect of claims of Fraud, Purchaser agrees and
shall cause each member of the Purchaser Group to agree that Purchaser's and
Purchaser Group's sole and exclusive remedy against any member of the Seller
Group with respect to the negotiation, performance, and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder and any breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of any member of the Seller Group
contained herein or in the Seller Certificate are (i) the rights to
indemnification or defense from Seller set forth in Section 13.2, as limited
by the terms of this Article 13, (i) the right to specific performance
permitted by Section 14.2, (i) Purchaser's rights under Section 8.22, (i) the
rights to the adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.5 and (i) the remedies under the other Transaction Documents (the "Retained
Claims"). Except for the Retained Claims, Purchaser waives, releases, remises,
and forever discharges, and shall cause each member of the Purchaser Group to
waive, release, remise, and forever discharge, each member of the Seller Group
from any and all Damages, suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims,
demands, losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, interest, charges, or causes
of action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which any member
of the Purchaser Group might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating
to or arising out of the negotiation, performance, and consummation of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, or the condition,
quality, status or nature of any Assets, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION
UNDER CERCLA OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, BREACHES OF STATUTORY AND IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS, RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES, COMMON
LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, ANY RIGHTS UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED OR
UNDERWRITTEN BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP, AND ANY RIGHTS UNDER
AGREEMENTS AMONG ANY MEMBERS OF THE SELLER GROUP EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN
PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
COMPARATIVE, OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
RELEASED PERSON, INVITEES OR THIRD PARTIES. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, from and after Closing, except in
respect of claims of Fraud, Seller agrees and shall cause each member of the
Seller Group to agree that Seller's and Seller Group's sole and exclusive
remedy against any member of the Purchaser Group with respect to the
negotiation, performance, and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and any breach of the representations,





warranties, covenants and agreements of any member of the Seller Group
contained herein or in the Seller Certificate are (A) the rights to
indemnification or defense from Seller set forth in Section 13.2, as limited
by the terms of this Article 13, (A) the right to specific performance
permitted by Section 14.2 and (A) the rights to the adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5. Except in respect of claims
of Fraud, the Parties have agreed that should any representation or warranty
of any Party prove inaccurate, incomplete or untrue, the Other Party shall
only have the specific rights and remedies herein specified as the exclusive
remedy therefor, that no other rights, remedies, or causes of action (whether
in law or in equity or whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) are
permitted to any Party as a result of the failure, breach, inaccuracy,
incompleteness, or untruthfulness of any such representation and warranty.

(b) Any claim for indemnity under this Article 13 by any current or former
Affiliate, stockholder, member, officer, director, employee, agent, lender,
advisor, representative, accountant, attorney, and consultant of any Party
must be brought and administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No
Indemnified Person other than Seller and Purchaser shall have any rights
against Seller, Purchaser or any of the Company Group under the terms of this
Article 13, except as may be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or Seller,
as applicable, pursuant to this Article 13. Seller and Purchaser may elect to
exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Agreement on behalf
of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and
shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or
inaction under this Section 13.4.

(c) Each Indemnified Person shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate or minimize all Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that
are indemnifiable hereunder. The amount of any Damages for which an
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Article 13 shall be
reduced by the amount of insurance or other Third Party proceeds, recoupment,
reimbursements, or claims actually realized by Purchaser or applicable members
of the Purchaser Group (including the Company Group) or Seller or the
applicable members of the Seller Group, as applicable. In the event that any
member of the Purchaser Group or Seller Group receives funds or proceeds from
any insurance carrier or any other Third Party with respect to any Damages,
Purchaser (in the case of Purchaser Group) and Seller (in the case of Seller
Group) shall, regardless of when received by such member of the Purchaser
Group or Seller Group, as applicable, promptly pay and reimburse Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, such funds or proceeds to the extent of any funds
previously paid to or received by any member of the Purchaser Group or Seller
Group, as applicable, respect to such Damages.

(d) The Parties shall treat, for U.S. federal, state and local income and
applicable federal, state, local and non-U.S. Tax purposes, any amounts paid
or received under this Article 13 as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Laws.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances shall any Party be entitled to double recovery under
this Agreement, and to the extent a Party is compensated for a matter through
an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or third-party recovery or
insurance recovery actually received, such Party shall not have a separate
right to indemnification hereunder for such matter.





(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of each member
of the Purchaser Group to indemnification (and Seller's obligations) under
Section 13.2 (as limited by the terms hereof) shall be satisfied first (i)
from the Holdback Amount (rounded up to the nearest number of whole shares)
until there are no shares of Parent Common Equity remaining therein, second
(i) by Seller, who shall surrender to Purchaser for cancellation an aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Equity (rounded up to the nearest number of
whole shares) calculated by dividing (x) the amount of such payment by (y) the
Current Price, until Seller no longer owns any shares of Parent Common Equity
and third (i) by Seller, in cash.

Section 13.5 Indemnification Actions. All claims for indemnification under
Article 13 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 13, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used
in connection with particular Damages means (i) Seller in the event any member
of the Purchaser Group is entitled to indemnity under Section 13.2 and (i)
Purchaser in the event any member of the Seller Group is entitled to
indemnification under Section 13.1. For purposes of this Article 13, the term
"Indemnified Person" when used in connection with particular Damages means (x)
Purchaser in the event any member of the Purchaser Group is entitled to
indemnity under Section 13.2 and (y) Seller in the event any member of the
Seller Group is entitled to indemnification under Section 13.1.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification, defense or reimbursement under this
Article 13, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its
claim, including the specific details (including supporting documentation of
the alleged Damages and such Indemnified Person's good faith estimate of the
applicable claim) of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim
(the "Claim Notice").

(c) In the event that any claim for indemnification set forth in any Claim
Notice is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Person
(a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice
promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Third Party
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to
give notice of any Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 13.5 shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 13
except to the extent such failure shall have materially and adversely
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an alleged inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that was
allegedly inaccurate or breached.

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 13.5 shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Person for such defense, in each case at its own
expense; provided that prior to assuming control of such defense, the
Indemnifying Party must acknowledge that, based on the facts set forth in the
Claim Notice, it would have an indemnity obligation for the Damages resulting
from such Third Party Claim as provided under this Article 13.





(e) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control
of the defense of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver the acknowledgment and evidence referred to in Section 13.5(d) within
30 days of receipt of notice of the Claim Notice, (i) the Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (i) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Person or any of its
Affiliates, (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or otherwise involves a claim
by a Governmental Authority or a customer of the Company Group or (i) in the
case of any member of the Purchaser Group, the amount of the Third Party
Claim, if determined in accordance with the claimant's demands, would
reasonably be expected to result in any Damages, together with all other
unresolved claims for indemnification by any member of the Purchaser Group,
that would not be available for recovery under this Article 13.

(f) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.5, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim; provided
that consent of the Indemnified Person shall not be required for any such
settlement if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party and (i) such settlement includes an
unconditional release of the Purchaser Group or the Seller Group, as the case
may be, from all Liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Third
Party Claim and does not include any statement as to or any admission of
fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Purchaser Group or
the Seller Group, as the case may be. An Indemnified Person may not settle any
Third Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the
Indemnified Person may admit liability with respect to, or settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior
written consent so long as the Indemnified Person releases, to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Indemnifying Party, any claims to indemnification with
respect to such Third Party Claim pursuant to this Article 13.

(g) In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in which
case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnified Person; provided that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) to the extent incurred
by the Indemnified Person prior to the date that the Indemnifying Party
assumes control of the defense of the Third Party Claim or (i) if the
Indemnified Person is advised by counsel that (A) there is a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person in the
conduct of the defense of such claim or (A) there may be one or more defenses
or claims available to the Indemnified Person that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party and that could be
materially adverse to the Indemnifying Party. In the case of the foregoing
clause (ii), the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Person
reasonably informed with respect to such Third Party Claim and cooperate with
the Indemnified Person in connection therewith.





(h) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(i) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim (a "Direct Claim"), such Direct Claim shall be asserted by giving the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt Claim Notice thereof; provided that the
failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of any Third Party Claim as
provided in this Section 13.5 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Article 13 except to the extent such failure shall have
materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Such Claim Notice
by the Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all available material written evidence
thereof, and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of Damages that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Person. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
(i) cure the Damages complained of, (i) (x) in the case of Seller, admit
Purchaser's right to indemnity and reimbursement against Seller in respect of
such Direct Claim as provided in this Article 13 or (y) in the case of
Purchaser, admit Seller's right to indemnity and reimbursement against
Purchaser in respect of such Direct Claim as provided in this Article 13, as
applicable or (i) dispute the claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Person within such 30 day period that it
has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the
Indemnifying Party shall be conclusively deemed (x) in the case of Seller, to
have admitted Purchaser's right to indemnity and reimbursement right against
Seller in respect of such Direct Claim as provided in this Article 13 or (y)
in the case of Purchaser, to have admitted Seller's right to indemnity and
reimbursement right against Purchaser in respect of such Direct Claim as
provided in this Article 13, as applicable, and in each case, and the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to prompt payment of all Damages arising
out of such claim in accordance with this Article 13. If the Indemnifying
Party has timely disputed its indemnity obligation for any Damages with
respect to such Direct Claim, the Parties shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 14.4.

(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 13.5 shall
not apply to any Tax Proceeding and the control and conduct of any Tax
Proceeding shall be governed by Section 11.5(b).

Section 13.6 Holdback Amount.

(a) If at any time on or prior to the Second Holdback Deadline Purchaser
delivers to Seller a Claim Notice or Mechanical Integrity Notice, as
applicable, that Purchaser is entitled under Section 13.2 or Section 8.22, as

amount of shares of Parent Common Equity equal to the Dividend Adjustment.





(g) In the event that the Transfer Agent fails to remove the Contract Legend
within 10 Business Days of (x) delivery of the Transfer Agent Documentation by
Seller and Purchaser, as applicable, and (y) joint written instructions from
Purchaser and Seller with respect to the shares of Parent Common Equity to
which Seller is entitled under this Section 13.6 (the "Eligible Shares"),

amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Eligible Shares and
(y) the Current Price (on the date on which the Transfer Agent was required to
remove the Contract Legend pursuant to this Agreement) or (i) issue to Seller
additional shares equal to the number of Eligible Shares without any Contract
Legend. After Purchaser shall have satisfied its obligations under this

with the applicable Transfer Agent Documentation and (B) deliver the Transfer
Agent joint written instructions to transfer to Purchaser the applicable
Eligible Shares and remove the Restrictive Legends on such shares.

(h) The Current Price and the number of shares recoverable by the Purchaser

Section 14.2 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
rights of each Party hereunder are special, unique and of extraordinary
character, that irreparable damage would occur and the Parties would not have
any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
each case, in accordance with the terms hereof. Such remedies shall, however,
be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which any Party may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(a) either Party has an adequate remedy at Law or (a) an award of specific





performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Each
Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 14.2, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 14.2, from and after the Closing, this Section
14.2 shall only apply to the covenants and agreements of the Parties to be
performed after the Closing.

Section 14.3 Governing Laws. This Agreement and the documents delivered
pursuant hereto and the legal relations between the Parties shall be governed
by, construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas,
without regard to principles of conflicts of Laws that would direct the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction; provided, however, in
connection with the determination of the existence of any Defect or Title
Benefit or with respect to conveyancing matters as to any Oil and Gas
Property, the Laws of the state or commonwealth where such Oil and Gas
Property is located pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act shall
govern and control such determination.

Section 14.4 Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) Except as to any dispute, controversy, matters, or claim arising out of or
in relation to or in connection with the calculation or determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3, Section 2.4 or Section 2.5
(which shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 2.5(c)), the
Parties irrevocably agree that the courts of the State of Texas in and for
Harris County, Texas or the United States District Court located in Houston,
Texas shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute, controversy, matter,
or claim between the Parties (each, subject to such exceptions, a "Dispute").
The Parties irrevocably agree that with respect to a Dispute, venue is proper
in the courts of the State of Texas in and for Harris County, Texas, or the
United States District Court located in Houston, Texas and each Party hereby
irrevocably (i) agrees not to assert that the said venue is not proper or that
the forum selected hereby is not convenient or that some other forum is more
convenient, and (i) covenants not to commence litigation or other proceedings
on a Dispute except in accordance with this Section 14.4.

(b) To the extent that any Party or any of its Affiliates has or hereafter may
acquire immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its
property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with
respect to this Agreement and (i) submits to the personal jurisdiction of any
court described in Section 14.4(a). Further, each Party waives any objection
which it may have pertaining to improper venue or forum non-conveniens to the
conduct of any litigation or proceeding in the foregoing courts. Each Party
agrees that any and all process directed to it in any such proceeding or
litigation may be served upon it outside of the State of Texas in and for
Harris County, Texas or the United States District Court located in Houston
with the same force and effect as if such service had been made within the
State of Texas in and for Harris County, Texas or the United States District
Court located in Houston. The Parties agree that a dispute under this
Agreement may raise issues that are common with one or more of





the other Transaction Documents or other documents executed by the Parties in
connection herewith or which are substantially the same or interdependent and
interrelated or connected with issues raised in a related dispute,
controversy, or claim between or among the Parties and their Affiliates.
Accordingly, any Party to a new Dispute under this Agreement may elect in
writing within 15 days after the initiation of a new Dispute to refer such new
Dispute for resolution by the applicable court together with any existing
Dispute arising under this Agreement, other Transaction Documents or other
documents executed by the Parties in connection herewith or which are
substantially the same or interdependent and interrelated or connected. If the
applicable court does not determine to consolidate such new Dispute with the
existing Dispute within 30 days of receipt of written request, then the new
Dispute shall not be consolidated, and the resolution of the new Dispute shall
proceed separately.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 14.5 Headings and Construction. The headings and captions herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to govern,
limit, or aid in the construction of any term or provision hereof. The rights
and obligations of each Party shall be determined pursuant to this Agreement.
Each Party has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation
to the negotiation of the details and terms of the transaction contemplated
hereby. This Agreement is the result of arm's length negotiations from equal
bargaining positions. It is the intention of the Parties that every covenant,
term, and provision of this Agreement shall be construed simply according to
its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any Party (notwithstanding
any rule of law requiring an agreement to be strictly construed against the
drafting Party) and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on
the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision thereof,
it being understood that the Parties to this Agreement are sophisticated and
have had adequate opportunity and means to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated
hereby and retain counsel to represent their interests and to otherwise
negotiate the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 14.6 Waivers. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements, or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by the application of the express terms
hereof by an instrument signed by the Party to whom compliance is owed and
expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No course of
dealing on the part of any Party or its respective officers, employees,
agents, or representatives and no failure by any Party to exercise any of its
rights under this Agreement shall, in each case, operate as a waiver thereof
or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to enforce the
performance of such provision. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
no waiver of, or consent to a change in or modification of, any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of,
or consent to a change in or modification of, other provisions hereof (whether
or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided herein. The rights of each Party under this
Agreement shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial exercise of any such
right shall not preclude the exercise by such Party of





any other right. No consent under this Agreement shall be valid unless set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

Section 14.7 Severability. It is the intent of the Parties that the provisions
contained in this Agreement shall be severable and should any terms or
provisions, in whole or in part, be held invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced as a matter of law, such holding shall not affect the other
portions of this Agreement, and such portions that are not invalid shall be
given effect without the invalid portion. Upon such determination that any
term or provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

Section 14.8 Assignment. No Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all or
any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights or
duties hereunder, without the consent of the Purchaser and Seller and any
transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be null and void;
except that Purchaser may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under
this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (a) one or more of
its Affiliates at any time or (a) after the Closing, any Person; provided,
however, that any such assignment by Purchaser shall in no event relieve
Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement and Purchaser and
such assignees shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of
Purchaser hereunder; provided, further, that Purchaser shall not assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate that is an entity
organized or incorporated under the Laws of (or, in the case of an Affiliate
that is a partnership under relevant state Law, having its principal place of
business in) the State of Texas unless Purchaser agrees to be responsible for
and indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any
Taxes resulting from such an assignment by Purchaser (or any of its successors
and assigns). Unless expressly agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller,
no permitted assignment of any Party's rights or duties that is subject to the
consent of the Purchaser and Seller shall relieve or release the assigning
Party from the performance of such Party's rights or obligations hereunder and
such assigning Party shall be fully liable for the performance of all such
rights and duties. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

Section 14.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to
the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY
SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
GOVERN AND CONTROL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE
SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
Section 14.9.





Section 14.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by Seller and Purchaser and expressly identified
as an amendment or modification.

Section 14.11 Seller Release. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, its
controlled Affiliates (other than the Company Group) and its respective
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasing Parties"), forever
waives, releases, remises and discharges Purchaser (and its direct and
indirect equityholders), the Company Group, their respective predecessors,
successors and Affiliates and, in their capacities as such, the directors,
officers, employees, consultants, attorneys, agents, assigns and employee
benefit plans of the foregoing (collectively, the "Released Parties") from any
Action or Liability that the Releasing Parties may currently have, or may have
in the future, against the Company Group, Purchaser or their respective
Affiliates (i) arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date (so long as the
facts, circumstances, actions, omissions and/or events giving rise to such
claim or Liability (x) occurred on or prior to the Closing or (y) occurred
after the Closing but were a continuation of, facts, circumstances, actions,
omissions and/or events that occurred on or prior to the Closing), in any case
solely relating to the Company Group or direct or indirect ownership of the
Releasing Party therein or (ii) relating to the approval or consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any Transaction Document, including
any alleged breach of any duty by any officer, manager, director, equityholder
or other owner of ownership interests of Seller, any member of the Company
Group or any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Released
Claims"), except for the Releasing Parties' rights hereunder; provided,
however, the "Released Claims" shall not include any Action or Liability
relating to the Excluded Arrangements. Seller (i) represents that neither it
nor its controlled Affiliates has assigned or transferred or purported to
assign or transfer to any Person all or any part of, or any interest in, any
Action or Liability of any nature, character or description whatsoever, which
is or which purports to be released or discharged by this Section 14.11, (ii)
acknowledges that the Releasing Parties may hereafter discover facts other
than or different from those that they know or believe to be true with respect
to the subject matter of the Released Claims, but it hereby expressly agrees
that, on and as of the Closing, the Releasing Parties shall have waived
Released Claims in accordance with this Section 14.11, without regard to the
subsequent discovery or existence of such different or additional facts and
(iii) acknowledges that in connection with any claim or demand or Action
brought against the Released Party by a Releasing Party with respect to any
Released Claim, the applicable Released Party may recover from the Releasing
Parties all costs incurred in connection with such Action, including
attorneys' fees, if and to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that it is a Released Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Support Agreement, this Section 14.11 in no way shall affect
any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including each member of the
Seller Group) under this Agreement or the rights of any Company Group
Indemnified Party under the Governing Documents of the Company Group.

Section 14.12 No Third-Person Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall
entitle any Person other than a Party to any claim, cause of action, remedy,
or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided to the Persons
described in Section 8.2, Section 8.17, Article 13 and/or Section 14.16, in
each case, only to the extent such rights are exercised or pursued, if at all,
by Seller or Purchaser acting on behalf of such Person (which rights may be
exercised in the sole discretion of the applicable Party hereunder).
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the Parties reserve the right





to amend, modify, terminate, supplement, or waive any provision of this
Agreement or this entire Agreement without the consent or approval of any
other Person (including any Indemnified Person) and (a) no Party hereunder
shall have any direct liability to any permitted Third Party beneficiary, nor
shall any permitted Third Party beneficiary have any right to exercise any
rights hereunder for such Third Party beneficiary's benefit except to the
extent such rights are brought, exercised, and administered by a Party hereto
in accordance with Section 13.4(b) or by a Non-Recourse Person in connection
with the enforcement of Section 14.16.

Section 14.13 Limitation on Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
CONTAINED HEREIN, NO PERSON SHALL BE ENTITLED TO LOST PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN
VALUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND EACH OF PURCHASER AND SELLER, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS OF THE PURCHASER GROUP AND SELLER GROUP,
RESPECTIVELY, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO LOST PROFITS, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OTHER THAN (I) ANY SUCH DAMAGES OWED
OR PAYABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY AND (II) ANY SUCH LOST PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN
VALUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL
DAMAGES THAT ARE THE NATURAL, PROBABLE AND REASONABLE RESULT OF THE EVENT(S)
OR MATTER(S) FOR WHICH INDEMNIFICATION OR DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT HEREUNDER.

Section 14.14 Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Purchaser covenants that if the
Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act, Subchapter E of
Chapter 17, Sections 17.41, et seq., of the Texas Business and Commerce Code,
(the "DTPA") or the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection
Law, LA. R.S. 51:1402, et seq. (the "UTPCPL") is applicable to this Agreement,
AFTER CONSULTATION WITH ATTORNEYS OF PURCHASER'S OWN SELECTION, PURCHASER
HEREBY VOLUNTARILY WAIVES AND RELEASES ALL OF PURCHASER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES
UNDER THE DTPA AND UTPCPL, AS APPLICABLE, TO SELLER AND SELLER'S SUCCESSORS
AND ASSIGNS, AND PURCHASER SHALL DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY THE SELLER GROUP FROM
AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OF OR BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP OR
ANY OF THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR AFFILIATES BASED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART ON THE DTPA AND THE UTPCPL, AS APPLICABLE, ARISING OUT OF OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 14.15 Time of the Essence; Calculation of Time. Time is of the essence
in this Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any
notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during
which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date
that is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking
such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is
required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day that is a Business
Day.





Section 14.16 Non-Recourse Persons. The Parties acknowledge and agree, except
in the case of Fraud of the applicable Non-Recourse Person, that (i) no past,
present, or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, agent, attorney, representative, Affiliate, or financing
source (including, without limitation, First Reserve Corporation, First
Reserve Management, L.P., any investment fund managed by First Reserve
Corporation, First Reserve Management, L.P. or any of their respective
Affiliates), and any of the foregoing Person's respective past, present, or
future directors, managers, officers, employees, incorporators, members,
partners, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives, Affiliates, or
financing sources, of Seller (excluding, in each case, any of Seller or,
solely for purposes of Section 8.1 and Section 14.2, any member of the Company
Group, each, subject to such exclusion, a "Non-Recourse Person"), in such
capacity, shall have any liability or responsibility (in contract, tort, or
otherwise) for, and (ii) Purchaser hereby waives, releases, remises and
forever discharges, and shall cause each member of the Purchaser Group to
waive, release, remise and forever discharge, any Damages, suits, legal or
administrative proceedings, claims, demands, losses, costs, obligations,
liabilities, interests, charges, or causes of action whatsoever, in law or in
equity, known or unknown, against each Non-Recourse Person which are based on,
related to, or arise out of or under this Agreement or the negotiation,
performance, and consummation of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder. Each Non-
Recourse Person is expressly intended as a third-party beneficiary of this
Section 14.16.

Section 14.17 Certain Waivers. Purchaser and the Drum Entities agree, on their
own behalf and on behalf of the other Purchaser Group (including the Acquired
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries following Closing), that,
following the Closing, Vinson and Elkins LLP and/or Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP
(collectively, "Seller Counsel") may serve as counsel to Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding any representation by Seller Counsel of any Drum Entity prior
to the Closing. Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the other members of the
Purchaser Group (including each member of the Company Group after the Closing)
hereby (a) consents to Seller Counsel's representation of Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) waives any claim it has or may have that
Seller Counsel has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representation based on its representation of the Company
Group prior to the Closing and (a) agrees that, in the event that a dispute
arises between Purchaser, Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Seller and/or its Affiliates, on the other hand, none of
Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates will object
to Seller Counsel representing Seller and/or its Affiliates in such dispute
due to the interests of Seller and its Affiliates being directly adverse to
Purchaser, Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates or due to
Seller Counsel having represented any member of the Company Group in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Purchaser further agrees that, as to
all communications among Seller Counsel, the Company Group, Seller or their
respective Affiliates and representatives prior to the Closing that relate in
any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the
attorney-client privilege belongs, to the extent such privilege exists, to
Seller and its Affiliates and may be controlled by Seller and each of their
respective Affiliates and will not, with respect to such privileged
communications, pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, Company Group, or any of





their respective Affiliates. To the extent that Purchaser, Company Group, or
any of their respective Affiliates has or maintains any ownership of the
privilege with respect to these communications, they agree, except as may be
required by applicable Law, not to waive or to attempt to waive the privilege
without the express written approval of Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser or any of the Acquired
Companies and a Third Party (other than Seller and its Affiliates) or any
Governmental Authority after the Closing, each member of the Company Group may
assert the attorney-client privilege against such Third Party to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by or with Seller Counsel.

Section 14.18 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile, .pdf or
other electronic transmission of copies of signatures shall constitute
original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement and any enforcement
hereof.

Article 2 
REGISTRATION

Section 2.01. Shelf Registration Statement. Prior to the expiration of the
Lock-up Period, the Company shall have filed with the SEC a Shelf Registration
Statement (the "Registration Statement") (which shall be an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) if the Company is then eligible to file such a registration
statement) registering for resale all Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by the
Holders and set forth in the Registration Statement, and, if applicable, shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective under the Securities Act prior to the expiration of the Lock-up
Period. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act in
order to permit the Prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by the
Holders until termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall, to the extent not included
in the Registration Statement, from time to time as required to enable the
resale of Registrable Securities by all Holders, file a Prospectus supplement
naming each such Holder (subject to receipt of information reasonably
requested by the Company necessary to complete such Prospectus supplement).
The Registration Statement when declared effective (including the documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply in all material respects as to
form with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

(a) If the continued use of the Shelf Registration Statement at any time would
require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon
written notice of such action to the Holders, suspend use of the Registration
Statement (an "Unusual Shelf Suspension"). The Company shall not exercise its
right hereunder to an Unusual Shelf Suspension on more than two occasions, or
in aggregate more than sixty days, in any twelve-month period. In addition,
the Company may, upon giving written notice to the Holders, suspend the use of
the Registration Statement during regular quarterly periods beginning on the
first day after the end of the quarter



 and ending on the day following the date that the Company releases earnings in
respect of the previous calendar quarter (a "Regular Shelf Suspension,"
together with an Unusual Shelf Suspension, a "Shelf Suspension"). In the case
of a Shelf Suspension, the Holders shall suspend use of the applicable
Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or
purchase, any Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to
above. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders upon the termination
of any Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so
it does not contain any untrue statement or omission and furnish to the
Holders, such number of copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented
as the Holders may reasonably request. The Company shall, if necessary,
supplement or make amendments to the Registration Statement, if required by
the registration form used by the Company for the shelf registration or by the
instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act.

Section 2.02. Obligations of the Company.

(a) In connection with any Sale of Registrable Securities the Company will
cooperate with the applicable Holder to (i) if such Sale will result in such
Registrable Securities no longer being Registrable Securities, rescind the
Transfer Legend (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or any other Securities
Act transfer restrictions or notations applicable to the Registrable
Securities and, if the Registrable Securities are certificated, facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable
Securities to be Sold and not bearing any restrictive Securities Act legends
(and cover the costs of removing such legend) and (ii) register such
Registrable Securities in such denominations and such names as such Holder may
request, in each case within two Business following any request by the selling
Holder; provided that the Company may satisfy its obligations hereunder
without issuing physical stock certificates through the use of the Depository
Trust Company's Direct Registration System. In addition, and so long as the
applicable Holder is not an Affiliate of the Company in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Holder of national standing (including Vinson and Elkins LLP),
the Company shall take or cause to be taken such actions as are reasonably
necessary in order to cause any Securities Act legend, notation or similar
designation restricting transferability of the Registrable Securities held by
such Holder to be removed and to rescind any Securities Act transfer
restrictions or notations applicable to the Registrable Securities effective
as of the date that is one year following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing herein shall require the Company to remove the Contract
Legend placed on the Parent Common Equity constituting the Holdback Amount
(each as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or facilitate the transfer of such
shares prior to the time such legend is entitled to be removed pursuant to the
terms of the Purchase Agreement.

(b) None of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to
facilitate or participate in any underwritten offering, prepare any Prospectus
supplement (other than a Prospectus supplement to an existing shelf
registration statement to name the Holders as selling shareholders),
participate in any due diligence, execute any agreements or certificates or
deliver legal opinions or obtain comfort letters in respect of the Registrable
Securities or any Sale thereof.

(c) With a view to making available to the Holders of Registrable Securities
the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and other rules
and regulations of the SEC that



 may at any time permit a Holder of Registrable Securities to sell securities
of the Company to the public without registration, the Company will (i) use
its commercially reasonable efforts to file in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder, (ii) make and
keep available information necessary to comply with Rule 144 at all times, all
to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any other
rules or regulations now existing or hereafter adopted by the SEC and (iii) so
long as a Seller owns any Parent Common Equity, furnish (A) to the extent
accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of the Company that it
has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities
Act and (B) unless otherwise available via the SEC's EDGAR filing system, to
such Seller forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed
as such Seller may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or
regulation of the SEC allowing such Seller to sell any such securities without
registration.

(d) Should a Holder Transfer any Registrable Securities owned by it (i)
pursuant to a bona-fide gift, (ii) an Affiliate of the Holder, or (iii)
pursuant to a distribution for no consideration to a direct or indirect owner
of such Holder then, upon request by such Holder, the Company shall promptly
prepare and file with the SEC a Prospectus supplement, if necessary, to
accommodate the sale of Registrable Securities under the Registration
Statement by any recipient of Registrable Securities pursuant to clause
(i)-(iii) above (any such transfer described in (i)-(iii) above, a "Permitted
Transfer"), and any such recipient shall, upon its agreement in writing to be
bound as a Holder by the provisions of this Agreement, thereafter be deemed to
be a "Holder" for all purposes of this Agreement. In connection with any
Permitted Transfer, the Company will cooperate with the applicable Holder to
register with the Company's Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Parent Common
Equity the applicable shares of Parent Common Equity in such denominations and
such names as the Transferring Holder may request within two Business Days of
such request.

Section 2.03. Obligations of the Holders. As a condition precedent to the
inclusion of any Registrable Securities in any Shelf Registration, the Company
may require each Holder to furnish such information regarding the distribution
of such securities and such other information relating to such Holder, its
ownership of Registrable Securities and other matters as the Company may from
time to time reasonably request in writing. Each such Holder agrees to furnish
such information and to cooperate as reasonably necessary to enable the
Company to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. If a Holder fails to
promptly provide the requested information after prior written notice of such
request and the requested information is required by applicable law to be
included in the Registration Statement, the Company shall be entitled to
refuse to include for registration such Holder's Registrable Securities in the
Registration Statement.

(a) Each Holder shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the
Company, at any time when a Prospectus is required to be delivered (or deemed
delivered) under the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event, of which
such Holder has knowledge, relating to such Holder or its Sale of Registrable
Securities thereunder requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment
to such Prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered (or deemed delivered) to
the purchasers of such



 Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(b) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Securities, that,
upon receipt of any written notice from the Company of the occurrence of an
Unusual Shelf Suspension, such Holder will (i)(A) shall treat the notice as
confidential information, (B) shall not use any confidential information for
any purpose, (C) shall not trade while aware of such confidential information
unless and until such information shall become public or shall cease to be
material and (D) shall not disclose any such information to any Person;
provided, that any such Holder may disclose confidential information if such
disclosure is required by legal process, but such Holder shall cooperate with
the Company to limit the extent of such disclosure through protective order or
otherwise, and to seek confidential treatment of the information and (ii) will
cease any Transfers of Registrable Securities until such suspension has been
lifted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each
Holder shall be entitled by delivery of written notice to the Company (an
"Opt-Out Notice") to elect to forego its rights to resell any Registrable
Securities using the Registration Statement, and following the delivery of any
such Opt-Out Notice, until the applicable Holder delivers to the Company a
written notice electing to continue its use of the Registration Statement, (A)
such Holder shall cease the sale of any Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement and (B) the Company shall not deliver to such Holder
any notice of a Shelf Suspension pursuant to Section 2.01(b) or any other
material non-public information or other information that may restrict such
Holder from trading in securities of the Company.

(c) Each Holder agrees that it will not use any free writing prospectus (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in connection with any Transfer
of Registrable Securities other than one that has been provided by the Company
for use in connection therewith.

(d) Each Holder agrees that it will not (A) sell, contract to sell, pledge,
dispose of or otherwise transfer (including sales pursuant to Rule 144 or
Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code), directly or indirectly, any Parent
Common Equity issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, (B) enter into a
transaction which would have the same effect as described in clause (A) above,
(C) enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences or ownership of any Parent Common
Equity, whether such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such Parent
Common Equity, in cash or otherwise (each of (A), (B) and (C) above, a "Sale
Transaction"), or (D) publicly disclose the intention to enter into any Sale
Transaction, for 180 days following the Closing Date (the "Lock-up Period");
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.03(e) or otherwise shall
apply to or prohibit any Permitted Transfer by any Holder provided the
transferee in such Permitted Transfer agrees in writing to be bound be the
provision so this Section 2.03(e). The Company shall take all actions
necessary (including delivering the appropriate instructions, documentation
and opinions required by the Company's transfer agent) to cause the Lock-Up
Legend to be removed, on the date that is 180 days following the Closing Date,
from all shares of Parent Common Equity issued pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement (including any shares issued as part of the Holdback Amount (as
defined in the Purchase Agreement)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall require the Company to remove the Contract Legend placed on the
Parent Common Equity constituting the Holdback Amount (each



 as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or facilitate the transfer of such
shares prior to the time such legend is entitled to be removed pursuant to the
terms of the Purchase Agreement.

Section 2.04. Indemnification. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder that is a seller of Registrable Securities, and the
employees, officers, directors, partners, managers and members of each such
Holder, and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder within the meaning
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, from and against any Damages;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable for any Damages to the
extent that they arise out of or are based upon untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any such
Holder, controlling Person or other aforementioned Person expressly for use in
connection with such registration.

(a) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder that is a
seller of Registrable Securities is participating, each such Holder shall,
severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each
of its directors, officers and employees, each Person (if any) who controls
the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, any other Holder selling
securities in such registration statement and any controlling Person of any
such other Holder, from and against any Damages, in each case only to the
extent that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions
made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by
or on behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with the
Registration Statement; provided, however, that in no event shall the
aggregate amounts payable by any Holder by way of indemnity or contribution
under Section 2.04(b) and Section 2.04(d) exceed the proceeds from the
offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such
Holder).

(b) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.04 of
notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action)
for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
any indemnifying party under this Section 2.04, give the indemnifying party
prompt notice of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party, upon
request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the
indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and
disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In the event that
the indemnified party does not request appointment of counsel from the
indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate
in such action and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires,
participate jointly with any other indemnifying party to which notice has been
given, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to
the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all
other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one
counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees
and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if (i) the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of
such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party and representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by
the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party
represented by such counsel in such action. It



 is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any
proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to
local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees shall
be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing
by the applicable Holder in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant
to Section 2.04(b). The failure to give notice to the indemnifying party
within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve
such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this
Section 2.04, to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party's ability to defend such action. The failure to give notice
to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may
have to any indemnified party other than pursuant to this Section 2.04. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment.

(c) To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under
the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any party otherwise
entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 2.04 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of
a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the
expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that
such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the
fact that this Section 2.04 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii)
contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any party
hereto for which indemnification is provided under this Section 2.04, then,
and in each such case, such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which they may be subject (after
contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in
connection with the statements, omissions or other actions that resulted in
such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as well as to reflect any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue
statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a
material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission;
provided, however, that, in any such case (x) no Holder will be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such
Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such
Registration Statement and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation; and provided further that in no event shall a
Holder's liability pursuant to this Section 2.04(d), when combined with the
amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to Section 2.04(b), exceed the
proceeds from the offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling
Expenses paid by such Holder). The Company and Holders agree that it would not
be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article 2 were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take account of the considerations referred to in this Section
2.04(d).



 (d) The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.04 shall
survive the Transfer of securities.

Section 2.05. Registration Expenses. All Registration Expenses shall be borne
by the Company. All Selling Expenses shall be borne by the Holders pro-rata on
the basis of the number of Registrable Securities sold, or as otherwise agreed
by the Holders.

ARTICLE 3 
MISCELLANEOUS
