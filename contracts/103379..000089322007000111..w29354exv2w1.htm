ARTICLE 2 
 Purchase and Sale 

   

 Section 2.01 . _Purchase and Sale; Allocation of Purchase Price_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers agree to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase from the Sellers, the Company Shares and the Advances at the Closing. The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Company Shares and the Advances is $350,000,000. The Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.02 and shall be subject to net adjustment as provided in Sections 2.03 and 2.05. 

  

 (b) The Sellers and Buyer agree that Purchase Price (as adjusted) shall be allocated among the Company Shares and to the Advances as follows: (i) $1,000,000 to the outstanding shares of capital stock of VFG Dessous Vertriebs GmbH, (ii) $1,000,000 to the outstanding shares of capital stock of the French Company, (iii) $19,000,000 to the Advances and (iv) the balance to the outstanding shares of capital stock of Vanity Fair Ventures, Inc. The aggregate deemed sales price of the assets of Vanity Fair Ventures Inc. (as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4) shall be allocated among those assets (and among the assets of its U.S. Subsidiaries) in a manner consistent with the fair market values set forth in an allocation schedule (the "Allocation Statement") to be prepared by Buyer within 120 days of the Closing Date and approved by the Sellers. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on an allocation within 30 days of the preparation of the Allocation Statement, then the parties agree to be bound by an Allocation Statement prepared by independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Sellers (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or the Sellers) ("Independent Accountants"). The Sellers and Buyer agree that the Allocation Statement shall reflect the fair market value determinations set forth on Section 2.01(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. If an adjustment is made (or deemed to be made) with respect to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.05 or Section 8.07, the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect the net adjustment as mutually agreed by Buyer and the Sellers. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on an allocation within 30 days of an adjustment, then the parties agree to be bound by an adjustment prepared by Independent Accountants. Fees and other costs of the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other. The Sellers and Buyer agree to be bound by the Allocation Statement (as adjusted) for all purposes and to not take any position that is in any way inconsistent with the terms of the Allocation Statement (as adjusted) in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return or in any administrative or judicial proceeding. In the event any reported position based on the Allocation Statement is audited or disputed by any Governmental Authority, or otherwise, the party hereto receiving notice thereof shall promptly notify the other parties hereto. The Sellers and Buyer agree to 

   ##### 

  

    

cooperate in the defense of the reported positions of the parties based on the
Allocation Statement. 

  

 Section 2.02 . _Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Company Shares hereunder shall take place at (or be directed from) the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as practicable on a date to be mutually agreed by the parties, but in no event later than the date of VF Parents fiscal month end for the fiscal month during which all the conditions set forth in Article 10 are satisfied or (to the extent permitted hereby) waived (other than those conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date), or at such other time or place as Buyer and the Sellers may agree,  _provided however_ , (i) if all such conditions are satisfied or (to the extent permitted hereby) waived on a non-Business Day, the Closing shall be effective as of such date but the Purchase Price shall be payable on the immediately following Business Day, and (ii) if all such conditions are satisfied or (to the extent permitted hereby) waived within five or fewer days prior to such fiscal month end, the parties will work together to consummate the Closing on a Business Day that is not later than seven days after all such conditions are satisfied or (to the extent permitted hereby) waived. At the Closing: 

  

 (a) Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers the Purchase Price (subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 2.03) in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of the Sellers with a bank in New York City designated by Sellers, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or if not so designated, then by certified or official bank check payable in immediately available funds to the order of the Sellers in such amount). 

  

 (b) The Sellers shall deliver to Buyer certificates for the Company Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed thereto. 

  

 Section 2.03 . _Initial Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) No later than 10 days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer the unaudited combined balance sheet of the Companies and the Subsidiaries as of the end of (i) the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing is to occur if the Closing is to occur within the second half of the month in which it occurs and (ii) the month prior to the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing is to occur if the Closing is to occur within the first half of the month in which it occurs (the "Previous Months Balance Sheet"), together with a statement based on the Previous Months Balance Sheet setting forth the Sellers calculation of Working Capital as of the date of the Previous Months Balance Sheet. Buyer shall promptly review such statement of Working Capital, and the parties agree to discuss in good faith any comments or questions that Buyer may have with respect to such statement. The Sellers shall consider in their good faith 

   ##### 

  

    

any reasonable suggestions that Buyer may make or propose with respect to that
statement in making any revisions to the same. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Initial Adjustment Amount" means an amount equal to the
Working Capital as of the date of the Previous Months Balance Sheet _minus_
Base Working Capital. 

  

 (b) The Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section 2.01 shall be increased by the Initial Adjustment Amount if that amount is positive. The Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section 2.01 shall be decreased by the Initial Adjustment Amount if that amount is negative. 

  

 Section 2.04 . _Closing Balance Sheet_. (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 45 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer the Closing Balance Sheet, and a statement based on such Closing Balance Sheet setting forth the Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital. The Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet") shall (x) fairly present the combined financial position of the Companies and the Subsidiaries as at the close of business on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date in a manner that is consistent with the Accounting Policies and (y) include line items substantially consistent with those in the Balance Sheet. 

  

 (b) If Buyer disagrees with the Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a), Buyer may, within 30 days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section 2.04(a), deliver a notice to the Sellers disagreeing with such calculation and which specifies Buyers calculation of such amount and, in reasonable detail, Buyers grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees, and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet. 

  

 (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b), Buyer and the Sellers shall, during the 20 days following such delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in the Sellers calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) nor less than the amount thereof shown in Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b). If Buyer and the Sellers are unable to reach such agreement during such period, they shall promptly thereafter cause independent accountants (the "Accountants") of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Sellers (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates), promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital. In making such calculation, such independent accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which Buyer 

   ##### 

  

    

has disagreed. Such independent accountants shall deliver to Buyer and the
Sellers, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation.
Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and the Sellers. The cost
of such review and report shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand. 

  

 (d) Buyer and the Sellers agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective independent accountants and the Companies and each Subsidiary to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this Section 2.04, including the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel. 

  

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, the calculations to be made pursuant to this Section 2.04, and the net purchase price adjustment to be made pursuant to Sections 2.03 and 2.05, are meant only to reflect changes in working capital (as adjusted) of the Companies and the Subsidiaries from the Balance Sheet Date to the date of the Closing Balance Sheet and are not intended to provide an alternate remedy for any breach or alleged breach of the Sellers representations and warranties made pursuant to Article 3. 

  

 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that Base Working Capital was computed excluding the cash balances on September 30, 2006 and that the Initial Adjustment Amount and the Final Adjustment Amount will include such cash balances in accordance with the definition of Working Capital and Final Working Capital. 

  

 Section 2.05 . _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. (a) If (i) the Final Adjustment Amount _plus_ the Purchase Price exceeds (ii) the Initial Adjustment Amount _plus_ the Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(c), the amount of that excess. If (A) the Initial Adjustment Amount _plus_ the Purchase Price exceeds (B) the Final Adjustment Amount _plus_ the Purchase Price, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.05(c), the amount of that excess. 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Final Working Capital" means the Closing Working Capital (y) as shown in the Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a), if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(b); or (z) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by Buyer and the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accountants calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(c); _provided_ that, in no event shall Final Working Capital be more than the Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or less than 

   ##### 

  

    

Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section
2.04(b), and (ii) "Final Adjustment Amount" means Final Working Capital
_minus_ Base Working Capital. 

  

 (c) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.05(a) shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within 10 days after Final Working Capital and the Final Adjustment Amount have been determined by delivery by Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, of a certified or official bank check(s) payable in immediately available funds to the other party or by causing such payments to be wired and credited to such account(s) of such other party as may be designated by such other party(ies). The amount of any payment(s) to be made pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the 1 month USD LIBOR in effect from time to time during the period such unpaid amount remains outstanding plus one-fifth percent (0.20%), calculated on a daily basis using actual days/360.

   ##### 

  

  

any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries or with respect to the income,
assets, properties or operations of any of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries. All material deficiencies proposed as a result of any completed
audits have been paid or settled, or are being contested in
appropriate proceedings in the ordinary course and have been taken into
account or are set forth in the books of the Sellers, the Companies and their
Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP.

   

 (g) None of the Companies and their Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (or any similar group defined under a similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), other than a group the common parent of which was VF Parent, for any taxable period for which the applicable statute of limitations has not expired. VF Parent has filed a consolidated U.S. federal Income Tax Return with Vanity Fair Ventures, Inc. and its U.S. subsidiaries for the taxable year immediately preceding the current taxable year and is eligible to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election (as defined below).

 (i) No domestic jurisdiction in which a Company or Subsidiary currently does not file Tax returns (whether separately or as part of a reporting group) has asserted in writing that such Company or Subsidiary is required to file Returns. No foreign jurisdiction in which a Company or Subsidiary currently does not file Tax returns (whether separately or as part of a reporting group) has made any such assertion that relates to a material amount of Taxes. 

  

 (j) There is no adjustment under any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax law comparable to Section 481 of the Code that would require any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries to include in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date any material amount of taxable income attributable to cash or other 

   ##### 

  

  

property that was received, but was not, or will not be, included as income in
a Pre-Closing Tax Period. To the knowledge of the Sellers, none of the
Companies or their Subsidiaries will be required to include any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for a Post-
Closing Tax Period as a result of any: (A) "closing agreement" as described in
Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date;
(B) intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in
Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or

No material property of the Companies or their Subsidiaries is "tax exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code. 

  

 (m) To the knowledge of the Sellers, no Person providing services to any of the Companies and their Subsidiaries who, for any taxable year or taxable period for which the applicable statute of limitations has not yet expired, was or is being treated by the Companies and their Subsidiaries as an independent contractor for Tax purposes, was or is required to have been classified as an employee for Tax purposes. The Companies and their Subsidiaries have each timely withheld, collected and paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority all material Taxes required to have been withheld, collected or paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any lender, shareholder, employee, creditor, independent contractor or other Person with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.03 _. Tax Covenants._ (a) Buyer and VF Parent agree to make a timely, effective and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any comparable statutes in any other jurisdiction with respect to Vanity Fair Ventures, Inc. and each of its domestic Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"), and to file such election in accordance with applicable regulations. The Sellers shall pay any Tax attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and will indemnify Buyer, the Companies and their Subsidiaries against and agree to hold them harmless from any payment of any such Tax. The Section 338(h)(10) Election shall properly reflect the Allocation Statement. Buyer, on the one side, and VF Parent, on the other side, shall bear their respective administrative, legal, accounting and similar expenses resulting from the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any defense of the reported positions of the parties based on the Allocation Statement. The Sellers agree to cooperate fully with respect to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. 

  

 (b) Buyer agrees to indemnify the Sellers for any additional Tax owed by the Sellers (including Tax owed by the Sellers due to this indemnification payment) resulting from any transaction engaged in by the Companies or their Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyers purchase of the Company Shares. Buyer and the Sellers agree to report all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyers purchase of the Company Shares on Buyers federal Income Tax Return (and any comparable state, local or other Returns) to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any comparable state, local or other provision). The Sellers agree to give prompt notice to Buyer of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any action or proceeding, in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article 8\. Buyer may participate in any such suit, action or proceeding at its own expense and the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. 

  

 (c) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, none of the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall make or change any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file any amended Returns or claims for Tax refunds, enter into any closing agreement, surrender any Tax claim, audit or assessment, surrender any right to a Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment, if any such actions, considered in the aggregate, would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax Asset of any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries for a Post-Closing Tax Period. 

  

 (d) The Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be filed (taking into account any extension of a required filing date) all Income Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax period that ends 

   ##### 

  

  

on or before the Closing Date, and shall promptly pay all Taxes due thereon.
Without limiting the foregoing, for all taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date, VF Parent shall cause Vanity Fair Ventures, Inc. and its
U.S. Subsidiaries to join in VF Parents consolidated federal Income Tax
Return and, in jurisdictions requiring separate reporting from VF Parent, to
file separate company state and local Income Tax Returns. Any Separate Return
filed pursuant to this Section 8.03(d) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past Tax accounting practices and methods (except as required
by a change in applicable law) and without a change of any election or any
accounting method, and drafts of such Separate Returns shall be submitted by
the Sellers to the Buyer (together with schedules, statements and, to the
extent reasonably requested by Buyer, supporting documentation) at least 45
days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Returns for Buyers
review and comment.

   

 (e) VF Parent shall include the income of Vanity Fair Ventures, Inc. and its U.S. Subsidiaries (including any deferred items triggered into income by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-19) on VF Parents consolidated federal Income Tax Returns for all periods through the end of the Closing Date and shall timely pay any federal Income Taxes attributable to such income. 

  

 (f) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers all refunds of Income Taxes and interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries that are attributable to Income Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that were paid by (i) the Sellers (or any predecessor or Affiliate of any Seller) (including any such Taxes paid in respect of any liability of the Companies or their Subsidiaries or pursuant to Section 8.06(a)), except for Taxes for which Buyer or its Affiliates indemnified the Sellers pursuant to Section 8.03(b), or (ii) the Companies and their Subsidiaries (but only to the extent such Taxes in (ii) were paid prior to the Closing). If, in lieu of receiving any such refund, any Company or any of its Subsidiaries reduces a Tax liability with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period or increases a Tax Asset that can be carried forward to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers the amount of such reduction in Tax liability or the amount of any benefit resulting from such increase in Tax Assets, as the case may be, when actually realized. Notwithstanding the above, payments pursuant to this Section 8.03(f) shall only be made to the extent that any such refund, reduction in Tax liability or increase in Tax Assets exceeds any actual increase in the liability of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (or of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer required to take items of the Companies or their Subsidiaries into account in computing its Tax liability) for Taxes for any Post-Closing Tax Period as a result of the Tax position underlying such refund, reduction in Tax liability or increase in Tax Assets. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall be borne and timely paid by the Sellers. The Sellers shall, at their own expense, file all necessary Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes. The Sellers shall indemnify, and hereby agree to reimburse and hold harmless, Buyer, the Companies and their Subsidiaries in respect of any liability for payment of or failure to pay any such Taxes or the filing of or failure to file any Returns required in connection therewith. 

  

 (h) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Returns (other than Returns required to be filed by the Sellers under Section 8.03(c)) required to be filed by any Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date that includes any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all such Returns. Any such Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past tax accounting practices and methods (except as required by a change in applicable law) and without a change of any election or any accounting method, and drafts of Income Tax and other material Returns shall be submitted by Buyer to the Sellers (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Sellers, supporting documentation) at least 45 days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Return. The Sellers shall have the right at their own expense to review all work papers and procedures used to prepare any such Return. If any Seller, within 10 business days after delivery of any such Return, notifies Buyer in writing that it objects to any items in such Return, the disputed items shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Return) by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen by and mutually acceptable to both Buyer and the Sellers. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Return shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution and shall be binding upon the parties without further adjustment. The costs, fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. 

  

 (i) Prior to Closing, each Seller shall deliver to Buyer an affidavit of non-foreign status in a form that satisfies the requirements of Section 1445(b)(2) of the Code. 

  

 Section 8.04 _. Tax Sharing._ Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements between any Company or Subsidiary and any member of a Seller Group shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date, none of the Companies, their Subsidiaries, any Seller nor any Affiliate of the Sellers shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder. 

  

 Section 8.05 _. Cooperation on Tax Matters._ Buyer and the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and 

   ##### 

  

  

assistance (including making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to explain any materials provided hereunder) relating to the Companies
and their Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any
Return (including any report required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code
and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), for the preparation for
any audit and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any proposed adjustment. Buyer and the Sellers agree to retain or
cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to the Companies and
their Subsidiaries with respect to Tax matters relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period until the applicable period for assessment under Applicable Law
(including, to the extent notified by the Buyer or the Sellers, any extension
or waiver thereof) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with
all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer
and the Sellers agree to give reasonable notice prior to
transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and records relating to
Tax matters and, if a party so requests, the Buyer or Sellers, as the case
may be, shall allow the requesting party to take possession of such books and
records. Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other in the conduct
of any audit or other proceeding involving the Companies and their
Subsidiaries for any Tax purposes and each shall execute and deliver such
powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this subsection.

   

 Section 8.06 _. Indemnification by the Sellers._ (a) The Sellers hereby jointly and severally indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined below) against and agree to hold them harmless from: 

   

 (i) Any Income Tax (or non-payment thereof) of any Company or any Subsidiary relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; 

   

 (ii) Any and all Income Taxes of any member (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) of a Seller Group of which any of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation; and 

   

 (iii) All liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses) arising out of or incident to any such Tax pursuant to Section 8.06(a)(i) and Section 8.06(a)(ii), including (x) Damages incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax and (y) Damages incurred while cooperating with Sellers. 

  

The sum of the Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to Section
8.06(a)(i) through Section 8.06(a)(iii) shall be referred to as a "Loss".

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) For purposes of this Article 8 (and giving effect to Section 8.03(b)), in the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on (and included) the Closing Date, except for real and personal property Taxes, which shall be prorated on a per diem basis. Any credits relating to a Taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period ended on (and included) the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies and their Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) If the Sellers indemnification obligation under this Section 8.06 arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or its Subsidiary any deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other Tax benefit (a "Tax Benefit") which would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then any payment by the Sellers to Buyer shall be reduced by any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Buyer Indemnified Party on account of the underlying claim. 

  

 (d) Any payment by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.06 shall be made not later than 30 days after receipt by the Sellers of written notice from Buyer stating that any Loss has been paid by a Buyer Indemnified Party and stating the amount thereof and the indemnity payment requested. 

  

 (e) If any audit, claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8.06 (a "Tax Claim") is asserted in writing against Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall notify the Sellers of such claim or demand within 30 days of receipt thereof ( _provided_ , _however,_  that delay on the part of the Buyer in notifying the Sellers shall relieve the Sellers from any obligation hereunder solely to the extent the Sellers are thereby prejudiced) and shall give the Sellers such information with respect thereto as the Sellers may reasonably request. The Sellers may discharge, at any time, their indemnification obligation under this Section 8.06 by paying to Buyer the amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.06. Except as otherwise provided below, the Sellers may, at their own expense, participate in and, upon notice to Buyer within 30 days of the Sellers receipt of notice regarding a Tax Claim, assume the defense of any such Tax Claim. If the Sellers assume such defense, except as provided below, the Sellers shall control and have the sole responsibility for and sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense, and Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Sellers. The party controlling the defense of any Tax Claim shall (i) keep the other party informed of the status of the proceedings, (ii) provide to the other party copies of all 

   ##### 

  

  

documents delivered or received in connection with such proceedings promptly
following delivery to or receipt from a Taxing Authority, (iii) consult in
good faith with the other party regarding all matters relating to the conduct
of such proceedings and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to provide the other
party with an opportunity to attend as an observer settlement discussions and
other conferences and meetings relating thereto. No settlement, agreement
or acquiescence with respect to any Tax Claim that relates to a Separate
Return shall be made without the consent of Buyer, which Buyer can withhold
in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however,_ that if the Buyer withholds
its consent from a proposed settlement, agreement or acquiescence, the
Sellers shall be entitled to turn over control and sole responsibility for
the conduct of the defense of such Tax Claim to the Buyer upon written notice
to Buyer, in which case the Sellers indemnification obligation under Section
8.06(a) with respect to such Tax Claim shall be no greater than the amount
that Sellers would have paid had Buyer consented to such proposed
settlement, agreement or acquiescence (and such amount shall be promptly
remitted to Buyer at such time, subject to Buyers obligation to promptly
refund to the Sellers any such amount or portion thereof not actually
remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority upon final resolution of such Tax
Claim). Whether or not Buyer or the Sellers choose to defend or prosecute any
claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof.

   

 (f) The Sellers shall not be liable under this Section 8.06 for (i) any Tax the payment of which was made without the Sellers prior written consent (unless otherwise required by applicable law) or (ii) any settlements effected without the consent of the Sellers, or resulting from any claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding with respect to which the Sellers were not notified pursuant to Section 8.06(e), _provided_ that in each case such limitations on liability shall only apply to the extent the Sellers were prejudiced as a result thereof. 

  

 Section 8.07 _. Purchase Price Adjustment._ Any amount paid by the Sellers or Buyer under Article 8 or Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

ARTICLE 9 
 Employee Benefits  

   

 Section 9.01 _. References._ References in this Article 9 to Sellers and Buyer shall be deemed to be references to such entities and their respective Affiliates (including the Companies and Subsidiaries), as appropriate. 

  

 Section 9.02 _. U.S. Employees._ (a) Buyer and the Sellers shall enter into an Employee Secondment Agreement effective as of the Closing Date, based upon the terms set forth in the term sheet attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "Employee Secondment Agreement"). For the 90-day period commencing as of 

   ##### 

  

  

the Closing Date, Sellers shall make available to Buyer the Active U.S.
Business Employees subject to and in accordance with the terms of the
Employee Secondment Agreement. Buyer shall offer employment to each Active
U.S. Business Employee effective as of the date immediately following this
90-day period (the "U.S. Employee Transition Date"), conditioned on the
continued employment of such Active U.S. Business Employee with Sellers as of
the date preceding the U.S. Employee Transition Date. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, if an Active U.S. Business Employee is not actively at work as of
the U.S. Employee Transition Date due to an illness, short-term
disability leave or other Seller-approved leave of absence, the offer of
employment by Buyer to such Active U.S. Business Employee shall be effective
as of the first date that such Active U.S. Business Employee is willing and
able to return to actively-at-work status, _provided_ such date is not
later than six months from the end of the U.S. Employee Transition Date.
Buyer shall offer the Active U.S. Business Employees an initial level of
compensation, aggregate benefits, position, job location and work facilities
which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the those enjoyed by
such Active U.S. Business Employees as of the Closing Date (excluding
any equity-based compensation).

   

 (b) If Buyer relocates the job location of any salaried Active U.S. Business Employee during the first twelve months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide competitive relocation benefits to such Active Business Employee. 

  

 (c) If, within the first twelve months after the Closing, an Active U.S. Business Employee is dismissed by reason of redundancy or otherwise rendered redundant, such Active U.S. Business Employee shall receive severance benefits no less favorable to such employee than the protections and benefits set forth in _Section 9.02(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (d) Buyer shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to initially provide to each Active U.S. Business Employee who transfers employment to Buyer coverage under one or more medical and dependent care flexible spending account plans sponsored by Buyer, one of the Companies or one of the Subsidiaries ("Buyers 125 Plan") as of the date that such Active U.S. Business Employee transfers employment ("Sellers 125 Plan"). 

  

 (e) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cover, or cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to cover, the Active U.S. Business Employees under one or more Code Section 401(k) defined contribution plans and trusts qualifying under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). The Buyer 401(k) Plan shall be comparable to the VF Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried Employees and the VF Retirement Savings Plan for Hourly Employees (collectively, the "Seller 401(k) Plan"). The Buyer 401(k) Plan shall permit each Active U.S. Business Employee to make a "direct rollover" to the Buyer 401(k) Plan of his or her distributable account balance and any participant loan notes, if any, under the Sellers qualified plans. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.03 _. International Employees._ (a) Each Active International Business Employee shall transfer employment to the Buyer affiliated group coincident with the transfer of title to the Shares to Buyer hereunder. Where Applicable Law provides for the transfer of employment of an Active International Business Employee upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall assume and honor all terms and conditions of employment in respect of such Active International Business Employee as required by Applicable Law. Where Applicable Law does not provide for the transfer of employment of an Active International Business Employee upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall make offers of employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to such Active International Business Employee. The terms of each International Business Employees transfer or offer of employment hereunder shall be sufficient to avoid statutory and common law severance obligations in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Active International Employee employed in Hong Kong shall be covered by the Employee Secondment Agreement and his or her employment shall transfer to the Buyer affiliated group, and Buyer shall make an offer of employment to such Active International Employee, coincident with the expiration of the term thereof. 

  

 (b) If, within the first twelve months after the Closing, an Active International Business Employee is dismissed by reason of redundancy or otherwise rendered redundant, such Active International Business Employee shall receive notice pay and severance benefits equal to the greater of (i) the notice pay and severance benefits to which such employee is entitled under such Active International Business Employees terms and conditions of employment or (ii) the notice pay and severance benefit that would be available under the applicable severance arrangement covering the Active International Business Employee as of the date hereof as required by Applicable Law. 

  

 (c) Buyer shall cooperate with, and provide timely assistance to, the Sellers and their Affiliates with respect to any required consultation or other requirements with respect to any works councils, employee representatives and/or unions in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the transfer of the Active International Business Employees. For the purposes of enabling the Sellers and their Affiliates to comply with their obligations to inform and consult pursuant to Applicable Law, Buyer shall give such information in writing to the Sellers as any Seller may reasonably request and shall provide such copies of documents or attend such meetings with representatives of the Active International Business Employees as any Seller may reasonably require, with out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection therewith to be reimbursed by such Seller. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.04 _. Service Credit._ Buyer shall provide credit for all prior service by all Active Business Employees with any Seller or its Affiliates or with any Company or Subsidiary as of the Closing Date for purposes of participation eligibility and vesting under all benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements provided to transferring Active Business Employees following the Closing Date, except that Buyer shall not be required to provide credit for such prior services for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan. 

  

 Section 9.05 _. Welfare Benefit Plans._ Buyer shall have welfare benefit plans in effect as of the 90th day following the Closing Date providing continuous uninterrupted medical, dental and vision benefits, life insurance (including ADandD coverage) and short-term and long-term disability benefits to the transferring Active Business Employees and their dependents who immediately prior to the Closing Date were covered under welfare benefit plans of the Sellers, the Companies or the Subsidiaries providing such benefits. Buyer shall cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations or other restrictions that would prevent immediate and full participation of any transferring Active Business Employees (or their eligible dependents) under any such welfare benefit plans (including, without limitation, medical, dental, short-term disability and long-term disability plans) to the extent such limitations and restrictions would not apply under similar plans of the Sellers, the Companies and the Subsidiaries as in effect prior to the Closing. In those countries in which health benefits are subject to co-payments or deductibles, for the plan year during which the Closing occurs, Buyer will give to the transferring Active Business Employees and their eligible dependents full credit for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing as if coverage had been continuous under a single plan. 

  

 Section 9.06 _. Accrued Vacation Days._ Buyer shall assume and honor all vacation days accrued under the vacation policies of the Sellers, the Companies and the Subsidiaries but not yet taken by each transferring Active Business Employee as of the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 9.07 _. Workers  Compensation. _Buyer shall assume all obligations and liability relating to all workers compensation claims incurred by any Business Employee on or after January 1, 2001. 

  

 Section 9.08 _. No Employee Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no Business Employee shall have any contractual rights (as a third party beneficiary or otherwise) with respect to any provisions of this Article 9 or any other provision of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing in this Article 9 or any other provision of this Agreement shall affect the at-will status of any Business Employee or be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan, arrangement or policy covering any Business Employee or any dependant of any Business Employee.

ARTICLE 11 
 Survival; Indemnification 

   

 Section 11.01. _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement (other than those contained in Section 3.21) or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing until the date that is 545 days after the Closing Date; _provided_ that the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 3.18 and 8.02 (collectively, the "Seller Excluded Representations") and Sections 4.01, 4.03, 4.08 and 4.09 (collectively, the "Buyer Excluded Representations") shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by law. The representations and warranties of Sellers contained in Section 3.21 shall survive the Closing until the date that is seven (7) years after the Closing Date, and the indemnification for Identified Environmental Matters set forth in Section 11.02(a)(z) below shall survive the Closing until the date that is ten (10) years after the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for the shorter period explicitly specified herein or therein, except that for such covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter period, breaches thereof (other than a breach of the indemnification for Identified Environmental Matters) shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by law. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time. No representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any party contained in this Agreement shall be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation or knowledge of another party. 

  

 Section 11.02. _Indemnification_. (a) Effective at and after the Closing, the Sellers hereby jointly and severally indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns and each of the foregoings respective officers, directors, managers and employees and, effective upon the Closing, the Companies or the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against and agree to hold each of them harmless from any and all damage, loss and expense (including reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket expenses of investigation and reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding whether involving a third party claim or a claim solely between the parties hereto) ("Damages") actually suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of (w) any misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty made by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, without giving effect to any qualification relating to materiality or 

   ##### 

  

  

Material Adverse Effect contained therein (each such misrepresentation and
breach of warranty a "Warranty Breach"), (x) any breach of covenant or
agreement made or to be performed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement,
(y) the Disclosed Litigation Matters and (z) the Identified Environmental
Matters; _provided_ that with respect to indemnification by the Sellers for
Warranty Breaches (other than breaches of or inaccuracies in the Seller
Excluded Representations) pursuant to this Section, (i) no Seller shall be
liable for any individual Warranty Breach unless the aggregate amount of
Damages from or in connection with such Warranty Breach exceeds $100,000
and then only to the extent of such excess, (ii) no Seller shall be liable
for any individual Warranty Breach unless the Damages arising from or in
connection with that individual Warranty Breach, together with the Damages
arising from or in connection with all other Warranty Breaches,
exceeds $4,500,000, and (iii) the Sellers maximum liability for all such
Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $35,000,000 (the "Warranty Cap"), and
provided further that, in connection with the Identified Environmental
Matters, the Sellers maximum liability shall not exceed $15,000,000
(the "Identified Environmental Cap") plus any amounts under the Warranty Cap
that may be still available after such time, if any, that the Identified
Environmental Cap has been reached. In no event shall the Sellers liability
under this Article 11 (other than with respect to the Disclosed
Litigation Matters) exceed the Purchase Price.

   

 (b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies each Seller, its Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns, and each of the foregoings officers, directors, managers and employees, against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually suffered by any of them arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty made by the Buyer, without giving effect to any qualification relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained therein ("Buyer Warranty Breach") or breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that, due to the French Companys status as a "societe en nom collectif", Sellers and their Affiliates may under French Applicable Law be liable to third parties following the Closing for the liabilities of the French Company incurred during or relating to the period preceding the completion of the formalities required under French law in connection with the sale of the shares of the French Company (the "French Statutory Liabilities"). Buyer agrees to indemnify the Sellers and their Affiliates against and to hold each of them harmless from any such French Statutory Liabilities, except to the extent Buyer is otherwise indemnified by Sellers therefore under Section 8.06 or Section 11.02(a) (it being understood that nothing herein shall affect any rights Buyer may have under Section 8.06 or Section 11.02(a) hereof). With respect to Sections 4.03, 4.04 and 4.07, (i) Buyer shall not be liable for any individual Buyer Warranty Breach unless the aggregate amount of Damages from or in connection with such Buyer Warranty Breach exceeds $100,000 and then only to the extent of such excess, (ii) Buyer shall not be liable for any individual Buyer Warranty 

   ##### 

  

  

Breach unless the Damages arising from or in connection with that individual
Buyer Warranty Breach, together with the Damages arising from or in
connection with all other Buyer Warranty Breaches, exceeds $4,500,000, and
(iii) Buyers maximum liability for all such Buyer Warranty Breaches shall
not exceed $35,000,000. In no event shall the Buyers liability under this
Article 11 (other than with respect to the French Statutory Liabilities)
exceed the Purchase Price.

   

 Section 11.03. _Procedures_. (a) Any party seeking indemnification under Section 6.04 or Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding (each, a "Claim") or the need to perform an Environmental Investigation, in each case in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section, and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent) such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim asserted by any third party, including a Governmental Authority (each, a "Third Party Claim") for which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, shall control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, including the defense of the Disclosed Litigation Matters, in each case at its expense, unless it provides written notice to such Indemnified Party that it will not control such defense within 20 days of its receipt of the related Claim. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.03 and in all cases in relation to the Disclosed Litigation Matters (the defense of which shall be controlled by the Indemnifying Party as per Section 11.03(b) above), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, unless such settlement (1) releases the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim, (2) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (3) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party is also a party to a Third Party Claim or Disclosed Litigation Matter and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, the Indemnifying Party may not assume (or continue to assert) control of the defense of any such matter and instead the Indemnified Party may control the defense of such matter with counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and the Disclosed Litigation Matters and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith, with all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation to be promptly reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (e) (i) It is agreed and understood that, subject to the terms of this Agreement, any Environmental Investigations voluntarily performed by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates shall not serve to limit Sellers indemnity obligations for Environmental Matters as provided for in this Article 11, _provided_ , _however_ , that the costs of all initial Environmental Investigations conducted voluntarily by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates prior to bringing a related Claim hereunder against Sellers shall not be indemnifiable Damages under this Article 11\. Each of the Sellers, Buyer and their respective Affiliates agree to maintain in strict confidence the results of such initial Environmental Investigations, unless required to be disclosed by any law or disclosed in accordance with Section 11.03(e)(ii) or Section 11.03(e)(iii). Subject to any available joint defense privilege or other privilege available under law, Buyer agrees to provide Sellers with copies of all final reports prepared by or for Buyer or its Affiliates as a result of any initial Environmental Investigation conducted by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates. 

   

 (ii) With respect to Environmental Matters (including the Identified Environmental Matters) concerning soil, surface water or groundwater contamination for which the Sellers are obligated to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party under this Article 11, the Sellers shall have the option, by providing written notice of their election to the Buyer Indemnified Party within 20 business days of its receipt of a Claim from Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification under Section 11.02(a), to assume exclusive control of the resolution of such Claim and underlying Environmental Matter, including, without limitation, the exclusive option to obtain, prepare or carry out any tests, reports, surveys and workplans to define, delineate, remediate or address any contamination or noncompliance, to conduct remediation, and to contact, report to, and negotiate and otherwise deal with Governmental Authorities (collectively, the "Remedial Action"). For all Environmental Matters concerning soil, surface water or groundwater contamination indemnifiable under Section 11.02(a) which the Sellers elect to control, the Sellers shall (1) when required, notify the appropriate Governmental Authority or Authorities with jurisdiction over the Remedial Action of the 

   ##### 

  

  

existence of the Environmental Matter, unless such notice is not required by
law and the parties agree not to submit such notice, (2) be required to act
only in a "Commercially Reasonable Manner" and to institute Remedial Action
based upon the use of the subject property for industrial purposes, or if the
subject property was used for commercial purposes as of the Closing, based
upon the use of the subject property for commercial purposes and (3) with
respect to a Remedial Action over which Governmental Authorities are
exercising jurisdiction, obtain, if available from such
Governmental Authorities, a "no further action" or similar written
determination indicating that no additional Remedial Action is required to be
completed with respect to the underlying Environmental Matter, _provided_
such letter may contain exceptions for new findings of soil, surface water or
groundwater contamination or land use changes that would invalidate or
otherwise alter the basis upon which the letter was issued (an "NFA Letter"),
_provided, however,_ for the sake of clarity, to the extent there are any
such new findings, the issuance of the prior NFA Letter shall not prejudice
the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from bringing a Claim for
indemnification under Section 11.02(a) if that new finding would otherwise
have qualified as an indemnifiable matter under this Article 11. With respect
to such Environmental Matters, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate with the Sellers in providing all necessary and
reasonably requested access to properties, facilities and relevant employees
and providing the Sellers with copies of all communications relating to such
matters sent to and received from any third party, _provided_ that the
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or limit any
interference with the normal business operations of the Company
and Subsidiaries and _provided, further,_ that Buyer agrees to, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with the Sellers in the
Sellers efforts to avoid or limit such interference. The Sellers shall give
Buyer reasonable advance notice of, and the right to participate in at
Buyers sole cost, any formal discussions or negotiations with
any Governmental Authority concerning the Remedial Action, as well as the
right to review in advance and provide comments on any documents proposed to
be submitted to Governmental Authorities or other third parties. If the
Sellers are directed or otherwise required to conduct, and do conduct,
Remedial Action with respect to any contamination of the soil, surface water
or groundwater caused by operations conducted at the property after
the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Contamination"), Buyer shall reimburse
the Sellers promptly upon receipt of a request for reimbursement for Damages
the Sellers incurred to address the Post-Closing Contamination. Upon
discovering that a Remedial Action matter may involve Post-Closing
Contamination, the Sellers shall (1) promptly notify Buyer, (2) coordinate
with Buyer regarding the appropriate manner in which to address the Post-
Closing Contamination and (3) obtain Buyers prior approval of any actions to
be taken and Damages to be incurred in connection with such Post-Closing
Contamination.

    ##### 

  

      

 (iii) With respect to Environmental Matters (including the Identified Environmental Matters) concerning soil, surface water or groundwater contamination for which the Sellers are obligated to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party under this Article 11 that Sellers do not elect to control in accordance with Section 11.03(e)(ii) or 11.03(b), Buyer shall assume exclusive control of the resolution of such Claim and underlying Environmental Matter, including, without limitation, the exclusive option to take any Remedial Action. For all Environmental Matters concerning soil, surface water or groundwater contamination indemnifiable under Section 11.02(a) which the Sellers elect to not control, Buyer shall (1) when required, notify the appropriate Governmental Authority or Authorities with jurisdiction over the Remedial Action of the existence of the Environmental Matter, unless such notice is not required by law and the parties agree not to submit such notice, (2) be required to act in a "Commercially Reasonable Manner" and to institute Remedial Action based upon the use of the subject property for industrial purposes, or if the subject property was used for commercial purposes as of the Closing, based upon the use of the subject property for commercial purposes, and for the sake of clarity, the Sellers indemnification obligations under Section 11.02(a) shall be limited to Damages (A) actually incurred for Remedial Actions conducted in a "Commercially Reasonable Manner" and (B) instituted based upon the use of the subject property for industrial or commercial purposes, as appropriate, and (3) with respect to a Remedial Action over which Governmental Authorities are exercising jurisdiction, obtain, if available from such Governmental Authorities, an NFA Letter, _provided, however,_ for the sake of clarity, to the extent there are new findings of soil, surface water or groundwater contamination with respect to any property that is the subject of an NFA Letter, the issuance of the prior NFA Letter shall not prejudice the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from bringing a Claim for indemnification under Section 11.02(a) if such new findings would otherwise have qualified as an indemnifiable matter under this Article 11\. With respect to such matters, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer in providing all necessary and reasonably requested access to relevant employees and providing Buyer with copies of all communications relating to such matters sent to and received from any third party. Buyer shall give, or cause to be given to, Sellers reasonable advance notice of, and the right to participate in, at Sellers sole cost, any formal discussions or negotiations with any Governmental Authority concerning the Remedial Action, as well the right to review in advance and provide comments on any documents proposed to be submitted to Governmental Authorities or other third parties. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 11.04. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor, and (ii) Tax benefit actually and currently realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party in full satisfaction of all Damages actually suffered by the Indemnified Party, such that the Indemnified Party has recovered an amount in excess of his or its Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the amount of such excess, net of any reasonable expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount, to the extent such expenses have not been reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for (i) any Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) there is included in the Closing Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter or (B) the Indemnified Party had otherwise been specifically compensated for such matter pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.05 or (ii) consequential or punitive Damages or Damages for lost profits (other than in connection with a Third Party Claim, Disclosed Litigation Matter or Permit Claim (to the extent such Permit Claim prevents the ordinary business use of any facilities or properties), provided that no punitive Damages shall be available to the Indemnified Party in connection with such Permit Claim). 

  

 Section 11.05. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in full satisfaction of its Damages pursuant to Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have, without incurring any potential material harm to the Business, recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (each, a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. 

  

 Section 11.06. _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, Section 6.04, Section 8.06, Section 11.02 and Section 13.12 will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement (other than those contained in Section 2.05) or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   #####

 Section 12.01. _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

   

 (a) by mutual written agreement of the Sellers and Buyer;

 (c) by Buyer if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 10.02 are incapable of being satisfied on or before the End Date (other than through the failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and Buyer has not waived such condition on or before the Closing Date; or 

   

 (d) by the Sellers if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 10.03 are incapable of being satisfied on or before the End Date (other than through the failure of the Sellers to comply with their obligations under this Agreement) and the Sellers have not waived such condition on or before the Closing Date. 

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses 12.01(b)-
12.01(d) shall give notice of such termination to the other party.

If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other parties to this Agreement; _provided_ that if such termination shall result from the willful (i) failure of a party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other parties, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by a party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 13.03, 13.05, 13.06 and 13.07 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.

Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.

Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall take all such action as may be necessary to continue that appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent so that each of the Sellers and Buyer will at all times have an agent for service of process for the above purposes in Wilmington, Delaware. In the event of the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and business of the process agent to any other entity by consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise, such other entity shall be substituted hereunder for the process agent with the same effect as if named herein in place of the corporation trust company.

No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto, the other Buyer Indemnified Parties and other Seller Indemnified Parties (but in the latter two cases solely with respect to the indemnification obligations contained herein), and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 13.09. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to their subject matter, and those agreements supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to their subject matter.

 Section 13.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 Section 13.11. _Disclosure Schedules_. The Sellers have set forth information on the Seller Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of a Schedule need not be set forth in any other section so long as its relevance to such other section of the Schedule or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Schedules to this Agreement may include certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (ii) the disclosure by the Sellers of any matter in the Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Sellers that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material. 

  

 Section 13.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Employee Secondment Agreement were not performed in accordance with their terms, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Employee Secondment Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of their terms and provisions in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 13.13 _. Parent Guarantee._ In consideration of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Sellers that Parent shall pay, perform or discharge, or cause to be paid, performed or discharged all obligations, liabilities and undertakings of Buyer under this Agreement in the event Buyer shall fail to pay, perform or discharge such obligations, liabilities or undertakings. Without limiting the foregoing, in such event, Parent shall be afforded all of the same rights, protections, limitations and defenses as are afforded to Buyer under this Agreement.
