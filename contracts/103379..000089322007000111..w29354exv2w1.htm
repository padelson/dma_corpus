subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers agree to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees
to purchase from the Sellers, the Company Shares and the Advances at the Closing. The aggregate
purchase price (the &#147;<B>Purchase Price</B>&#148;) for the Company Shares and the Advances is $350,000,000. The
Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section&nbsp;2.02 and shall be subject to net adjustment as
provided in Sections&nbsp;2.03 and 2.05.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Sellers and Buyer agree that Purchase Price (as adjusted) shall be allocated among the
Company Shares and to the Advances as follows: (i) $1,000,000 to the outstanding shares of capital
stock of VFG Dessous Vertriebs GmbH, (ii) $1,000,000 to the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the French Company, (iii) $19,000,000 to the Advances and (iv)&nbsp;the balance to the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Vanity Fair Ventures, Inc. The aggregate deemed sales price of the
assets of Vanity Fair Ventures Inc. (as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.338-4) shall be allocated among those assets (and among the assets of its U.S. Subsidiaries) in a
manner consistent with the fair market values set forth in an allocation schedule (the &#147;<B>Allocation
Statement</B>&#148;) to be prepared by Buyer within 120&nbsp;days of the Closing Date and approved by the
Sellers. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on an allocation within 30&nbsp;days of the
preparation of the Allocation Statement, then the parties agree to be bound by an Allocation
Statement prepared by independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and the Sellers (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or
the Sellers) (&#147;<B>Independent Accountants</B>&#148;). The Sellers and Buyer agree that the Allocation
Statement shall reflect the fair market value determinations set forth on Section&nbsp;2.01(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. If an adjustment is made (or deemed to be made) with respect to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.03, 2.05 or Section&nbsp;8.07, the Allocation Statement shall be
adjusted to reflect the net adjustment as mutually agreed by Buyer and the Sellers. In the event
that the parties are unable to agree on an allocation within 30&nbsp;days of an adjustment, then the
parties agree to be bound by an adjustment prepared by Independent Accountants. Fees and other
costs of the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other. The Sellers and Buyer agree to be bound by the Allocation Statement (as
adjusted) for all purposes and to not take any position that is in any way inconsistent with the
terms of the Allocation Statement (as adjusted) in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax
return or in any administrative or judicial proceeding. In the event any reported position based
on the Allocation Statement is audited or disputed by any Governmental Authority, or otherwise, the
party hereto receiving notice thereof shall promptly notify the other parties hereto. The Sellers

With respect to such Environmental Matters, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates

Subsidiaries and <I>provided, further, </I>that Buyer agrees to, and shall cause its Affiliates

participate in at Buyer&#146;s sole cost, any formal discussions or negotiations with any
Governmental Authority concerning the Remedial Action, as well as the right to review in
advance and provide comments on any documents proposed to be submitted to Governmental
Authorities or other third parties. If the Sellers are directed or otherwise required to
conduct, and do conduct, Remedial Action with respect to any contamination of the soil,
surface water or groundwater caused by operations conducted at the property after the
Closing Date (the &#147;<B>Post-Closing Contamination</B>&#148;), Buyer shall reimburse the Sellers
promptly upon receipt of a request for reimbursement for Damages the Sellers incurred to
address the Post-Closing Contamination. Upon discovering that a Remedial Action matter
may involve Post-Closing Contamination, the Sellers shall (1)&nbsp;promptly notify Buyer, (2)
coordinate with Buyer regarding the appropriate manner in which to address the
Post-Closing Contamination and (3)&nbsp;obtain
Buyer&#146;s prior approval of any actions to be taken and Damages to be incurred in
connection with such Post-Closing Contamination.</DIV>
