prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule setting forth in detail the Company&#146;s good faith
best estimate of the Company&#146;s Medical Claims incurred but not reported, and Medical Claims
incurred and reported but pending or otherwise unpaid as of the Effective Date based upon
the Company&#146;s claims experience and sound accounting and actuarial practices, as applicable,
consistently applied (such estimate is referred to herein as the &#147;Medical Claims Reserve&#148;).
Within 210&nbsp;days following the Effective Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and
deliver to Sellers a reconciliation of the Medical Claims Reserve to the aggregate dollar
amount (such aggregate dollar amount, the &#147;Company&#146;s 180 Day Loss Experience&#148;) of: (a)&nbsp;all
Medical Claims incurred before the Effective Date that are paid during the 180&nbsp;day period
immediately following the Effective Date; (b)&nbsp;the reserve estimate for Medical Claims
incurred prior to the Effective Date but not reported as of the end of such 180&nbsp;day period;
and (c)&nbsp;the reserve estimate for Medical Claims incurred prior to the Effective Date and
reported but pending or otherwise unpaid as of the end of such 180&nbsp;day period. In the event
the Company&#146;s 180 Day Loss Experience is less than the Medical Claims Reserve, Buyer shall
pay the difference to Sellers in cash or by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five (5)&nbsp;business days following final determination of such reconciliation (as
described below). In the event the Company&#146;s 180 Day Loss Experience exceeds the Medical
Claims Reserve, Sellers shall pay the difference to Buyer in cash or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5)&nbsp;business days following final determination of
such reconciliation (as described below).

prepare a second reconciliation of the Medical Claims Reserve to the aggregate dollar amount
(such aggregate dollar amount, the &#147;Company&#146;s 18 Month Loss Experience&#148;) of: (a)&nbsp;all Medical
Claims incurred before the Effective Date and paid during the 18&nbsp;month period immediately
following the Effective Date; and (b)&nbsp;the reserve estimate for Medical Claims incurred prior
to the Effective Date and reported but that remain pending or otherwise unpaid as of the end
of such 18&nbsp;month period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company&#146;s 18 Month Loss Experience
will not include any reserve estimate for Medical Claims incurred prior to the Effective
Date but not reported. In the event, as finally determined, (A)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s 18 Month Loss
Experience, plus the amount of any payment by Buyer to Sellers as described in (i)&nbsp;above or
less the amount of any payment by the Sellers to Buyer as described in (i)&nbsp;above, as
applicable, is less than (B)&nbsp;the Medical Claims Reserve, Buyer shall pay the difference to
Sellers in cash or via wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5)&nbsp;business
days following final determination of such reconciliation. In the event, as finally
determined, (A)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s 18 Month Loss

all comments of the Sellers so long as: (i)&nbsp;such comments (a)&nbsp;do not result in a finding or

assessment, deficiency or other adjustment or proposed adjustment of Taxes for any taxable
period ending prior to the Effective Date for which Sellers are charged with liability for

trade secrets and with other Confidential Information of the Company. Each Seller

significant loss of goodwill by the Company) if such Seller were to breach the provisions of
this Section&nbsp;9.5. Each Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Section&nbsp;9.5 were a material inducement to Buyer to enter into
this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and that none of Buyer or its
Affiliates would obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as
specifically negotiated by the parties hereto if such Seller breached the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;9.5. Therefore, in further consideration of the amounts to be paid hereunder for
such Seller&#146;s Company Stock and the goodwill of the Company sold by Sellers, each Seller

specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any
breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable injury to
the non-breaching Party and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy. In
addition, in the event that any Seller or an Affiliate or Immediate Family Member of any
Seller breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, the
Company shall have the right and remedy to require such Seller, Affiliate or Immediate
Family Member to account for and pay over to the Company any profits, monies, accruals,
increments or other benefits derived or received by such Person as the result of any
transactions constituting a breach of the Restrictive Covenants from the date such Seller

not take any position that is inconsistent with this <U>Schedule&nbsp;9.5</U> during any Tax
examination, appeal or related judicial proceeding without the prior written consent of the
other Party. The Sellers agree and acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach of the
Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable damage to Buyer and HealthSpring that is
materially greater than the Consideration and accordingly, the Sellers hereby agree that the
Consideration is set for Tax purposes only and is not intended to and shall not be deemed to
limit in any way the monetary Damages that may be asserted or collected by the Buyer Parties
upon any breach of the Restrictive Covenants. The Sellers further agree that in any Action
regarding a breach of the Restrictive Covenants by the Buyer Parties, the Sellers will not
in any manner introduce the amount of the Consideration into the litigation or use the
amount of the Consideration to attempt to limit the amount of Damages which the Buyer
Parties may be entitled to recover as a defense to or to limit the Damage which may be awarded to the
Buyer Parties.

Deposit&#148;), as further described in the Deposit Agreement; provided that the Escrow Agent shall
thereupon distribute to HealthSpring any interest or other earnings with respect to the Financing
Deposit. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver the Financing Deposit, together with any interest or other earnings with respect
thereto, to HealthSpring within three (3)&nbsp;business days in the event the Agreement is terminated
for any reason prior to the satisfaction of the Deposit Release Condition. Upon the release of the
Financing Deposit upon the satisfaction of the Deposit Release Condition, Buyer may, at its sole
option, delay the Closing by up to 30&nbsp;days to permit Buyer additional time to obtain the financing
required for Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
Buyer determines to delay the Closing as described in this Section&nbsp;10.4, Buyer shall deliver
written notice to Sellers and the Company of its exercise of its option to delay the date of the
Closing. In the event that the Parties consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Financing Deposit shall be credited towards, and shall reduce dollar for dollar, the Cash
Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer at Closing. In the event that the Buyer pays the Financing
Deposit and the Parties do not consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other
than as a result of an intentional breach of this Agreement by Sellers or the Company, Sellers
shall retain the Financing Deposit as liquidated damages, this Agreement shall terminate and all
further rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate except with
respect to Section&nbsp;9.2 and Section&nbsp;13. The Parties acknowledge and agree that it would be
impracticable or extremely difficult for any Party to determine the actual damages resulting from
any such breach or failure to perform by Buyer and HealthSpring hereunder and, therefore, the
Parties have agreed upon the foregoing remedy as liquidated damages which shall not be deemed to be
in the nature of a penalty. In the event Buyer elects to delay the Closing as described herein,
the Closing shall be consummated within the first five (5)&nbsp;business days of the first month
following the expiration of the 30-day delay period.

available funds to an account specified to such breaching Party by the other Party, within ten (10)
business days of the effective date of such termination. The Parties acknowledge and agree that it
would be impracticable or extremely difficult for any Party to determine the actual damages
resulting from any such unintentional breach or failure to perform hereunder and, therefore, the
Parties have agreed upon the foregoing remedy as liquidated damages which shall not be deemed to be
in the nature of a penalty. If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section&nbsp;12.1(ii)
or Section&nbsp;12.1(iv) or by Sellers pursuant to Section&nbsp;12.1(iii) or Section&nbsp;12.1(v), in each case,
as a result of any wilfull or intentional breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or any wilfull or intentional failure to perform of the
other Party, then the non-breaching Party(ies) shall be entitled to recover from the breaching
Party(ies), jointly and severally, any and all Damages that the non-breaching Party(ies) shall
suffer or incur connected with, arising out of or otherwise relating to such breach or failure to
perform, including, but not limited to, all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred before or
after the date of this Agreement by such non-breaching Party(ies) related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants and other
consultants and advisors retained by such non-breaching Party(ies) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when one or more counterparts hereof have been
executed by each of the Parties hereto and delivered to the other Parties hereto, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile or e-mail
transmission in PDF format to counsel for the other Party of a counterpart executed by a Party
shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous sentence and to constitute good and

pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation any investigation by or on behalf of any
Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver
by any Party hereto of a breach of any provisions hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

the Closing or any investigation made by or on behalf of any party, and shall continue in full
force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting any remedies against Sellers
hereunder, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company set forth
herein shall terminate effective upon the Closing and shall be of no further force or effect.

to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made in this Agreement unless such
schedule identifies the Section of this Agreement where such representation or warranty is set
forth; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified in such schedule, any schedule
designated by a letter or number shall be deemed to identify the Section in this Agreement
designated by such letter or number, and any disclosures set forth in such
schedule shall be deemed for all purposes to be disclosures and exceptions with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in such Section. No exceptions to any representations or
warranties disclosed on one schedule shall constitute an exception to any other representations or
warranties made in this Agreement unless the exception is disclosed as provided herein on each such
other applicable schedule or cross-referenced in such other applicable section or schedule.

is hereby terminated and extinguished for all purposes and is hereby superseded by this Agreement.
This Agreement applies to the relationship between PROVIDER and PLAN with respect to the provision
of Services by PROVIDER, including, without limitation, through the PROVIDER-operated medical
centers that now or hereafter service the Approved PLAN Operating Areas (the &#147;<B>PROVIDER Medical
Centers</B>&#148;) and/or through Affiliated Providers (as defined in Section&nbsp;11.5), to (i)&nbsp;PLAN&#146;s Medicare

PLAN&#146;s Clinic Model Provider for delivery of Services (&#147;<B>PROVIDER Medicare Members</B>&#148;), and (ii)
PROVIDER HMO Members (as defined in Section&nbsp;7.1(d)). For the purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Clinic
Model Provider&#148; means a medical services provider (1)&nbsp;that employs, or contracts on an exclusive

physician practices.

any Medicare Advantage members who do not reside in an Approved PLAN Operating Area, (2)&nbsp;Medicare

a PROVIDER Medical Center or Affiliated Provider to have capacity to admit one of PLAN&#146;s Medicare

HealthSpring, CMS, DFS, the Agency, DHHS or any other governmental or other regulatory
authority of competent jurisdiction shall require that a Sale of PLAN be effectuated, such
Sale of PLAN (a &#147;Required Divestiture&#148;) shall not require PROVIDER&#146;s consent, so long as

PLAN shall deliver a Notice to PROVIDER setting forth and certifying as to the
material terms of the Transfer Offer (together with copies of all applicable
correspondence and other documents relating thereto) (a &#147;Required Divestiture
Notice&#148;), including the purchase price with respect to such Transfer Offer (the
&#147;Required Divestiture Purchase Price&#148;). The Required Divestiture Notice shall

of its Affiliates designated thereby (any or all of them, collectively, the
&#147;Purchaser&#148;) pursuant to the terms of this Section&nbsp;7.2(b). Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
after the giving of a Required Divestiture Notice, the PROVIDER shall give the PLAN
a Notice (a &#147;Response Notice&#148;) setting forth whether the PROVIDER has elected to
exercise its right of first refusal. The PROVIDER&#146;s failure to timely deliver the
Response Notice shall be deemed to constitute the
PROVIDER&#146;s irrevocable election not to exercise its right of first refusal
solely with respect to such Transfer Offer.
