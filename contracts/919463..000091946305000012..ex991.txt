      is owned by the Company, Purchaser or Sub shall automatically be
      canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
      shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

                           (iii)    each Share issued and outstanding
      immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be
      canceled in accordance with Section 1.5(b)(ii)) shall be converted
      into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration; and

      the number of Shares into which such Preferred Share is
      convertible, determined as of immediately prior to the Effective
      Time.

            Section 1.6   Subsequent Actions

            .  If at any time after the Effective Time any deeds, bills of

Consideration over (ii) the sum of (A) the per share exercise price of such
Options and (B) the Per Share Holdback Amount and (b) the number of Shares
subject to such Options which have not been exercised or otherwise remain

<PAGE>

unless another date or place is agreed in writing by each of the parties
hereto.

            Section 2.2   Delivery of and Payment for Shares.

                  (a)As of the Effective Time, (i) each Share and each
Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in
Section 1.5 and (ii) all such issued and outstanding Shares and Preferred
Shares shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time

cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive such
portion of the consideration into which such Shares and Preferred Shares have
been converted as a result of the Merger upon surrender of such Certificate in

Adjustments Holdback Escrow Account.

            Section 2.3   Lost Certificates

            .  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser will issue or will cause
Sub to issue (or, after the Closing Date, will cause the Surviving Corporation
to issue), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II after taking into account all the Shares then held by such holder
under all such Certificates.

            Section 2.4   Stock Transfer Books

            .  The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.

            .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has not consented to the Merger in writing and who has complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to appraisal.  A
holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
unless, after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
loses any such right to appraisal, in which case such Shares shall be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or
Certificates representing such Shares, pursuant to Section 2.2.

            Section 2.6   Demands for Appraisal

            .  The Company shall give Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL.  Except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
appraisal.

            Section 2.7   Estimated Closing Statement

            .  Not less than two Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing
Date, the Company will deliver to Purchaser a notice (the "Estimated Closing
Statement") indicating its good faith estimate of (a) the Net Working Capital
for the Company as of the Closing ("Estimated Net Working Capital"), minus (b)
Closing Indebtedness, minus (c) Transaction Costs, minus (d) Unused Cap Ex
Amount, plus (e) Closing Cash  (taken together, the "Estimated Closing
Amount"), and (f) the Share Number for the Company as of the Closing, along
with a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Company certifying the
foregoing, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such amounts.  The
Estimated Net Working Capital shall be determined in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently with the application thereof in the Financial Statements,
subject to accounting principles, methodologies, procedures and classifications
as are set forth in Section 2.7 of the Disclosure Schedule.

            Section 2.8   Closing Adjustments.

                  (a)As soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty
(60) days following the Closing (the "Final Calculation Date"), Purchaser shall
prepare a calculation of the following amounts as of the Closing with respect
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "Closing Statement"): the Net
Working Capital (the "Closing Net Working Capital"), Closing Indebtedness,
Transaction Costs, Unused Cap Ex Amount, and Closing Cash (taken together, the
"Closing Amount").  The Closing Net Working Capital shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP applied consistently with the application thereof in the
Financial Statements, subject to accounting principles, methodologies,
procedures and classifications as are set forth in Section 2.7 of the
Disclosure Schedule.
                                   5
<PAGE>

                  (b)Purchaser shall deliver a copy of the Closing Statement to
Sellers' Representative promptly after it has been prepared.  After receipt of
the Closing Statement, Sellers' Representative shall have thirty (30) days to
review the Closing Statement.  Purchaser shall (i) provide Sellers'
Representative and its authorized representatives (including counsel, financial
advisors and auditors) reasonable access during normal business hours to all
relevant work papers, trial balances, employees, internal and external
accountants and auditors, plants, offices, warehouses and other facilities, all
books and records and other financial information to the extent necessary or
useful to complete their review of the Closing Statement, (ii) cause
Purchaser's and its Subsidiaries' officers and advisors (including counsel,
financial advisors and auditors) to furnish Sellers' Representative with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Sellers' Representative may from time to time reasonably request and (iii)
cooperate with Sellers' Representative's reasonable requests with respect to
the review of the Closing Statement.  Unless Sellers' Representative delivers
written notice to Purchaser on or before the 30th day after Sellers'
Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement specifying in reasonable
detail the amount, nature and basis of all disputed items, Sellers'
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement delivered
by Purchaser, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder.  If Sellers' Representative notifies Purchaser of an objection to
the calculation of any amounts in the Closing Statement, Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative shall, within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the
parties may agree in writing) following such notice (the "Resolution Period"),
attempt to resolve their differences and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.

                  (c)If,  at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, there are
any amounts remaining in dispute,  then such amounts remaining in dispute shall
be submitted to Deloitte & Touche LLP  or  another nationally recognized public
accounting  firm  agreed  to  by  Sellers' Representative  and  Purchaser  (the
"Neutral Auditors").  Sellers' Representative  and  Purchaser shall execute, if
requested  by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable engagement  letter,  including
customary indemnities.   The  Neutral  Auditors  shall  act as an arbitrator to
determine,  based  solely  on  the  provisions  of  this Section  2.8  and  the
presentations by Purchaser and Sellers' Representative,  and not by independent
review,  only those issues still in dispute.  Sellers' Representative  and  the
Purchaser   shall  use  reasonable  efforts  to  cause  the  Neutral  Auditors'
determination  to  be  made  within  30 days of the dispute being submitted for
their review.  The Neutral Auditors' determination  shall  be  set  forth  in a
written  statement delivered to Purchaser and Sellers' Representative and shall
be final,  non-appealable  and  binding  on the parties hereto, absent manifest
error or fraud.  A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be entered
upon the Neutral Auditors' determination.   The  Neutral  Auditors  shall  have
exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the Neutral Auditors as provided  in
this  Section  2.8(c)  shall  be  the  only  recourse and remedy of the parties
against  one  another  with  respect  to,  any disputes  with  respect  to  the
calculation of the Final Closing Amount.  The  fees,  costs and expenses of the
Neutral  Auditors  shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one  hand,  and  by  the

Code Sections 412, 4971 or 4980B, or ERISA Sections 302 or 601 through 609, or

provided in such Commitment Letters to be terminated or ineffective, any of the
conditions contained therein not to be met or the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters not to be consummated.  Except for the conditions described
in the Commitment Letters, there are no other conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing.  For the twelve month period ended March 31, 2005, the condition set
forth in paragraph 3 of the summary of conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing was satisfied, and Purchaser has no reason to believe that such
condition will not be satisfied for the latest twelve month period for which

            .  There are no material actions, suits, or proceedings by or

ability of Purchaser or Sub to consummate the Merger or the Transactions.

investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which investigation, review and analysis
was done by Purchaser, Sub and their respective Affiliates and, to the extent
Purchaser and Sub deemed appropriate, by Purchaser's and Sub's representatives.
Each of Purchaser and Sub acknowledges that it and its representatives have
been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, premises and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such purpose.  In
entering into this Agreement, each of Purchaser and Sub acknowledges that it
has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis
and not on any factual representations, opinions, financial projections,
presentations, management summaries or data room materials of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, Fremont, Fremont Partners or of any of their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons,
agents, advisors, attorneys or representatives (except for the specific
representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers, respectively,
set forth in Article III  together with the schedules thereto) and, except with
respect to the specific representations and warranties of the Company and the
Sellers set forth in Article III together with the schedules thereto, each of
Purchaser and Sub agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that none of
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Fremont, Fremont Partners or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, Affiliates,
controlling persons, agents, advisors, attorneys or representatives shall have
any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Purchaser, Sub or their
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons,
agents or representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under
federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information
provided or made available, or statements made (including in the management
summaries relating to the Company provided to Purchaser, in materials furnished
in the Company's data room, in presentations by the Company's management, in
the Confidential Information Memorandum dated February 2005 provided by
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. and Sagent Advisors Inc. or otherwise), to
Purchaser, Sub or their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
controlling persons, advisors, attorneys, agents or representatives (or any
omissions therefrom).

            Section 4.7   Brokers or Finders

            .  Neither Purchaser, Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates has entered into any agreement or arrangement entitling any
agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person to
any broker's or finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee in
connection with any of the Transactions, except Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
JPMorgan Securities Inc., whose fees and expenses will be paid by Purchaser in
accordance with Purchaser's agreement with such firms.

<PAGE>

with respect to the business and properties of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request; provided
that any such access shall be conducted at Purchaser's expense, at a reasonable
time, under the supervision of the Company's personnel and in such a manner as
to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Transactions and not
to interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other agreement between
Purchaser and the Company executed prior to the date hereof, none of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any Stockholder or any Affiliate of any Stockholder shall have
any obligation to make available to Purchaser or its representatives, or
provide Purchaser or its representatives with, any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return filed by any Stockholder or any of their Affiliates (other
than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or predecessors, or any related
material, and nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any
information to Purchaser if such disclosure would in the Company's good faith
judgment (i) include individual customer or per unit pricing data,
(ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or
(iii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality
agreement to which any Stockholder, the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party).

                  (b)The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain binding and in full force and effect.  The information contained herein,
in the Disclosure Schedule or delivered to Purchaser, Sub or their authorized
Representatives pursuant hereto shall be deemed to be Confidential Information
(as defined and subject to the exceptions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement).  Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3 and this Section 5.2,
each of Purchaser and Sub shall cause its Representatives to treat the terms of
this Agreement after the date hereof as strictly confidential (unless compelled
to disclose by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of legal
counsel, by other requirements of Law).

            Section 5.3   Efforts and Actions to Cause Merger to Occur.

                  (a)Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser, Sub, the Company and the Sellers shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done and cooperate with each other in order
to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any applicable
Laws) to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as promptly as
practicable, including the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations
and notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite approvals, authorizations, consents, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers by any third party or Governmental
Entity, and the seeking of the vacation or reversal of any preliminary
injunction, temporary restraining order, stay or other legal restraint or
prohibition entered or imposed by any court or other Governmental Entity that
is not yet final and non appealable.  In addition, no party hereto shall take
any action after the date hereof that could reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,
approval or consent from any Governmental Entity or other Person required to be
obtained prior to Closing.  The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consents and approvals set forth on Section 5.3 of the
Disclosure Schedule.

<PAGE>

                  (b)Each party shall promptly consult with the other party
hereto with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to, and
provide the other parties (or their respective counsel) with copies of, all
filings made prior to Closing by such party with any Governmental Entity or any
other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions.  Each party hereto shall promptly
inform each other party of any communication received by such party from any
Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions.  If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Entity with respect to any of the Transactions, then
such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other parties, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

                  (c)In addition to and without limiting the agreements of the
parties contained above, Purchaser, Sub and the Company shall (i) take promptly
all actions necessary to make the filings required of them or any of their
Affiliates under the HSR Act, (ii) comply, at the earliest practicable date,
with any request for additional information or documentary material received by
the Company, Purchaser, Sub or any of their Affiliates from the FTC or the DOJ
pursuant to the HSR Act or from any state Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, (iii) cooperate with
each other in connection with any filing under the HSR Act and in connection
with resolving any investigation or other inquiry concerning the Transactions
commenced by the FTC, DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other Governmental
Entity, (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any antitrust
Law and (v) advise the other parties promptly of any material communication
received by such party from the FTC, DOJ, any state Attorney General or any
other Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions, and of any
understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such party
proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, DOJ, any state Attorney General or
any other Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions.
Concurrently with the filing of notifications under the HSR Act or as soon
thereafter as practicable, Purchaser, Sub and the Company shall each request
early termination of the HSR Act waiting period.  With regard to Purchaser and
Sub, "reasonable best efforts" for purposes of this Agreement shall not require
Purchaser or Sub to proffer or accept any order providing for the divestiture
by Purchaser or Sub of any properties, assets, operations, or businesses of
Purchaser, Sub, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or to agree to
hold separate any properties, assets, operations or businesses or to accept any
other conditions, restrictions, limitations, or agreements affecting
Purchaser's and Sub's full rights of ownership of the stock or assets of the
Company, Purchaser, Sub and their respective Subsidiaries.

                  (d)The Company and the Sellers shall take such actions and
obtain such governmental approvals, if any, required to be taken or obtained
prior to consummation of the Merger pursuant to the New Jersey Industrial Site
Recovery Act ("ISRA").  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the
Sellers will submit a request for a Letter of Non-Applicability from the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP"), seeking to obtain a
determination from the NJDEP that the Merger is not subject to ISRA and shall
exercise reasonable diligence to obtain such determination prior to Closing.
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and the Sellers with
respect to pre-Closing ISRA-related tasks, including pursuit of the foregoing
                                   28
<PAGE>

determination and, if there is a reasonable risk that such determination cannot
be obtained prior to Closing upon reasonable diligence, executing any other
documents and forms in a timely fashion  required to achieve compliance with
ISRA, including, without limitation and if necessary, an application for a
Remediation Agreement (as such term is defined by ISRA) with respect to each
New Jersey industrial establishment (as such term is defined by ISRA).

                  (e)If in the Sellers' judgment, a Remediation Agreement is
necessary in order to allow for the consummation of the Merger pursuant to
ISRA, the Company shall and/or a relevant subsidiary of the Company shall enter
into a Remediation Agreement for each New Jersey industrial establishment and
be the responsible party pursuant to the Remediation Agreement(s).  If a
Remediation Agreement or Remediation Agreements have been executed in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company and/or a relevant subsidiary of the Company
shall be responsible for  compliance with ISRA after the consummation of the
Merger.  In no event shall Sellers be responsible for compliance with ISRA
after the consummation of the Merger.  Nothing in this Section 5.3(e) shall
impair or diminish, however, any of the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement.

            Section 5.4   Publicity

            .  The initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be a joint press release acceptable to Purchaser and the
Company.  Thereafter, Purchaser, Sub, the Sellers and any of their respective
Affiliates shall not issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other internal or external announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions without prior consultation with the Company and Purchaser, except
as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange or trading market, or to the extent the information
contained therein has previously been publicly disclosed.

            Section 5.5   Employees; Employee Benefits.

                  (a)For a period of one year after the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain plans for the benefit of the
employees of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries that provide
benefits (except with respect to severance, change in control and equity-based
or equity related arrangements) that are not materially less favorable in the
aggregate to such employees than the benefits provided under the Plans
(including cash incentive compensation and cash bonus plans or arrangements),
as of the Closing.

                  (b)With respect to each employee benefit plan, practice,
policy or arrangement of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, each Retained
Employee shall be given credit under such plan, practice, policy or arrangement
for all service with the Company or any predecessor employer (to the extent
such credit was given by the Company or any predecessor employer under a
comparable plan, practice, policy or arrangement), for purposes of determining
eligibility and vesting, and for all other purposes for which such service is
either taken into account or recognized except as would result in a duplication
of benefits.  Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any preexisting condition limitations except as would result in a duplication
of benefits.  Retained Employees shall be given full credit for amounts paid
under any Plan during the same calendar year in which they commence
                                   29
<PAGE>

participation in a comparable employee benefit plan of Purchaser for purposes
of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
comparable employee benefit plan of Purchaser except as would result in a
duplication of benefits.

                  (c)If any Retained Employee is discharged by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as of or after the Closing, then
Purchaser shall be responsible for any and all severance costs for such
Retained Employee, including all payments owing under any Plan.  Purchaser
shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices or payments due
to any Retained Employees, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments due
to any Governmental Entity, pursuant to any applicable Law with respect to the
employment, discharge or layoff of employees by the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries as of or after the Closing, including the WARN Act,
Section 4980B of the Code and any rules or regulations that have been issued in
connection with the foregoing.

                  (d)The Company shall notify the PBGC in writing of the
existence of this Agreement no later than five (5) Business Days after the date
hereof.  Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Purchaser
nor Sub nor any of their agents, assignees, directors or employees shall
contact the PBGC in respect of the Kerr Group, Inc. Retirement Income Plan or
the Transactions prior to the Closing.  Each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to give each other party hereto a reasonable
opportunity to participate in any oral or written communications, discussions
or negotiations with the PBGC.  Each party hereto shall promptly notify each
other party hereto of any communication received from the PBGC, and shall
provide a copy of any such communication that is written.

                  (e)With respect to (i) the Company's cash bonus plans and
(ii) the agreements set forth on Section 5.5(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company shall through the Closing Date properly accrue for such plans and
agreements in its books and records.  On or before the Closing Date, the
Company shall pay to its employees, officers and directors the full amount of
cash bonuses so accrued under such plans and agreements through the Closing
Date.  Before the Closing, the Company shall terminate each of the Company's
cash bonus plans.

                  (f)The Company shall obtain shareholder approval in
accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the final regulations thereunder
so that no payment or benefit which has been, will or may be made (including
giving effect to any past payments or benefits) by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any individual could be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code by reason of a
"change in the ownership," "change in the effective control" or "change in the
ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company or of any
Company Subsidiary occurring by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

            Section 5.6   Intercompany Arrangements.

                  (a)Simultaneously with the Closing, the Company shall pay to

<PAGE>

"Fremont Partners") all accrued and unpaid amounts payable through and
including the Closing Date under the Advisory Services Agreement dated as of
August 12, 2003, by and between the Company and Fremont Partners.  Except as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, all agreements and
commitments, whether written, oral or otherwise, between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Fremont Partners and its Affiliates
(excluding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall
be terminated and of no further effect, simultaneously with the Closing without
any further action or liability on the part of the parties thereto.

commitments, whether written, oral or otherwise, between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and New Canaan Investments, Inc. and its
Affiliates (excluding the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any directors
or officers of the Company), on the other hand, shall be terminated and of no
further effect, simultaneously with the Closing without any further action or
liability on the part of the parties thereto.

            Section 5.7   Maintenance of Books and Records

            .  Each of the parties hereto shall preserve, until at least the
eighth anniversary of the Closing Date, all pre-Closing Date records possessed
or to be possessed by such party relating to the Company.  After the Closing
Date, upon reasonable request from Sellers' Representative, the party holding
such records shall (a) provide to Sellers' Representative reasonable access to
such records during normal business hours and (b) permit Sellers'
Representative to make copies of such records, in each case at no cost to
Sellers' Representative (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses);
provided that nothing herein shall require any party to disclose any
information to any Person if such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege or contravene any applicable Law.  Such records
may be sought under this Section 5.7 for any reasonable purpose, including to
the extent reasonably required in connection with the audit, accounting, tax,
litigation, federal securities disclosure or other similar needs of any
Stockholder or former Stockholder or their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates and employees seeking such records.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any and all such records may be destroyed by a party if such
destroying party sends to the other party written notice of its intent to
destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the
records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the 30th day
following such notice unless the other party notifies the destroying party that
such other party desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event
the destroying party shall transfer the records to Sellers' Representative and
Sellers' Representative shall pay all reasonable expenses of the destroying
party in connection therewith.

            Section 5.8   Directors' and Officers' Insurance and
Indemnification.

                  (a)In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by or in
                                   31

the right of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in which any of the present or former officers or directors of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "D&O Indemnified
Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the fact that
he or she is or was, prior to the Closing Date, a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or is or was, prior
to the Closing Date, serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at
the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, whether such
claim arises before, on or after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation (which for the
purpose of this Section 5.8 shall include any successor to the Surviving
Corporation) to, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the same extent and on
the same terms and conditions permitted in the Company's or such Company
Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other similar formation
documents in effect on the date hereof (to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable laws), each such D&O Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.  In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before,
on or after the Closing Date) with respect to which the Company or the
Surviving Corporation (or any successor of the Surviving Corporation) is
required to provide indemnification hereunder, (i) Purchaser may cause the
Surviving Corporation to, at its election, assume the defense of such matter;
provided, that in the event that the Surviving Corporation fails to assume such
defense or, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict of
interest exists between the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the D&O
Indemnified Parties on the other hand, the D&O Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the D&O Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its best efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).  If, on or after
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation is party to a reorganization,
recapitalization, merger, sale, business combination or similar transaction
after which the Surviving Corporation is unable to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 5.8(a), then from and after such time Purchaser shall
guarantee the performance by the Surviving Corporation of its obligations under
this Section 5.8(a).

                  (b)Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, for a period of six (6) years, to keep in effect in their
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other similar formation
documents a provision which provides for indemnification of the D&O Indemnified
Parties to the extent required under Section 5.8(a).

                  (c)Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain
policies of officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance")
covering the Company's existing officers and directors, which policies shall
contain terms no less favorable to the Company's current officers and directors
than the terms of the D&O Insurance currently covering the Company's existing
officers and directors, for a period of not less than six years after the
Closing Date; provided that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 5.8(c) in
                                   32
<PAGE>

excess of 300% of the aggregate premiums paid in 2004 in respect of the D&O
Insurance covering the Company's directors and officers (the "2004 Premium");
and provided further, that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
amount of insurance required by this Section 5.8(c) for such aggregate premium,
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain as much insurance as
can be obtained for an annual premium not in excess of 300% of the 2004
Premium.  Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation may purchase tail insurance
covering each Person currently covered by the Company's D&O Insurance, with
respect to matters or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Closing Date,
on coverage terms that are equivalent to the coverage terms of such D&O
Insurance in effect for the Company on the date hereof.

                  (d)This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the D&O Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and successors.  The indemnification provided for herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a D&O Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.  Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any D&O Indemnified Party
which is the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.8.

                  (e)In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effectuate the purpose of this Section 5.8, Purchaser shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to make proper provision so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.8 and none of the actions described in clauses (i) or
(ii) shall be taken until such provision is made.

            Section 5.9   Notice of Action by Written Consent

            .  In accordance with Section 228(d) of the DGCL and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, the Company shall,
after the date hereof, promptly notify holders of the Shares who did not
execute the action by written consent authorizing the execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions of
such action by written consent.

            Section 5.10  Expenses

            .  All out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Related Documents and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such out-of-pocket expenses, except as specifically provided to
the contrary in this Agreement; provided that the costs and out of pocket
expenses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries incurred in connection
with the Transactions shall be borne by the Sellers to the extent not included
in Transaction Costs.

            Section 5.11  FIRPTA Certificate

            .  At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser, in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, an affidavit of the Company, issued
pursuant to and in compliance with Treasury Regulations 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-
2(c)(3) and dated as of the Closing Date, certifying that an interest in the
                                   33
<PAGE>

Company is not a U.S. real property interest within the meaning of Section 897
of the Code.

            Section 5.12  Tax Audits

            .  For a period ending three years from the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall not, and shall not cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to, in each case directly or indirectly, seek any Tax Audit or
other review of any kind of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or
initiate any correspondence or communication with any Taxing Authority with
respect to any Tax period that ends on or before, or that includes, the Closing
Date with the objective of triggering a Tax Audit or a review of the Company's
or any Company Subsidiary's Tax position for such period.  Purchaser shall not
amend, or cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to amend, any
Tax Return for any Tax year ending on or before or including the Closing Date
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary without the prior written
consent of Sellers' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, taking into account the likelihood that the amendment to such Tax
Return may ultimately lead to a material claim being made under Section 8.2.

            Section 5.13  Appointment of Sellers' Representative.

                  (a)Each of the Sellers irrevocably appoints Fremont, as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact, to act as its representative ("Sellers'
Representative") under this Agreement and, as such, to act, as such Seller's
agent (with full power of substitution), to take such action on such Seller's
behalf with respect to all matters relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions, including without limitation, to make all determinations,
agreements and settlements relating to the working capital procedures set forth
in Section 2.8, to negotiate, defend, settle and compromise indemnification
claims, to sign receipts, consents and other documents to effect any of the
Transactions and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in connection
with the foregoing.  All decisions and actions by Sellers' Representative,
including any agreement between Sellers' Representative and Purchaser relating
to indemnification obligations of the Sellers under Article VIII, including the
defense or settlement of any claims and the making of payments with respect
hereto, shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.  Sellers'
Representative shall incur no liability to the Sellers with respect to any
action taken or suffered by the Sellers in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other documents believed by Sellers'
Representative to be genuinely and duly authorized, nor for any other action or
inaction with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Sellers under
Article VIII, including the defense or settlement of any claims and the making
of payments with respect thereto.  The Sellers' Representative may, in all
questions arising under this Agreement rely on the advice of counsel, and for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by Sellers' Representative
shall not be liable to the Sellers.  Sellers' Representative shall not have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist against
Sellers' Representative.

                  (b)Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on the instructions, decisions and acts of Sellers'
                                   34
<PAGE>

Representative required, permitted or contemplated to be taken by Sellers'
Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Agent
and Purchaser are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts
done by them in accordance with any instructions, decisions or acts of Sellers'
Representative.  Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to treat as
genuine, and as the document it purports to be, any letter, paper or other
document furnished to it by or on behalf of Sellers' Representative, and
reasonably believed by Purchaser or the Escrow Agent to be genuine and to have
been signed and presented by the proper party or parties.

                  (c)Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any
Seller, or Purchaser, or any other evidence deemed by Sellers' Representative
to be reliable, and Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to act on the
advice of counsel selected by it.  Sellers' Representative shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless
it shall have received such advice or concurrence of such Sellers as it deems
appropriate or it shall have been expressly indemnified to its satisfaction by
the Sellers appointing it severally according to their respective Ownership
Percentages against any and all liability and expense that Sellers'
Representative may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

                  (d)Each of the Sellers hereby agrees to (i) indemnify
Sellers' Representative (in its capacity as such) ratably according to their
respective Ownership Percentages against, and to hold Sellers' Representative
(in its capacity as such) harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of whatever kind which may at
any time be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against Sellers'
Representative in such capacity in any way relating to or arising out of its
action or failures to take action pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
herewith in such capacity, and (ii) pay Sellers' Representative for all costs
and expenses incurred on behalf of the Sellers ("Representative Expenses"),
promptly upon demand by Sellers' Representative, ratably according to their
respective Ownership Percentages.  The agreements in this Section 5.13 shall
survive termination of this Agreement.

            Section 5.14  Debt Financing.

                  (a)Each of Purchaser and Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Debt Financing.  As soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof but in any event prior to the Closing, Purchaser will enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with the
Commitment Letters.  Purchaser will furnish correct and complete copies of such
definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution.

                  (b)Purchaser shall keep the Company informed with respect to
all material activity concerning the status of the financings contemplated by
the Commitment Letters and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
adverse change with respect to such financings.  Without limiting the
foregoing, Purchaser agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any
Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any
financing source that is a party to any Commitment Letter notifies Purchaser or
Sub that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Purchaser on the
                                   35
<PAGE>

terms set forth therein, or (iii) for any reason Purchaser or Sub no longer
believes in good faith that Purchaser will be able to obtain all or any portion
of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on substantially the
terms described therein.  Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its
controlled Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company, (x)
take any action outside of the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or (y) enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that,
in the case of (x) or (y), would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
prevent Purchaser's obtaining of the financing contemplated by any Commitment
Letter.  Purchaser shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, any
Commitment Letter in any manner that would impair, delay or prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company.

                  (c)To the extent that any portion of the Debt Financing is
unavailable for any reason, each of Purchaser and Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain alternative financing (the "Alternative Financing") as
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
that such Alternative Financing shall be on terms and conditions no less
favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser than those provided in the Commitment
Letters, or otherwise on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser.

            Section 5.15  Assistance with Financing

            .  In addition to and without limiting the agreements of the
parties contained above or below and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company, and the Sellers agree to assist Purchaser and Sub in timely
obtaining the Debt Financing, including, without limitation, (a) delivering
such financial and statistical information and projections relating to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the Debt Financing, (b) arranging for the Company's independent
accountants, lawyers and consultants to provide such services that may be
reasonably required in respect of the Debt Financing, (c) making appropriate
officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries available for due
diligence meetings and for participation in meetings with rating agencies and
prospective lenders, (d) providing timely access to diligence materials and
appropriate personnel to allow lenders and their representatives to complete
all appropriate diligence, and (e) providing assistance with respect to the
review and granting of security interests in collateral for the Debt Financing,
and obtaining any consents associated therewith (including pre-filing of
financing statements, which is hereby authorized).  Purchaser shall promptly
reimburse the Company for any reasonable costs incurred in performing its
obligations under this Section 5.15.

            Section 5.16  Post-Closing Cooperation; Confidentiality.

                  (a)After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, the
Surviving Corporation and the Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (to the
extent within the control of such party) relating to the Surviving Corporation
(including access to books and records (in any forum or medium)) as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of SEC reports, the filing of all Tax
Returns, and making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any proceeding
related to any Tax Return.  The Sellers, the Surviving Corporation and
                                   36
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other
proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Company.

                  (b)Other than information which (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by
such Seller, (ii) is or becomes available to the Seller on a non-confidential
basis from a source other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary, provided
that such source was not known by the Seller to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to such
information, (iii) is disclosed by such Seller with the Purchaser's or the
Surviving Corporation's prior written approval or (iv) is disclosed to its
attorneys, accountants, or other Representatives so long as each such Person is
bound by a confidentiality agreement or obligation, no Seller shall make public
or otherwise communicate any confidential information or trade secrets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.  If any Seller is requested or required (by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand, any informal or formal investigation by
any government or governmental agency or authority or other supervisory
authority or otherwise) to disclose any such confidential information or trade
secret (collectively, the "Compelled Information"), such Seller will notify the
Surviving Corporation or the Purchaser promptly in writing of the terms and
circumstances surrounding such request so that it may seek a protective order
or other appropriate remedy or, in its sole discretion, waive compliance with
the terms of this Section 5.16(b).  Each Seller agrees not to oppose any action
by the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to obtain a protective order or
other appropriate remedy and shall cooperate fully with Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation in connection therewith.  If no such protective order or
other remedy is obtained, or the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation waives
compliance with the terms of this Section 5.16(b), such Seller will furnish
only that portion of the Compelled Information which such Seller is advised by
its counsel is legally required.

            Section 5.17  Covenant of Certain Individual Sellers and the
Company

.  Each of Lawrence Caldwell, Daniel Gresham, and Richard Hofmann (on behalf of
themselves and their respective spouses) (collectively, the "Section 5.17
Parties") and the Company agree to use their respective best efforts to take
the actions specified in Section 5.17 of the Disclosure Schedules.  Each of the
Section 5.17 Parties and the Company represents and warrants that each of the
filings specified in Section 5.17 has been timely and properly filed.  Each of
the Section 5.17 Parties and the Company agrees to keep Purchaser fully
informed of all material developments relating to their compliance with this
Section 5.17 and to promptly provide Purchaser with copies of all
correspondence and agreements in connection therewith.

materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect;

shall be made outside of the Indemnification Escrow Account) that result from
the failure to obtain each of such consents not previously obtained, then this
Section 6.2(d) shall not constitute a condition to the obligation of Purchaser
or Sub to consummate the Closing); and

their obligations under this Agreement and the Related Documents; provided,
however, for purposes of this Section 6.3(a) such representations and
warranties shall be construed as if they did not contain any qualification that

specifying such breach.

<PAGE>

                  (a)Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII,
each Seller severally (but not jointly) and, except with respect to Losses
resulting from indemnification obligations contained in Section 6.2(d) or
Section 5.17 Losses, to the extent of such Seller's pro rata interest in the
Indemnification Escrow Account (and, except with respect to Losses resulting
from indemnification obligations contained in Section 6.2(d) or Section 5.17
Losses, solely out of the Indemnification Escrow Account) shall indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser and its officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
representatives, agents, successors and assigns and each director of the
Company (each, a "Purchaser Indemnified Party"), from and against any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, whether incurred in connection with a Third-Party Claim or a claim
against another party hereto) ("Losses") sustained or required to be paid by
Purchaser resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made
by the Company or any Seller in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company or any Seller contained in
this Agreement, and (iii) any Section 5.17 Losses; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Company may take any
and all actions prior to the Closing that it deems necessary or appropriate to
correct or mitigate any violations or circumstances described above.  Except to
the extent that indemnification is required pursuant to Section 8.2(b), each of
the Sellers releases the Company from and against any Losses or potential
Losses resulting from such Seller's ownership of the Shares and/or Preferred
Shares, including those resulting from any proceeding, judicial or
administrative, or asserted by any other third party (any such proceeding being
referred to as a "Third-Party Claim").  For purposes of this Section 8.2(a),
the truth or correctness of any representation or warranty of the Company or
any Seller contained in this Agreement shall be determined without regard to
any "Company Material Adverse Change", "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
"materiality" qualifications set forth in such representation.

                  (b)Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, members, representatives, agents,
successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") from and against
any Loss or Losses sustained or required to be paid resulting from (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement,
(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Purchaser or Sub
contained in this Agreement.  Except to the extent that indemnification is
required pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the Company hereby releases, and Purchaser
shall cause the Company to indemnify and hold harmless, each Seller Indemnified
Party from and against any Losses or potential Losses resulting from such
indemnified party's relationship with the Company, including those resulting
from any Third-Party Claim.

                  (c)In the event that any indemnified party is entitled to
indemnification with respect to any Loss or potential Loss arising from any
Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party
prompt notice thereof. Any failure or delay on the part of the indemnified
party to give such notice shall not affect whether an indemnifying party is
liable for reimbursement except to the extent that the indemnifying party is
prejudiced thereby.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to control,
contest and defend such Third-Party Claim.  Such contest and defense shall be
conducted by counsel chosen by the indemnifying party reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified party unless the indemnifying party shall not have taken any
                                   41
<PAGE>

action to defend such Third Party Claim within 30 days after assuming the
defense, in which case and notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
8.2(c), the indemnified party shall be entitled to conduct and control the
defense thereof and the reasonable fees and disbursements of such indemnified
party's counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party. So long as
the indemnifying party is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this Section 8.2(c), the indemnified party shall be entitled,
at its own cost and expense (which expense shall not constitute a Loss), to
participate in, but not control, such contest and defense and to be represented
by attorneys of its or their own choosing, provided that the indemnified party
will cooperate with the indemnifying party in the conduct of such defense.
Neither the indemnified party nor the indemnifying party may concede, settle or
compromise any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the other party (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that
the indemnifying party may settle a Third-Party Claim if the indemnifying party
obtains a full release of all claims for which indemnification is required or
if the settlement is solely for money damages.

                  (d)If any indemnified party has a claim against any
indemnifying party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified
party shall deliver a written notice describing such claim in reasonable detail
to the indemnifying party within thirty (30) days after the discovery of the
basis for such claim.

            Section 8.3   Limitations on Indemnification.

                  (a)In connection with any indemnification claim (except with
respect to any indemnification claims arising out of Section 6.2(d) or Section
5.17 Losses) by any Person, neither the Sellers (collectively) nor Purchaser
shall be liable in an aggregate amount which, if added to all other amounts
paid as indemnification payments by such indemnifying party would exceed an
amount equal to the Indemnity Cap.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except with
respect to Losses resulting from breaches of representations or warranties made
in Section 6.2(d) or Section 5.17 Losses, no indemnifying party shall be
required to indemnify any Person for Losses resulting from a breach of
representation or warranty made in this Agreement until, and only to the
extent, the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the indemnified parties
are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceeds an
amount equal to One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the
"Deductible Amount"); provided, however, that De Minimis Losses shall not count
towards the Deductible Amount unless and until the aggregate amount of all De
Minimis Losses exceeds $1,000,000.  If at any time, the indemnified parties'
aggregate Losses (except with respect to Losses resulting from breaches of
representations or warranties made in Section 6.2(d) or Section 5.17 Losses)
for which such indemnified parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement exceed the Deductible Amount, then the indemnifying party shall
be liable only for Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; provided further
that (except with respect to indemnification obligations contained in Section
6.2(d) or Section 5.17 Losses) the obligations of the Sellers shall be
satisfied solely from the Indemnification Escrow Account, without further
recourse.

                  (b)Any Loss otherwise indemnifiable hereunder shall be
reduced by (i) any amount actually recoverable in connection therewith under
insurance or the indemnified party shall, upon receiving full payment for such
Loss from the indemnifying party, assign to the indemnifying party the right to
                                   42
<PAGE>

pursue recovery under such insurance and (ii) any Tax benefit actually realized
arising from the payment or accrual of any such indemnified amount, which
payment shall be made to the Sellers within five (5) Business Days after the
filing of the Tax Return on which such benefits are reflected.  There shall be
no indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for any punitive damages with
respect to any claims other than those incurred in connection with a Third-
Party Claim.

                  (c)If an indemnifying party makes any payment under this
Agreement in respect of any Losses, such indemnifying party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to the rights of the indemnified
party against any third party with respect to such Losses; provided, however,
that such indemnifying party shall not have any rights of subrogation with
respect to any other party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates or
their Affiliates' respective officers, directors, agents or employees. To the
extent the indemnifying party does not have rights of subrogation against any
party as a result of the proviso to the proceeding sentence, the indemnified
party will take commercially reasonable steps to collect from such third party
in respect of such Losses, and will turn over to the indemnifying party any
amounts it receives from such third party in respect of such Losses (less any
and all reasonable costs and expenses associated with such collection), to the
extent of the payment actually made by the indemnifying party in respect of
such Losses.

                  (d)The obligations set forth in this Article VIII shall
terminate upon the first anniversary of the Closing, other than with respect to
Section 5.17 Losses, which shall survive until 60 days after the applicable
statute of limitations; provided, however, that such obligations shall continue
beyond such periods with respect to any claims properly made by delivery of a
notice of such claim before the expiration of the applicable period pursuant to
this Article VIII during such periods that are not resolved at the conclusion
of such periods.

            Section 8.4   Escrow; Sole and Exclusive Remedy

            .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Sellers, collectively, shall not be liable for any Losses (except with respect
to Losses resulting from indemnification obligations contained in Section
6.2(d) or Section 5.17 Losses)  in an aggregate amount which, if added to all
other amounts paid as indemnification payments by the Sellers, would exceed the
balance of the Indemnification Escrow Account.  Furthermore, except with
respect to Losses resulting from indemnification obligations contained in
Section 6.2(d) or Section 5.17 Losses), any indemnification or payment
obligation of the Sellers for Losses under this Agreement shall be satisfied
solely by recourse to the Indemnification Escrow Account, and Purchaser shall
not seek any indemnification, contribution or repayment directly or indirectly
(through any director or officer of the Company or otherwise) from any Seller
with respect to any matter relating to the Company or the subject matter of
this Agreement (whether on the basis of a claim sounding in tort, contract,
statute or otherwise) outside of the Indemnification Escrow Account other than
with respect to (i) fraud, (ii) criminal acts committed by such Seller against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iii) transactions entered into by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary at such Seller's direction for which such
Seller or such Seller's immediate family member or Affiliate received a bribe,
kickback or similar improper benefit, (iv) any indemnification claim in
connection with Section 6.2(d) or Section 5.17 Losses or (v) loans of money or
property from the Company or any Company Subsidiary to such Seller, which loans
remain outstanding and unpaid after the Closing, provided, however, that
                                  43
<PAGE>

nothing contained herein shall preclude a party from bringing an action for
specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform
its agreements, covenants or obligations under this Agreement or for fraud.
The remaining balance of the Indemnification Escrow Account shall be released
to Sellers' Representative on the first anniversary of the Closing Date except
in respect of amounts relating to any claims for indemnification properly made
and not resolved before such time and retained therein pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
indemnification obligations arising with respect to Section 6.2(d) or Section
5.17 Losses, at Purchaser's election, any such indemnification obligation may
be satisfied by recourse to the Indemnification Escrow Account.

            Section 8.5   Contribution for Section 5.17 Losses

            .  If any amount is paid or payable by any Seller under this
Article VIII with respect to any Section 5.17 Losses, such Seller shall be
entitled to contribution from any or all of the other Sellers, so that the
respective amounts paid by each Seller with respect to such Section 5.17 Losses
are in proportion to the respective proceeds received by each Seller under this
Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 8.5 shall affect the rights of any
Purchaser Indemnified Party to seek indemnification from any Seller under this
Article VIII.
