and the Debt Fee Letters (redacted to delete the economic and &#147;market flex&#148; provisions of the Debt Fee Letters). Assuming (x)&nbsp;that the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters (other than the Parent and Merger Sub) perform their
obligations in accordance with the terms thereof and (y)&nbsp;that the conditions set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;6.2(a)</U> will be satisfied at the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall have at the Closing sufficient cash, available lines of credit or
other sources of immediately available funds to make payment of all amounts to be paid by them hereunder on and after the Closing Date. The Debt Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement
(provided that the existence or exercise of &#147;market flex&#148; provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letters shall not be deemed to constitute an amendment or modification of the Debt Commitment Letters). Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
has entered into any agreement, side letter or other commitment or arrangement relating to the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Debt Fee Letters. Assuming
(x)&nbsp;that the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters (other than the Parent and Merger Sub) perform their obligations in accordance with the terms thereof and (y)&nbsp;that the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;6.2(a) will be satisfied at the
Closing, the proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all &#147;market flex&#148; provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letters), together with cash, available lines of credit or other sources of
immediately available funds, will be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the aggregate cash to be paid as Merger Consideration and the aggregate Company Accelerated Equity Award Payments to which
holders of Shares and Company Accelerated Equity Awards will be entitled pursuant to this Agreement and the repayment of the indebtedness contemplated by <U>Sections 5.17(a)</U> and <U>5.17(b)</U>. As of the date hereof, the commitments contained in
the Debt Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and represent a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, subject only to (i)&nbsp;the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and (ii)&nbsp;the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of creditors. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection
with the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default that could reasonably be expected to result in a failure to satisfy a Financing Condition on the part of Parent
or a breach or default by any other party thereto under any term of the Debt Commitment Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than the Financing
Conditions. Assuming the condition set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;6.2(a)</U> regarding the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and the condition set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;6.2(b)</U> regarding the Company&#146;s
performance and compliance with all covenants and obligations under this Agreement required to be performed and complied with by it are satisfied on the Closing Date, Parent has no reason to believe that (i)&nbsp;any of the Financing Conditions will
not be satisfied or (ii)&nbsp;the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. </P>
