will, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the

of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,

bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have
been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and

attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (subject to such changes as may be mutually

Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to

receive, pursuant to _Section 2.6_, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Shares, if any, which would otherwise be issuable in respect of such
Company Common Stock pursuant to this  _Section 2.1(a_) (the " _Fractional

to _Section 2.3(f)_.

 



-3- (b) _Conversion of Company Preferred Stock_. Each Share of Company Preferred

than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ and other
than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed converted into shares of Company Common

such Shares of Company Common Stock will be automatically converted into the
right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof in accordance with,
and subject to, the terms, conditions and procedures set forth in this
_Article II_ (including the proration procedures in _Section 2.2(d)_), the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_, in the case of each
such election, payable to the holder upon surrender of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share formerly representing such Share in accordance with _Section
2.2_ and _Section 2.3_. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each

Consideration, together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(f)_.

made with respect thereto.

(d) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and
become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the preceding
sentence.

 

2.2 _Election and Proration Procedures._

 

(a) Parent shall prepare and file an election form in such form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (which form shall include the
items described in clause (i) and (ii) of _Section 2.3(b)_) (the " _Election
Form_ ") as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. Parent shall direct and
cause the Exchange Agent to mail the Election Form with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to all persons who are record holders of the Shares as of
the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting (the " _Mailing Date_ ").
Each Election Form shall permit a record holder of Shares (or the beneficial
owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to
specify (x) the number of such holders Shares with respect to which such
holder makes a Mixed Election (each such share, a " _Mixed Election
Share_"), (y) the number of such holders Shares with respect to which such
holder makes a Cash Election (each such share, a " _Cash Election Share_ ")
and (z) the number of such holders Shares with respect to which such holder
makes a Stock Election (each such share, a " _Stock Election Share_ ").

 

(b) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Shares between the record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the
Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

 



-4- (c) Any Shares with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an
effective, properly completed Election Form (including duly executed
transmittal materials included with the Election Form) on or before 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on the date that is one Business Day immediately preceding the
Company Stockholder Meeting (or such other time and date as Parent and the
Company shall agree in writing) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") (other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ and other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed to be " _No Election Shares_," and the
holders of such No Election Shares shall be deemed to have made a Mixed
Election with respect to such No Election Shares. An Election Form shall be
effective and properly made and completed if the Exchange Agent shall have
actually received at its designated office by the Election Deadline, an
Election Form (including duly executed transmittal materials included with the
Election Form) properly completed and signed and accompanied by (i)
Certificates representing the Shares to which such Election Form relates, duly
endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of
the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates
as set forth in such Election Form from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor
institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ ,
that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the
time set forth in such guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the documents required by the procedures set forth in the
Election Form. The Election Form shall specify that delivery shall be made,
and risk of loss and title to any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Election Form
together with any Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares representing such
Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Election Deadline (and in
any event two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to effect the following prorations to the Merger Consideration
allocations; _provided_ that the payment of the Merger Consideration shall be
made in accordance with _Section 2.3_: 

i. If the Cash Election Amount is greater than the Available Cash Election
Amount, then each Cash Election Share shall, instead of being converted into
the Cash Election Consideration, be converted into the right to receive (A) an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election
Consideration, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (B) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares equal to
the product of the Stock Election Consideration, multiplied by a fraction
equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

ii. If the Available Cash Election Amount is greater than the Cash Election
Amount, then each Stock Election Share shall, instead of being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration, be converted into the
right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount
of such excess divided by the number of Stock Election Shares and (B) a number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares equal to the
product of the Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Election
Consideration minus (II) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this
paragraph, and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Consideration.

(e) Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the authorized Person
properly submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form
is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the Shares represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares, except to the extent
a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of Shares
prior to the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

 



-5- 2.3 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent will designate a
reputable bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as the paying and exchange agent for the purpose of effecting the payment and
delivery of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the
holders of Shares for the purposes of (i) mailing and receiving Election Forms
and determining, in accordance with this _Article II_ , the form of Merger
Consideration to be received by each holder of Shares, and (ii) receiving and
holding their Election Forms and certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") and non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") and shall obtain no rights or interests in the Shares
represented thereby. At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of
Parent Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ in
book-entry form equal to the aggregate number of Parent Shares to be issued as
Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration) and (ii)
cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate cash to be paid as Merger Consideration, the aggregate Company
Accelerated Equity Award Payments (except to the extent that any such Equity
Award Payments are to be made through the payroll of the Surviving
Corporation), any Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under
_Section 2.3(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry Parent Shares and cash amounts,
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the
" _Exchange Fund_ ") in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of the
Shares converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ and
Company Accelerated Equity Awards. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the Company
Accelerated Equity Award Payments and the dividends under _Section 2.3(f)_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be promptly deposited, additional
Parent Shares or cash with the Exchange Agent in the amount required to make
such payments. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange
Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of
the Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts payable in respect of
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with
_Section 2.3(f)_, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with
this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this _Article II_ and to the extent of any such loss, Parent shall
fund additional cash amounts into the Exchange Fund to enable such payments
to be made. Any interest or other income from such investments shall be paid
promptly to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event, within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent will cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_
(other than the holders of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
have properly completed and submitted, and have not revoked, an Election Form
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ prior to the Closing): (i) a letter of transmittal,
which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates (if any) will pass, only upon delivery of
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent, and will otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions in
customary form for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration or any dividends
or other distributions on the Parent Shares

 



-6-  in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_. Upon surrender of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, and upon delivery of an Election Form or letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ , including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration or any dividends
or other distributions on the Parent Shares in accordance with _Section
2.3(f)_, for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and for each Book-Entry Share. Any
Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. All Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration or other amounts due pursuant to
_Section 2.3(f)_, paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares will be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition
precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person
requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or similar Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will have
established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not payable. Any other transfer or similar Taxes
incurred in connection with the Merger will be paid by Parent. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
(other than Shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_) will be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or the amount determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_, as
applicable, without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were
previously outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of _Section 2.3(b)_) they
will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it
any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest accrued with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
Company Accelerated Equity Awards, and thereafter such holders will be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration or any dividends or other distributions on
the Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_, payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or Company Accelerated
Equity Awards and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.3(b)_, without
interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent will be liable to any holder
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



-7- (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_ or
_(b)_ hereof, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration or any dividends or other distributions on the Parent Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may,
in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to any such payment,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
customary affidavit of loss which includes an indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to Parent Shares issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by
Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
the Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such Parent Shares.

(g)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. Except
for any deduction or withholding with respect to Company Accelerated Equity
Award Payments or any U.S. federal backup withholding attributable to a
failure of a holder of Shares to provide a completed IRS Form W-8 or W-9,
before making any such deduction or withholding, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to give the Company prior notice of its intention to make
such deduction or withholding, and such notice shall include the authority,
basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and notwithstanding any failure to
comply with the preceding sentence, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder of record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) who is entitled to demand and has
properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and will instead represent only the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due in respect of such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to

 



-8-  Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to receive such payment in
respect of such Dissenting Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares will
be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and will be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Mixed Election
Consideration, or other amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_, without
interest. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments submitted pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting
Shares, and Parent will have the right to control all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent in its sole
discretion, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer
to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

2.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Company Equity Plans_.

(a) _Vesting Acceleration_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and take
all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the vesting, and, if applicable, exercisability
of each (i) outstanding Share subject to a right of repurchase in favor of
the Company or risk of forfeiture (collectively, " _Company Restricted Shares_
"), (ii) restricted stock unit granted in respect of Shares that is not a
Company Assumed Restricted Stock Unit (collectively, " _Company Accelerated
Restricted Stock Units_ "), (iii) performance stock unit granted in respect of
Shares that is not a Company Assumed Performance Stock Unit (collectively, "
_Company Accelerated Performance Stock Units_ "), (iv) phantom stock right in
respect of or economically linked to Shares (collectively, " _Company Phantom
Awards_ "), (v) option to purchase Shares (collectively, " _Company Options_
"), (vi) stock appreciation right in respect of Shares (collectively, "
_Company Stock Appreciation Rights_ ") and (vii) any other equity or equity-
based award in respect of, linked to or denominated in Shares other than
the Company Assumed Restricted Stock Units and Company Assumed Performance
Stock Units (collectively with Company Restricted Shares, Company Accelerated
Restricted Stock Units, Company Accelerated Performance Stock Units, Company
Phantom Awards, Company Options and Company Stock Appreciation Rights, "
_Company Accelerated Equity Awards_ ") whether granted separately or under any
employee or director stock option, stock purchase or equity compensation plan,
arrangement or agreement of the Company, including the Companys Amended and
Restated 2009 Stock Option Plan, the Companys Stock Appreciation Rights Plan,
the Companys Amended and Restated Phantom Stock Plan, the Companys Amended
and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Companys Amended and Restated
Restricted Stock Plan (collectively, " _Company Equity Plans_ "), will
accelerate with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of the Shares underlying
such Company Accelerated Equity Award (treating for this purpose any
performance-based vesting condition as having been attained at "target") and
all restrictions thereon shall lapse. After giving effect to such accelerated
vesting, the Company Accelerated Equity Awards shall be treated in accordance
with _Section 2.5(b)_ or, in the case of Company Restricted Shares, _Section
2.1_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Accelerated Equity Awards_. Effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Accelerated Equity
Award, other than the Company Restricted Shares which shall be subject to
_Section 2.1_, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such cancelled Company Accelerated Equity Award will be entitled
to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Accelerated
Equity Award and in full settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount
equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
Accelerated Equity Award as of immediately prior to such cancellation and (B)
any positive difference obtained by subtracting any exercise price per Share
applicable to such Company Accelerated Equity Award (if applicable) from the
Equity Award Consideration (such amounts payable

 



-9-  hereunder being referred to as the " _Company Accelerated Equity Award
Payments_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Company Accelerated
Equity Award that does not have an exercise price, the exercise price per
Share for the purposes of the preceding sentence shall be zero. From and after
the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Accelerated Equity Awards will
no longer be outstanding or exercisable by the former holder thereof, but
will only entitle such holder to the payment of the Company Accelerated Equity
Award Payment.

(c) _Payments through Payroll_. Any Company Accelerated Equity Award Payment
to which an employee or former employee of the Company becomes entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ shall be made through the Surviving
Corporations payroll no more than ten (10) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

(d) _Equity Award Rollover_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and take
all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that each (i)
restricted stock unit granted after February 28, 2017 under the Companys
Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan in respect of Shares and held
by a Continuing Employee (the " _Company Assumed Restricted Stock Units_ ,"
collectively with the Company Accelerated Restricted Stock Units, the "
_Company Restricted Stock Units_ ") that is outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time, will be converted as of the Effective Time into a
restricted stock unit (the " _Assumed Restricted Stock Unit_ ") on the same
terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements but subject
to such accelerated vesting, if any, provided to the holder thereof in a plan
set forth on _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules or a
Company Employee Agreement) under the Companys Amended and Restated Long-
Term Incentive Plan and award agreement evidencing such Company Assumed
Restricted Stock Unit, in respect of the number of Parent Shares that is equal
to the number of Shares subject to the Company Assumed Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Assumed Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share); and (ii) performance
stock unit granted after February 28, 2017 under the Companys Amended and
Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan in respect of Shares and held by a
Continuing Employee (collectively, " _Company Assumed Performance Stock Units_
," collectively with the Company Accelerated Performance Stock Units, the "
_Company Performance Stock Units_ ") that is outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time, will be converted as of the Effective Time into a
restricted stock unit (the " _Assumed Performance Stock Units_ ") in
accordance with the terms of the Companys Amended and Restated Long-Term
Incentive Plan and award agreement evidencing such Company Assumed Performance
Stock Unit (with vesting to occur in substantially equal installments on each
of the first three anniversaries of the original date of grant of the related
Company Assumed Performance Stock Units, subject to such accelerated vesting,
if any, provided to the holder thereof in a plan set forth on  _Section
5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules or a Company Employee Agreement)
in respect of the number of Parent Shares that is equal to the number of
Shares that would have vested at the end of the performance period if
target performance had been achieved immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Assumed Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest
whole share). For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Assumed Equity Award
Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient of (x) the Equity Award Consideration
and (ii) the Parent Share VWAP. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall
file, and keep effective for so long as the Assumed Restricted Stock Units and
Assumed Performance Stock Units are outstanding, a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the
Parent Shares subject to Assumed Restricted Stock Units and Assumed
Performance Stock Units converted pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)_.

(e) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Equity Plans, except the Companys Amended and Restated Long-Term
Incentive Plan, will be terminated, and no further Company Accelerated Equity
Awards or other rights with respect to Shares will be granted thereunder.

 



-10- (f) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. The Company shall take such action as may be
necessary to: (i) terminate the then-current offering period under the
Company ESPP as of a date that is as soon as practicable following the date
hereof and in no event later than immediately preceding the next scheduled
purchase date under the terms of the Company ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Ending
Date_ ") and (ii) terminate the Company ESPP as of the Effective Time. On the
Company ESPP Ending Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company
ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each
participant under the Company ESPP shall be refunded to the participant in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP for refunded contributions.

 

(g) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.5_. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
to any Person any Shares or other Equity Interests of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Company Accelerated Equity Awards or other rights with respect to Shares.

2.6 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing fractional
Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Shares
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating all shares
represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a Parent
Share (rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
multiplied by the Parent Share VWAP.

and other information incorporated by reference therein, but excluding any
disclosure contained in such Parent SEC Documents under the heading "Risk
Factors", "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" or similar
heading and other disclosures that

 



-31-  are similarly predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature);

hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or, where relevant, in good

Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Parent has made available to the Company accurate and complete copies of
the currently effective Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent and

which Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary is a party, except, with
respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any such conflicts, violations, consents,
breaches, losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens which would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this agreement, or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the

a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.6  _SEC Filings; Financial Statements._

(a) Since January 1, 2015, Parent has timely filed or otherwise furnished (as
applicable) all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports,
certifications, statements and other documents required to be filed or
furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, together with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (such documents and any other documents filed by Parent with the SEC,
including any publicly filed supplements, modifications or amendments,
collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
effective dates (in the case of the Parent SEC Documents that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of
their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Parent
SEC Documents), or in each case, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of
the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents (i) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which such statement
were made, not misleading. All of the audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Parent
and its consolidated Parent Subsidiaries included in the Parent SEC Documents,
including the related notes and schedules (collectively, the " _Parent
Financial Statements_ "), (A) have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be expressly indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of interim
financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments
which are not expected to be material individually or in the aggregate), (B)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity of Parent and the consolidated Parent Subsidiaries as of
the dates and for the periods referred to therein (except as may be expressly
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial
statements, for normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not
expected to be material individually or in the aggregate) and (C) complied as
to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto
in effect at the time of such filing.

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in its published
financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

 



-34- (c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 4.6(a)_, (i) Ernst and Young
LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure, (ii) since January 1, 2015, none of the
Parent nor, to the knowledge of the Parent, any director of officer of the
Parent, has formally received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Parent or its internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, (iii)
no executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect to make, without
qualification, the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any form, report or schedule
filed by Parent with the SEC since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
(iv) no enforcement action has been initiated or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent by the SEC relating to disclosures contained in any
Parent SEC Document.

4.7 _Internal Controls_. Parent maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and
reasonably sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (a) transactions
are executed only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations, (b) access to assets of Parent is permitted only in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization and (c) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The
Parents internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Parents
consolidated financial reporting and the preparation of the Parent
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Parent has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)

reasonable assurance that all material information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure to enable the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Parent to make the required
certifications under the Exchange Act with respect to such report. Neither
the Parent, the audit committee of the Parent Board, nor, to the knowledge of
Parent, the Parent auditors, is aware of or has received notification of (A)
any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting of the Parent or (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over
financial reporting. Parent has not made, or been required to make, any such
disclosures to Parents auditors.

4.8 _Compliance With Law_. 

(a) Except where such non-compliance would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect: (i) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary is in compliance and since
January 1, 2015 has been in compliance with all Laws and Orders applicable to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any assets owned or used by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, and (ii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
received any written communication since January 1, 2015 from a Governmental
Entity that alleges that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is not in compliance
with any such Law or Order.

 

(b) Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, since January
1, 2015, none of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries, or, to Parents knowledge,
any Representatives acting on their behalf, have, directly or indirectly,
corruptly offered, promised, paid, authorized or given money or anything of
value to any Government Official, for the purpose of: (i) influencing any act
or decision of

 



-35-  any Government Official; (ii) inducing any Government Official to do or omit
to do an act in violation of a lawful duty; (iii) securing any improper
business advantage; (iv) inducing any Government Official to influence the
act or decision of a Governmental Entity; or (v) for any other corrupt,
improper, or illegal purpose, each in order to obtain or retain business for
Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries in violation of applicable Anti-Corruption
Laws.

4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since April 1, 2017 until the
date of this Agreement, there has not occurred, arisen or come into existence
any fact, change, event, development or circumstance, or any worsening
thereof, which would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.10 _Litigation_.

(a) There is no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or Merger Sub that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding Order that
would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.11 _Information Supplied_. The information expressly supplied in writing by
Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will not (a) in the case of the Registration
Statement, at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective under
the Securities Act, and (b) in the case of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as
of the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the stockholders
of the Company and at the time of any meeting of the Companys stockholders to

Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Parent
and Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to statements
made in any of the foregoing documents based on information supplied by the
Company for inclusion therein.

respect to any irregularity, misstatement, significant overpayment, or
violation of law arising under or relating to any Material Current Parent
Government Contract.

 



-36- 4.13 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns (beneficially or otherwise) any Shares or other Equity
Interests in the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire
Company Common Stock or other Equity Interests in the Company (or any other
economic interest through derivative securities or otherwise in the Company).
Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective "affiliates" or
"associates" (as each term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) is, or at
any time during the past three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of
the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

4.14 _No Required Vote_. No vote of the holders of any Equity Interest in
Parent is required for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

4.15 _Financial Capability_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and
complete copy of each of the executed Debt Commitment Letters, and the Debt
Fee Letters (redacted to delete the economic and "market flex" provisions of
the Debt Fee Letters). Assuming (x) that the parties to the Debt Commitment
Letters (other than the Parent and Merger Sub) perform their obligations in
accordance with the terms thereof and (y) that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ will be satisfied at the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub
shall have at the Closing sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other
sources of immediately available funds to make payment of all amounts to be
paid by them hereunder on and after the Closing Date. The Debt Commitment
Letters have not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of
this Agreement (provided that the existence or exercise of "market flex"
provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letters shall not be deemed to constitute
an amendment or modification of the Debt Commitment Letters). Neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or
other commitment or arrangement relating to the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters and the Debt Fee Letters. Assuming (x) that the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letters (other than the Parent and Merger Sub) perform their
obligations in accordance with the terms thereof and (y) that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.2(a) will be satisfied at the Closing, the proceeds of
the Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any
or all "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letters), together
with cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds, will be sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the payment of the aggregate cash to be paid as
Merger Consideration and the aggregate Company Accelerated Equity Award
Payments to which holders of Shares and Company Accelerated Equity Awards
will be entitled pursuant to this Agreement and the repayment of the
indebtedness contemplated by _Sections 5.17(a)_ and _5.17(b)_. As of the date
hereof, the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have not
been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Debt
Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and represent a valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each
other party thereto, subject only to (i) the satisfaction or waiver of the
Financing Conditions and (ii) the qualification that such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general
application relating to or affecting rights of creditors. Parent has fully
paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that
are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default
that could reasonably be expected to result in a failure to satisfy a
Financing Condition on the part of Parent or a breach or default by any other
party thereto under any term of the Debt Commitment Letters. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing, other than the Financing Conditions. Assuming
the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ regarding the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and the condition set
forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ regarding the Companys performance and compliance
with all covenants and obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed and complied with by it are satisfied on the Closing Date, Parent
has no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be
satisfied or (ii) the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on
the Closing Date.

 



-37-  Parent understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement,
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are not in
any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to the consummation by Parent or
Merger Sub of any financing arrangements, the obtaining by Parent or Merger
Sub of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any
financing to Parent or Merger Sub.

 

4.16 _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_.

 

(a) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its
incorporation or organization and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Closing Date have
incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or affiliate, any
obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type
or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person.

4.17 _Management Arrangements_. As of the date hereof, other than the Support
Agreement and except as previously disclosed to the Company, none of Parent or
Merger Sub, or their respective executive officers, directors or affiliates,
has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of
the executive officers, directors or Affiliates of the Company that is
currently in effect or would become effective in the future (upon consummation
of the Merger or otherwise) and that would be required to be disclosed under
Item 1005(d) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act.

4.18 _Brokers_. Except for Parents obligations to Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC
and Perella Weinberg Partners LP, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees or affiliates, has
incurred or will incur on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Subsidiary, any brokerage, finders, financial advisory or similar fee in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.19 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in _Article 3_ , Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
that neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes, and Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge that they have not relied upon or otherwise been
induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

terms and the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, (i) the

party, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited, initiated,
encouraged, facilitated or otherwise obtained in breach, in any material

determines in good faith that the failure to take such actions would

until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, neither the Company Board nor any committee

Days of such commencement or (vii) announce its intention, authorize, commit,
resolve or agree to take any such foregoing actions (each such action set

if (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
a third party that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged, facilitated or
otherwise obtained in breach, in any material respect, of the provisions of
this Agreement and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after

constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that have been proposed to the
Company by Parent in writing during the Notice Period provided pursuant to
this _Section 5.4(e)_ and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that a failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation and/or
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to
violate the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law, then, prior to the time (but not after) the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may take the
following actions: (y) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to
such Superior Proposal or (z) terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement

until the Company complies with the requirements of _Section 7.1(d)_ and
pays the Breakup Fee in accordance with _Section 7.2(b)_; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of
Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) unless:

 

i. the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four (4)
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
will not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice will specify the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and the Company has contemporaneously provided
a copy of all material documents related to such Superior Proposal, including
the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such
Superior Proposal, including any definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal and any related financing commitments; and

 

ii. the Company has, and has caused the Company Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the
price, financing or other material terms of the Superior Proposal, the
Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.4(e)_ with respect to such
new written notice;  _provided_ that references to the four (4) Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a three (3) Business Day
period.

 



-45- (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
time (but not after) the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, solely in
response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may make a Change of Board
Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any Change of Board Recommendation proposed to be
made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.4(e)_) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that, in light of an Intervening Event and
taking into account the results of any negotiations with Parent as
contemplated by subsection (ii) below and any offer from Parent contemplated
by subsection (iii) below, that the failure to make a Change of Board
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties
owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change
of Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

i. the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_
"), of the Companys intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it
being understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall (A) specify in detail the
Company Boards reason for proposing to effect such Change of Board
Recommendation (including a description of such Intervening Event in
reasonable detail) and (B) include all material documentation related to the
Intervening Event;

 

ii. prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Intervening Event
Notice Period negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company
Board to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

iii. Parent shall not have, within the Intervening Event Notice Period,
proposed in writing to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a
manner that the Company Board has in good faith determined (after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Change of Board
Recommendation.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company (i) from
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that the Company
Board determines to make in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
outside counsel) in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties under, or in order
to otherwise comply with, applicable Law, in each case, so long as any such
disclosure (A) includes the Company Board Recommendation, without any
modification thereof and (B) does not contain a Change of Board
Recommendation; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that no Change of Board
Recommendation may be made except in accordance with the terms of _Section
5.4(e)_ and _Section 5.4(f)_.

 



-46- 5.5 _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Stockholder
Approval_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC
the Registration Statement, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Each of Parent and the Company will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, when filed, to comply in all material respects with all
legal requirements applicable thereto, (ii) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff
concerning the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
(iii) have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and (iv) keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to complete the
Merger. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or response to SEC comments with
respect thereto, will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without
the others prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act (but in no event earlier than the record date set by
the Company for the Company Stockholder Meeting). Parent or the Company, as
applicable, will promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and will, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies
of all material correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus received from
the SEC and advise the other on any oral comments with respect to the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus received from the
SEC. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent and the Company will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent and the Company
will also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or Blue Sky
Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger,
and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Shares as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with any such actions. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any
of such documents would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto
and each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the Company stockholders.

(b) The Company shall duly call, establish a record date for, give notice of
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ")
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act for the purpose of voting on the adoption
of this Agreement. The Company shall not, without the consent of Parent,
adjourn or postpone, cancel, recess or reschedule, the Company Stockholder
Meeting; _provided_ , that the Company may, without the consent of (but
after consultation with) Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting (A) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is

 



-47-  originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there
are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, (B) if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law or for the distribution of any required supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or (C) to solicit additional
proxies if the Company reasonably determines that it is advisable or necessary

decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that
would adversely affect the ability of any party hereto to consummate the

foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to,
and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, offer, negotiate, commit to, take or effect any
Divestiture Action, if doing so would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, results of operations or financial condition of (x) Parent or its
Subsidiaries or (y) the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (in each case
of (x) and (y), as measured on a scale relative to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.6_, each party hereto will: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding by
or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties

Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as
may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any applicable Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding, each
party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to

 



-49-  such request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding and to have access to and
be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation or Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
party agrees that, with respect to the Competition Laws of the jurisdictions
set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall,
acting reasonably and in good faith, on behalf of the parties, direct and
control all communications and strategy relating to (x) obtaining any
consents, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained

Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, each party hereto will promptly notify the other party hereto of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Person
alleging that the consent, approval, permission or waiver from such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (c)
the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
which would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations
of any party to effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ will not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

5.8 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees
that no public release or announcement (including, without limitation,
internal written non-privileged announcements or internal scripts for oral
non-privileged announcements, in each case, that are broadly distributed or
broadly made available to the general employee population of the Company
regarding the Merger between the date of this Agreement and the Closing)
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby will be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as
such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or Governmental
Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to review and
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (and
incorporate all such comments reasonably proposed). The Company, Parent and
Merger Sub agree that the press release announcing the execution and delivery
of this Agreement will be a joint release of, and will not be issued prior to
the approval of each of, the Company and Parent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties may, without the prior consent of the other party,
reasonably disseminate information previously included in a press release or
other public disclosure made pursuant to this _Section 5.8_.

 



-50- 5.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time or such longer time
as required by applicable Laws, Parent will provide, or will cause to be
provided, to those employees of the Company who continue to be employed by
Parent and Parent Subsidiaries (individually, " _Continuing Employee_ " and
collectively, " _Continuing Employees_ ") who is not covered by a Company CBA
(collectively, the " _Non-Union Continuing Employees_ ") (i) cash
compensation, including base salary rate (but not including non-statutory
overtime compensation), commission and target bonus opportunity on terms at
least as favorable in the aggregate as the total cash compensation
opportunities provided to the Non-Union Continuing Employee by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if greater, on terms required by
applicable Laws, and (ii) benefits (other than severance, which is governed
by the covenant in _Section 5.9(d)_, and any equity compensation) on terms
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided to the Non-
Union Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The employment terms and conditions of each Company Employee whose
employment is covered by a Company CBA shall be governed by the applicable
Company CBA.

 

(b) As of and following the Effective Time, Parent will either (i) continue
Company Benefit Plans with respect to Continuing Employees, (ii) permit
Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to
participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including
without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, or personal time off plans or
programs) of Parent, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii). To the
extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program or
policies following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in
which Continuing Employees are entitled to participate to treat, the service
of Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its predecessors to the
extent previously recognized by the Company as of the date hereof attributable
to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits including the
applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but excluding
benefit accrual (including minimum pension amount), equity incentive plans and
eligibility for early retirement under any benefit plan of Parent or
eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans or as would otherwise result in
a duplication of benefits. Without limiting the foregoing: (i) Parent shall
cause any pre-existing conditions or actively at work or similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or required
physical examinations under any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived
with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents; _provided_
, _however_ , that with respect to preexisting conditions, such conditions
shall be waived to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which
Continuing Employees participated immediately prior to the date Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents are transitioned to Parents health or
similar plans and (ii) in the event Continuing Employees are placed onto
Parents paid time off or vacation policy, program, plan or arrangement,
Parent shall continue to recognize any paid time off balance theretofore
accrued with the Company or, in lieu of such recognition, make a cash payment
to Continuing Employees in an amount equal to any such accrued paid time off
forfeited. Parent shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
deductibles paid by Continuing Employees under any of the Companys health
plans in the plan year in which Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents are transitioned to Parents health or similar plans to be credited
towards deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent.

 

(c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time or such longer time
as required by applicable Laws, Parent will provide, or will cause to be
provided severance in accordance with the Companys severance plans as set
forth in _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or, if higher,
in accordance with local laws outside of the United States.

 

(d) For the terms of the agreements or arrangements, Parent shall assume and
cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to honor, in
accordance with their terms, the severance and change in control agreements
and retention arrangements that are listed on _Section 5.9(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Employee Agreements_ "). 

 



-51- (e) Parent shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates, to pay, to the extent
not already paid prior to the Closing, bonuses to (i) employees of the
Company as of immediately prior to the Closing who are participants of the
Companys Short-Term Incentive Plan, known as the "AIP," in respect of
calendar year 2017 (" _2017 AIP Bonuses_ ") and (ii) employees of the Company
as of immediately prior to the Closing who are participants of the Companys
Performance Bonus Program, known as the "PBP," in respect of calendar year
2017 (" _2017 PBP Bonuses_ "), such participants and their allocations of
2017 AIP Bonuses and 2017 PBP Bonuses, as applicable, to be determined by the
Company and memorialized on a schedule to be provided to Parent no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. The 2017
AIP Bonuses and 2017 PBP Bonuses shall be payable in two installments, as
follows: (x) 75% of the actual 2017 AIP Bonus or actual 2017 PBP Bonus amount
to which such employee would be entitled for the full calendar year under the
terms of the applicable plan based on actual performance (as determined by the
Company prior to the Closing) for the period beginning January 1, 2017 and
ending September 30, 2017, up to an amount equal to 75% of such employees
target 2017 AIP Bonus amount or target 2017 PBP Bonus amount, as applicable,
which amount shall be paid to such employee following the occurrence of the
Closing, through the Surviving Corporations payroll no more than ten (10)
Business Days following the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such payment
amount will be pro-rated to take into account any such employees partial year
of employment; and (y) an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (A)
the actual 2017 AIP Bonus or actual 2017 PBP Bonus amount to which such
employee would be entitled under the terms of the applicable plan for the full
performance period based on actual performance during such period (evaluated
and determined in accordance with the Companys past practices prior to the
Closing) and (B) the amount paid to such employee pursuant to subclause (x)
above, with such second installment amount payable at the time that the 2017
AIP Bonuses or 2017 PBP Bonuses would normally be paid by the Company (but no
later than March 15, 2018). Payments set forth in this _Section 5.9(e)_ shall
be subject to each employees continued employment through the date the final
2017 AIP Bonus or 2017 PBP Bonus is paid (unless otherwise provided in a
Company Employee Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
employees employment is terminated by Parent or any of its affiliates
without cause following the Closing but prior to payment of such 2017 AIP
Bonus or 2017 PBP Bonus, as applicable, such employee will continue to be
eligible to receive any 2017 AIP Bonus or 2017 PBP Bonus to which such
employee would have otherwise have been entitled, payable at same time the
bonuses are paid to other employees.

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates, to, to the extent not
already paid prior to the Closing, pay bonuses to employees of the Company as
of immediately prior to the Closing who participate in the Companys 2017
Client Account Management Sales Incentive Plan, known as the "CAM" in respect
of calendar year 2017 (" _2017 CAM Bonuses_ ") in an amount based on
individual achievement under the terms of the 2017 CAM, as applicable to each
such employee in the normal course under the terms of the 2017 CAM program.
The 2017 CAM Bonuses shall be paid by Parent or one of its affiliates at the
time that the 2017 CAM Bonuses would normally be paid by the Company (but no
later than March 15, 2018), subject to the employees continued employment
with the Parent or its affiliates until the date of payment; _provided_ , that
in the event of the termination of the employment of the employee entitled to
receive such 2017 CAM Bonus by Parent or any of its affiliates without cause
following the Closing but prior to payment of such 2017 CAM Bonus, such
employee shall continue to be eligible to receive the 2017 CAM Bonus to which
the employee would have otherwise have been entitled, payable at same
time the 2017 CAM Bonuses are paid to other employees.

(g) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
affiliates to, be bound by, and to comply with the terms of the Company CBAs
as ratified and in effect on the Closing until Parent or its affiliates
negotiate a new collective agreement. Notwithstanding anything to 

 



-52-  the contrary in this _Section 5.9_, Parent further agrees that the
provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall be subject to any applicable
provisions of the Company CBA in respect of Continuing Employees, to the
extent such provisions are inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the
provisions of any such Company CBA.

 

(h) To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program or
policies following the Effective Time, as soon as practicable following the
Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, cause the Code
Section 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in which the
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to accept rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from under the Companys 401(k) Plan (the "
_401(k) Plan_ "), including the amount of any unpaid balance of any
participant loan made under the 401(k) Plan provided that such rollover must
be made in all cash. With respect to the calendar year quarter during which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates
to, make matching employer contributions consistent with the Companys past
practice under the 401(k) Plan to each 401(k) Plan participant within 15
Business Days following the calendar year quarter end.

 

(i) To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program or
policies following the Effective Time, following the Closing, the Code Section
125 flexible spending plan maintained or to be established by Parent or one of
its Affiliates (the " _Parent 125 Plan_ ") shall credit each Continuing
Employees flexible spending account with the balance recognized by the
Company immediately prior to Closing. Each Continuing Employee eligible to
participate in the Parent 125 Plan shall be permitted to continue his or her
election in effect under the flexible spending account maintained by an
Acquired Company for the remainder of the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs, subject to the limitation on contributions contained in the
related Company Benefit Plan, and Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, honor any such election, and the Parent 125 Plan shall honor any claims
incurred by a Continuing Employee during such calendar year that would
otherwise be an eligible expense under the related Company Benefit Plan,
whether or not such expense was incurred before, on or after the Closing Date.

(j) With respect to any Continuing Employees based outside of the United
States, Parents obligations under this _Section 5.9_ shall be modified to
the extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries
and political subdivisions thereof in which such Continuing Employees are
based.

(k) Nothing in this Agreement will require the continued employment of any
Person, and except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.9_ and as set
forth on _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no provision of
this Agreement will (i) prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or
benefit plans of any Parent or Parent Subsidiaries or (ii) be construed as to
establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program or
agreement including any Company Benefit Plan and Foreign Benefit Plan.

(l) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 5.9_ with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties and will not create any right in any other
Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any
Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof. 

 



-53- 5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company to the same extent such Persons
are required to be indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with
any directors and officers of the Company and made available to Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement, in each case arising out of acts or omissions
in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger). Parent and the Surviving Corporation will advance
as incurred expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) to all
past and present directors and officers of the Company incurred in
the defense of any Proceedings with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.10(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements in
existence on the date of this Agreement and made available to Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement, subject to the Surviving Companys receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such expenses if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 5.10(a)_. In the event of any Proceeding pursuant
to which any person may claim indemnification pursuant to this _Section
5.10_, (i) the Surviving Corporation may control the defense of any such
Proceeding (other than in respect of any Proceeding that seeks non-monetary
relief or involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations) and (ii) no Person
who may claim indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ may settle,
compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Proceeding
without the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors
and officers of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than
are currently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will cause the indemnification agreements in
existence on the date of this Agreement and made available to Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement with any of the directors or officers of the
Company to continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
following the Effective Time.

 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors
and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time,
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (accurate and complete copies
which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
will not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement
(which annual premium is hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be
as set forth in _Section 5.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence will be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by either Parent or the
Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
will not obtain any such prepaid policy if the cost of such policy will exceed
300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. If
such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full force
and effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



-54- (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.10_ will (i) continue,
notwithstanding any six-year limitation referred to above, until the final
disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought or
commenced during such six-year period and (ii) not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this  _Section
5.10_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies
will be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_).

 

5.11 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"business combination" or other anti-takeover Laws becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Merger, including the
acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Support Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board will, as
promptly as practicable, take all action necessary to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.12  _Parent Agreement Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent agrees to cause Merger
Sub to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

5.13  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board,
or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, will adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered Person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (" _Section
16_") of Shares or Company Accelerated Equity Awards pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger will be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16\.

5.14 _Exchange Act Deregistration_. The Company and Parent will cooperate and
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the deregistration under
the Exchange Act of the shares of Company Common Stock as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time in compliance with applicable Law.

 

5.15 _Resignations_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation, effective at
the Effective Time, of each director of the Company in office as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

5.16  _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company will promptly provide Parent with
any pleadings and correspondence relating to any Proceedings involving the
Company or any of its officers or directors relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including disclosures made under securities
laws and regulations related thereto, will keep Parent reasonably informed on
a reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof, and will
cooperate with Parent in the defense or settlement of any such Proceeding,
and no such settlement will be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
The Company will consult and cooperate with Parent and will consider in good
faith the views of the Parent in connection with any stockholder litigation.
In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Company will permit
authorized Representatives of Parent to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such stockholder litigation and to have access to and
be consulted in connection with any document submitted in connection
therewith.

 



-55- 5.17 _Payoff Documentation; Financing_.

money of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 5.17_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule to deliver at least four (4) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date a customary "payoff letter" providing, upon receipt
of the applicable payoff amounts, (i) that such indebtedness shall have been
repaid and (ii) if such indebtedness is secured, that all Liens held by or on
behalf of such lenders in respect of the properties and assets of the Company

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, solely to
the extent permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture, (i) within 29 days
following the date hereof, issue one or more notices of optional redemption
for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes,
pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture, in order to effect a redemption on
the Closing Date; _provided_ , that such redemption notice shall be subject to
and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing, and (ii) at the written
request of Parent, provide any other cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent to facilitate the redemption of the Senior Notes effective as of and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, including with respect
to release of all Liens securing the Senior Notes (subject to the payment by
Parent of all amounts owed to the holders thereof in connection with such
redemption). Parent shall deposit, or shall cause one or more of its
Subsidiaries to deposit with the appropriate Person under the Senior Notes
Indenture, an amount sufficient to pay in full the redemption price of,
accrued interest on, and the Applicable Prepayment Premium (as defined in the

the right of Parent to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Debt Fee Letters in accordance with this  _Section
5.17_); (ii) satisfying on a timely basis (or, if deemed advisable by Parent,
obtaining a waiver with respect to) all Financing Conditions; and (iii)
negotiating, executing and delivering definitive debt agreements on terms and

Debt Fee Letters) or on such other terms acceptable to Parent and its
financings sources. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach
or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent
becomes aware if such breach or repudiation would reasonably be expected to
affect the timely availability of, or the amount of, the Debt Financing, or
the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger. Without limiting Parents
other obligations under this _Section 5.17_, if a Financing Failure Event
occurs, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such Financing
Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, use reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from alternative financing sources, in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate cash to be paid as Merger Consideration and
the aggregate Company Accelerated Equity

 



-56-  Award Payments pursuant to this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to
arrange or obtain any alternative financing having terms and conditions
(including "market flex" provisions) less favorable to Parent than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Debt Fee Letters (it being
understood that the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger are not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of any financing arrangements, the
obtaining by Parent or Merger Sub of any financing or the availability,
grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent or Merger Sub), and
(iii) when obtained, provide the Company with a true and complete copy of, a
new financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing (it
being understood that any "market flex" provisions may be redacted). In the
event that alternative financing is arranged in accordance with this _Section
5.17(c)_, the term "Debt Commitment Letters" shall mean the commitment
letters for such alternative financing and the term "Debt Financing" shall
include such alternative financing. Except for substitutions and replacements
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall not amend,
modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or replace the Debt Commitment
Letters in any manner that would (A) expand or impose new conditions precedent
to the funding of the Debt Financing from those set forth therein on the date
hereof, (B) extend the timing of the funding of the Debt Financing thereunder
or reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the availability of all
or a portion of the Debt Financing or the ability of Parent to consummate the
Merger in accordance with the terms of the Parent Credit Agreement, (C) reduce
the aggregate cash amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing
(except as set forth in any "market flex" provisions existing on the date
hereof)) or (D) adversely impact in any material respect the remedies
available to Parent under the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive
debt agreements with respect thereto, in each case, without the prior written
approval of the Company, (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (it being understood that the exercise of any "market
flex" provisions under the Debt Fee Letters shall not be deemed an amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Debt Commitment Letters); _provided_ , that Parent may amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed a Debt Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof. At the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall
keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status of Parents
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts (including using reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective officers, employees and Representatives) to cooperate

timely basis of, all conditions precedent to the Debt Financing (as is
customary or required in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letters and as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Debt

information reasonably necessary for Parent to prepare a pro forma combined

similar governing body) shall be required to be taken prior to the Effective
Date.

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require such cooperation
to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries; provided, further, that the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective directors or
officers shall not be required to take any action in the capacity as a

void and of no effect, and there will be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
officers or directors except (i) with respect to the last sentence of 
_Section 5.3(a)_, _Section 5.8_, the second-to-last sentence of _Section
5.17(d)_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article 8_ and (ii) with respect to any
liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the
fraud or willful and material breach by another party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_, then the Company will pay to Parent prior to or
concurrent with such termination, in the case of a termination by the Company,
or within two (2) Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by
Parent, the Breakup Fee.

 

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_, _Section 7.1(f)_ or  _Section 7.1(h)_, (ii) prior to the date of
the Company Stockholder Meeting (or prior to the termination of this Agreement

have been publicly announced or will have become publicly known and is not
withdrawn and (iii) within 12 months following the termination of this
Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive written agreement providing

Company will pay to Parent the Breakup Fee, less the amount of any Expense Fee
previously paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ ( _provided_ , that
for purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" will
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 8.4_, except that the

by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement and (iii) the Breakup Fee is not

-63-  compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such Breakup
Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities
forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the fees due pursuant

the Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
applicable fee (or any portion thereof that has not been paid timely in
accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs and expenses,
at the prime lending rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. Any interest payable hereunder
shall be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required
to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that the Breakup Fee and the other amounts set forth in _Section 7.2(e)_ are
paid pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, Parents right to receive payment of the
Breakup Fee and such other amounts shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives against the Company and its
Affiliates and Representatives under this Agreement or arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or

Electronic Delivery will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No party will raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or
the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto will be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof in any court
referred to in _Section 8.12(b)_, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party hereto further
agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of
such breach or violation, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate or that the consideration reflected in this Agreement was
inadequate or that the terms of this Agreement were not just and reasonable.
