AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of April 1, 2003,
by and between NS ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"),
and NATIONAL SERVICE INDUSTRIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the parties to this
Agreement desire to effect the acquisition of the Company by the stockholders
of Buyer;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Buyer will merge with and into
the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL,
with the Company as the surviving corporation;   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of the Company has unanimously determined that the Merger and this
Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the
holders of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock");   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Buyer has
approved this Agreement and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the
Company has unanimously approved this Agreement and the Merger, and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which approval was based in part on the
opinion of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey (the "Financial Advisor"), financial
advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company, that, as of the date of
such opinion and based on the assumptions, qualifications and limitations
contained therein, the consideration to be received by the Company\'s
stockholders for their shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair,
from a financial point of view, to those stockholders;   WHEREAS, the Board
of Directors of the Company has declared the Merger advisable and, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, has unanimously resolved to
recommend that the holders of the Company Common Stock approve the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and   WHEREAS,
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and
inducement to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this Agreement, King and
Spalding LLP has issued an opinion to the Company, as required under the Tax
Disaffiliation Agreement (as hereinafter defined), to the effect that the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will not
cause Section 355(e) or 355(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), to apply to the Company\'s spin-off of Acuity
Brands, Inc.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.   THE MERGER   Section 1.1. The Merger.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined),
Buyer shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Buyer shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"). The corporate existence of the Company, with all its purposes,
rights, privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall continue unaffected
and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.   Section 1.2. Effective
Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5)
business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VI hereof, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and by making all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger,
in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or at such other time as shall be specified in
the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective,
the "Effective Time"). On the date of such filing (the "Closing Date"), a
closing (the "Closing") shall be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time,
at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 191 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia
30303, or at such other time and location as the parties hereto shall
otherwise agree.   Section 1.3. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Buyer shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Company and Buyer shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.4. Conversion of Company Common Stock. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Buyer, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of Buyer or
the Company, the capital stock of the Company and Buyer shall be converted as
follows:   -2-   (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
cancelled  pursuant to Section 1.4(b) and Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined),  if any) (together with the associated preferred stock purchase
rights)  shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in  cash equal to TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) payable, without interest, to the 
holder of such share of Company Common Stock, upon surrender of the 
certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in 
the manner provided in Section 1.10 (the "Merger Consideration");   (b) Each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is owned by Buyer and each  share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury  stock shall be canceled and
retired and cease to exist and no payment or  distribution shall be made with
respect thereto;   (c) All shares of the Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to  Section 1.4(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be  canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate  ("Certificate") representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall  cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive  the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement;
and   (d) Each share of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of Buyer 
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be 
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable 
share of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Surviving 
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital 
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.5. Changes in Shares. If,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction.   Section 1.6. Dissenting Shares.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately  prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by holders of Company  Common Stock
(the "Company Stockholders") who have demanded and perfected  their demands
for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in the  time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the  Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights  to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares")  shall not be converted as
described in Section 1.4(a), but shall, by  virtue of the Merger, be entitled
to only such rights as are granted by  Section 262 of the DGCL; provided,  
-3-   however, that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have  effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and 
payment under the DGCL, such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock shall 
thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, as 
described in Section 1.4(a), into the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration set forth in such provisions, without any interest thereon.  
(b) The Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands for  appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company or  withdrawals
of such demands, and Buyer shall have the right to participate  in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such  demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of  Buyer or as otherwise
required by applicable law, make any payment with  respect to any such
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any  such demands.  
Section 1.7. Stock Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that each option
granted under any stock option or compensation plan or arrangement to acquire
Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Option") which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable,
shall be cancelled, effective as of the Effective Time, in exchange for a
single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; provided, however,
if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled
in exchange for such cash payment, if any, as shall be reasonably agreed to
by the parties hereto. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall take or cause to be taken any and all actions reasonably
necessary to give effect to the treatment of Company Options pursuant to this
Section 1.7. The holders of the Company Options shall be entitled to enforce
this Section 1.7 against the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.8.
Restricted Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take all actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that, at the Effective Time, each share
of restricted Company Common Stock granted under any compensation plan or
arrangement which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time which was theretofore unvested shall become fully vested and shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.4(a). Each share of unissued restricted Company Common
Stock underlying a performance-based award granted under any stock option
or compensation plan or arrangement (each, a "Company Restricted Stock
Award") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
issued in amounts reflecting full satisfaction of any performance criteria
and shall be deemed fully vested, effective as of the Effective Time, and
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4(a).   Section 1.9. Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary and appropriate to provide that the Company\'s Employee
Stock   -4-  Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") shall be terminated and purchases
under the ESPP shall be terminated effective on or prior to the Effective
Time.   Section 1.10. Surrender of Shares of Company Common Stock; Stock
Transfer Books.    (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall designate
EquiServe,  L.P. (or if EquiServe, L.P. is otherwise unwilling or unable to
serve on  terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer, another bank or trust
company  reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent")  for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
funds  necessary to make the payments to such holders pursuant to Section
1.4  upon surrender of their Certificates. Buyer will, as of the Effective 
Time, deposit with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to  be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Fund"). The  Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Buyer. Any net  profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such  investments, shall
be payable to the Surviving Corporation. Buyer shall  replace any monies lost
through any investment made pursuant to this  Section 1.10(a). The Paying
Agent shall make the payments provided in  Section 1.4.   (b) Within ten
(10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation shall cause to
be mailed to each person who was, at the  Effective Time, a holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock  entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 a  form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only  upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent) and  instructions for use (which letter of transmittal
and instructions shall  be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company
prior to the  Effective Time) in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
pursuant to  such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent
of a  Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and  validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such 
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the  holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor the
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock  formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be  canceled.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, at and after  the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the right to receive  such
Merger Consideration. No interest shall accrue or be paid to any  beneficial
owner of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of any  Certificate
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon the  surrender of any
Certificate. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to  be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered  Certificate is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it  shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall  be endorsed
in blank or to the Paying Agent or otherwise be in proper form  for transfer
and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid  all transfer and
other taxes required by reason of the payment of the  Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of the  Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of  the Surviving Corporation that
such taxes either have been paid or are not  applicable. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,  upon making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such   -5-   Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the  Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such person of a bond in such  reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity  against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such  Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen  or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration such holder  is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4.   (c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective 
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying 
Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Fund which had been made  available
to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of shares of  Company Common
Stock (including, without limitation, all interest and  other income received
by the Paying Agent in respect of all amounts held  in the Fund or other
funds made available to it), and thereafter each such  holder shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation  (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws), and only  as general creditors
thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration  that may be payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates held by such  holder. If any Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock  shall not have been surrendered
prior to two (2) years after the Effective  Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which the Merger  Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or  become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined)),  any such cash, shares,
dividends or distributions payable in respect of  such Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become  the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or  interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be  liable to any holder of
a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger  Consideration delivered in
respect of such share of Company Common Stock  to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other  similar law.   (d) At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company  shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of  transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.  From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common  Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to  have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except  as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable law, and all cash paid  pursuant to this Article I
upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates  shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights  pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented  by such Certificate.   (e) The
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may  be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration  otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of  Company Common
Stock and Company Options such amounts that the Surviving  Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with  respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, the rules and  regulations promulgated
thereunder or any provision of state, local or  foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the  Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated  for all purposes of this
Agreement as   -6-   having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock and  Company Options in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was  made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent.   ARTICLE II.   THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   Section 2.1.
Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to read
in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit 2.1 attached hereto and as so amended
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or repealed in accordance with
applicable law or such Certificate of Incorporation.   Section 2.2. Bylaws.
The Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit 2.2
attached hereto and as so amended shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or repealed
in accordance with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation or such Bylaws.   Section 2.3. Directors and Officers.
From and after the Effective Time, until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified in accordance with applicable law, (i) the directors of Buyer
at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and (ii) the officers of Buyer at the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE III.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter
delivered by the Company to the other parties hereto concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company
represents and warrants to each of the other parties hereto, as of the date
hereof (or, if made as of a specified date, as of such date), as follows:  
Section 3.1. Organization and Standing. Each of the Company and
each Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) (i) is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization, (ii) has full corporate power and authority and all
necessary government approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and (iii) is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse   -7-  Effect (as
hereinafter defined). The Company has furnished or made available to Buyer
true and complete copies of its certificate of incorporation (including any
certificates of designations attached thereto, the "Company Certificate
of Incorporation") and bylaws (the "Company Bylaws") and the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of
each Subsidiary, each as amended to date. Such certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or equivalent organizational documents are in full force and effect,
and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in material violation of any
provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents.   Section 3.2. Capitalization. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 120,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value per share (the
"Preferred Stock"). As of March 31, 2003, (i) 11,195,973 shares of Company
Common Stock are issued and outstanding (including 678,299 shares of unvested
restricted Company Common Stock), all of which are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) 3,282,527 shares of
Company Common Stock are held in the treasury of the Company, (iii) 1,201,084
Company Options are outstanding pursuant to the Company\'s incentive
compensation plans, each such option entitling the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Company Common Stock, (iv) 46,414 shares of Company Common Stock
are issuable pursuant to outstanding Company Restricted Stock Awards, (v)
854,398 shares of Company Common Stock are authorized and reserved for future
issuance pursuant to such incentive compensation plans, (vi) approximately
4,425 shares are subject to outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP
(assuming the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP based
on the closing price per share of Company Common Stock on March 3, 2003), and
(vii) no shares of Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. Section 3.2
of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list, as
of March 31, 2003, of the outstanding Company Options with the exercise price
and of the outstanding Company Restricted Stock Awards. Except as set forth
above or in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of March 31,
2003, there are no options, warrants, convertible securities, subscriptions,
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock plans or stock equivalents or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments (contingent or otherwise) of
any character issued or authorized by the Company relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or
options, warrants, convertible securities, subscriptions or other equity
interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary. All shares of Company Common
Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of Company Stock or any capital stock of any Subsidiary or to pay any
dividend or make any other distribution in respect thereof or to
provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any person. Section 3.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of each corporation,
association, subsidiary, partnership, limited liability company or other
entity of which the Company controls, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of
the outstanding equity interests (each a "Subsidiary" and collectively, the
"Subsidiaries"). Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company owns beneficially and of record all of the  
-8-  issued and outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary. Each
outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary that is a corporation
is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, and each such share owned by the Company or another
Subsidiary is free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on the
Company\'s or such other Subsidiary\'s voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.   Section 3.3. Authority for
Agreement.   (a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to
execute and  deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder
and, subject  to obtaining necessary stockholder approval, to consummate the
Merger and  the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution,  delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, and
the  consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary 
corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the 
Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the 
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other  than,
with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this  Agreement by
the Company Stockholders and the filing and recordation of  appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL. This Agreement has  been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due  authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer, constitutes a legal, valid  and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in  accordance with
its terms. Based, in part, on the representation of Buyer  in Section 4.8,
the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the  outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote at a duly  called and held meeting of
stockholders is the only vote of the Company\'s  Stockholders necessary to
approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (b) At a meeting duly called and held on April 1, 2003,
the Board of  Directors of the Company unanimously (i) determined that this
Agreement  and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are  fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the
Company  Stockholders, (ii) approved, authorized and adopted this Agreement,
the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii)
declared  this Agreement advisable and resolved to recommend approval and
adoption  of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company Stockholders.
Based, in  part, on the representation of Buyer in Section 4.8, the actions
taken by  the Board of Directors of the Company constitute all necessary
approval of  the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby  by the Board of Directors of the Company under the
provisions of the  Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined), Articles
Twelfth and Thirteenth  of the Company Certificate of Incorporation, and
Section 203 of the DGCL.  Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with respect
to or as a result of  this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the  Merger, without any further action on the part of the
Company\'s Board of  Directors or stockholders. Other than Section 203 of the
DGCL, no other  state antitakeover or similar statute is applicable to the
Company in  connection with the Merger, this Agreement or   -9-   any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this  Agreement, the
"Rights Agreement" shall mean that certain Amended and  Restated Rights
Agreement, dated December 17, 1997, as amended, by and  between the Company
and EquiServe, L.P. (as successor-in-interest to First  Chicago Trust Company
of New York). Except for the Rights Agreement,  neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any rights plan, "poison pill"  or similar arrangement.  
(c) The Rights Agreement has been amended so that: (i) Buyer is  exempt from
the definition of "Acquiring Person" contained in the Rights  Agreement, and
no "Stock Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" or  "Triggering Event" (as
such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement)  will occur as a result of
the execution of this Agreement or the  consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby;  and (ii) the Rights Agreement will
terminate and the Rights (as defined in  the Rights Agreement) will expire at
the Effective Time. The Rights  Agreement, as so amended, has not been
further amended or modified. True  and complete copies of the Rights
Agreement and of all amendments thereto  through the date hereof have been
previously provided to Buyer.   (d) The Financial Advisor has delivered to
the Board of Directors of  the Company its written opinion, dated as of the
date of this Agreement,  that, as of such date and based on the assumptions,
qualifications and  limitations contained therein, the Merger Consideration
to be received by  the Company Stockholders in the Merger is fair to such
holders from a  financial point of view. A copy of such opinion is attached
to the Company  Disclosure Letter.   Section 3.4. No Conflict. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
(i) based, in part, on the representation of Buyer in Section 4.8, conflict
with or violate the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries, (ii) subject
to Section 3.5, conflict with or violate in any material respect any United
States federal, state or local or any foreign statute, law, rule, regulation,
ordinance, code, order, judgment, decree or any other requirement or rule of
law (a "Law") applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is
bound or affected, or (iii) except as set forth in Section 3.4 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, result in a breach of or constitute a default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under,
give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, result in triggering any payment or other obligations,
or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or
asset of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or
any property or asset of any of them is bound or affected, except, in the
case of clause (iii) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
-10-   Section 3.5. Required Filings and Consents. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the performance of
this Agreement by the Company will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any United
States federal, state or local or any foreign government or any court,
administrative or regulatory agency or commission or other governmental
authority or agency, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), except
(i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (ii) filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (iii) for those
required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act").   Section 3.6. Permits; Compliance. The Company and
each Subsidiary is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,
certificates, approvals and clearances of any Governmental Entity necessary
for the Company and each such Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on its respective businesses substantially as it is
being conducted as of the date hereof, except where such non-possession would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (the "Company Permits"), and all such Company
Permits are valid and in full force and effect. Except as set forth in
Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter, with respect to the textile
rental and envelope businesses, each of the Company and the Subsidiaries (i)
has been operated at all times since September 1, 2001 in material compliance
with all Laws applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or by
which any property, business or asset of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is bound or affected and (ii) is not in default or violation of
any Material Contracts to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is
a party or by which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any property
or asset of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is bound or affected,
except in the cases of clause (ii), for any defaults or violations which
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.7. SEC Filings, Financial
Statements.   (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports, statements and 
documents required to be filed with the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since September 1, 2001 (collectively, the 
"Company SEC Reports"), under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). As of 
their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports complied in all material 
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations  of
the SEC promulgated thereunder. None of the Company SEC Reports  contained
when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to  state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference  therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light  of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   -11-   (b) All
of the financial statements included in the Company SEC  Reports, in each
case, including any related notes thereto, as filed with  the SEC
(collectively, the "Company Financial Statements") have been  prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods involved  (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the  unaudited statements,
as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and  subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to normal, recurring  audit adjustments which would not
reasonably be expected to, individually  or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect) and fairly  present the consolidated financial
position of the Company and the  Subsidiaries at the respective date thereof
and the consolidated results  of its operations and changes in cash flows for
the periods indicated.   (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.7(c) of the
Company Disclosure  Letter, there are no liabilities of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries  of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether
or not  contingent or absolute, other than (i) liabilities disclosed or
provided  for in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Subsidiaries  at February 28, 2003, including the notes thereto, (ii)
liabilities  disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, (iii)  liabilities incurred on behalf of the Company in connection
with this  Agreement and the contemplated Merger, and (iv) liabilities
incurred in  the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since  February 28, 2003, none of which would reasonably be expected to, 
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 3.8. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof or in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter, since
August 31, 2002, the Company and the Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the ordinary course and consistent with prior
practice and there has not been (i) any event or occurrence of any condition
that has had, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or any other distribution with
respect to any of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary except
for quarterly dividends consistent with past practice, (iii) any material
change in accounting methods, principles or practices employed by the
Company, or (iv) any action of the type described in Sections 5.1(b) or
5.1(c) which, had such action been taken after the date of this Agreement,
would be in violation of any such Section.   Section 3.9. Taxes.   (a) The
Company and each of the Subsidiaries have duly and timely  filed with the
appropriate taxing authorities all Tax Returns (as  hereinafter defined)
required to be filed by any of them through the date  hereof. All such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all  material respects. All Taxes
(as hereinafter defined) of the Company and  the Subsidiaries which are (i)
shown as due on such Tax Returns, (ii)  otherwise due and payable or (iii)
claimed or asserted by any taxing  authority to be due, have been paid,
except for those Taxes being  contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves have been  established in the financial statements included in the
Company SEC  Reports   -12-   filed prior to the date hereof in
accordance with GAAP. The unpaid Taxes  of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the current taxable period did  not, as of the most recent Company
Financial Statements, exceed the  reserve for Tax liability set forth on the
face of the balance sheet in  the most recent Company Financial
Statements.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company
Disclosure  Letter and except for matters which are the responsibility of
Acuity  Brands, Inc. pursuant to the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, there are
no  pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened audits, 
investigations, disputes or claims or other actions for or relating to any 
liability for Taxes with respect to the Company or any of the  Subsidiaries,
and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary knows of any  proposed or
threatened Tax claims or assessments which, if upheld, would  reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a  Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has not waived any statute of  limitations in
respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with  respect to a Tax
assessment or deficiency. Except pursuant to the Tax  Disaffiliation
Agreement or as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company  Disclosure Letter,
no power of attorney granted by the Company with  respect to any Taxes is
currently in force.   (c) There is no pending claim by an authority in a
jurisdiction  where any of the Company and the Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns  and in which it is required to file Tax Returns that it is subject
to  taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor any of the 
Subsidiaries has or has had a "permanent establishment" in any foreign 
country, as defined in any applicable Tax treaty or convention between the 
United States of America and such foreign country. Section 3.9 of the 
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each state in which the Company and 
each Subsidiary is or may be subject to any Tax.   (d) The Company and each
Subsidiary has withheld and paid all Taxes  required to have been withheld
and paid in connection with amounts paid or  owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or  other third party.   (e)
There are no material liens for any Taxes upon the assets of the  Company or
any of the Subsidiaries, other than statutory liens for Taxes  not yet due
and payable and liens for real estate Taxes contested in good  faith.   (f)
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been a United States  real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2)  of the
Code during the applicable period specified in Section  897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Code. Except for the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement,  neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Tax allocation or  sharing agreement.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) has been a  member of an
Affiliated Group filing a consolidated federal income Tax  Return (other than
a group the common parent of which was the Company) or  (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than any of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any  similar provision
of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or  successor, by contract,
or otherwise.   -13-   (g) All elections with respect to Taxes which would
reasonably be  expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material  Adverse Effect on Taxes payable by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries  (either directly to a Governmental Entity or pursuant to the
Tax  Disaffiliation Agreement) with respect to periods after the date
hereof  are set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Except
as  set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the 
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has: (i) consented at any time under 
Section 341(f)(1) of the Code to have the provisions of Section 341(f)(2)  of
the Code apply to any disposition of any of its assets; (ii) agreed, or  is
required by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  or
otherwise, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by  reason
of a change in accounting method or otherwise which would  reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a  Company Material
Adverse Effect on Taxes payable by the Company or any of  the Subsidiaries
(either directly to a Governmental Entity or pursuant to  the Tax
Disaffiliation Agreement); (iii) made an election, or is required,  to treat
any of its assets as owned by another person pursuant to the  provisions of
former Section 168(f) of the Code or as tax-exempt bond  financed property or
tax-exempt use property within the meaning of Section  168 of the Code; (iv)
acquired and does not own any assets that directly  or indirectly secure any
debt the interest on which is tax exempt under  Section 103(a) of the Code;
(v) made or will not make a consent dividend  election under Section 565 of
the Code; or (vi) made any of the foregoing  elections or is required to
apply any of the foregoing rules under any  comparable foreign, state or
local Tax provision.   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company
Disclosure  Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries (i) is
subject to  any joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement or contract
which is  treated as a partnership for Tax purposes, or (ii) is a shareholder
of a  "controlled foreign corporation" as defined in Section 957 of the Code
(or  any similar provision of state, local or foreign law).   (i) The
Company has timely provided or caused to be provided, or has  received
waivers of, all required notices to Acuity Brands, Inc. under  that certain
Tax Disaffiliation Agreement dated as of November 30, 2001  (the "Tax
Disaffiliation Agreement") between the Company and Acuity  Brands, Inc. The
Company has timely made all payments required to be made  by the Company
under the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement.   (j) At no time during the period
beginning on August 30, 1999 and  ending on November 30, 2002, was there any
agreement, understanding or  arrangement, nor were there any Substantial
Negotiations (as defined  below), regarding the Merger or any Similar
Acquisition (as defined  below). The Distributions (as such term is defined
in the Tax  Disaffiliation Agreement) were motivated, in whole or substantial
part, by  corporate business purposes other than a business purpose to
facilitate  any person\'s acquisition of the stock of the Company. The
Distributions  would have occurred at approximately the same time and in
similar form  regardless of the Merger or any Similar Acquisition.   (k)
For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Tax" (and, with correlative 
meaning,   -14-   "Taxes") means any federal, state, local or foreign
income, gross  receipts, property, sales, use, license, excise, franchise,
employment,  payroll, premium, withholding, alternative or added minimum, ad
valorem,  transfer or excise tax, or any other tax, custom, duty,
governmental fee  or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever,
together with  any interest or penalty or addition thereto, whether disputed
or not,  imposed by any Governmental Entity, (ii) "Tax Return" means any
return,  report or similar statement required to be filed with respect to any
Tax  (including any attached schedules), including, without limitation, any 
information return, claim for refund, amended return or declaration of 
estimated Tax, (iii) "Substantial Negotiations" means, with respect to a 
transaction involving the acquisition of stock of the Company, discussions 
of significant economic terms (such as price) by one or more officers, 
directors or Controlling Shareholders (as such term is defined in Treasury 
Reg. Section 1.355-1(h)(3)) of the Company, or another person or persons 
with the implicit or explicit permission of one or more officers,  directors
or Controlling Shareholders of the Company, with the acquirer of  such stock
of the Company or a person or persons with the implicit or  explicit
permission of the acquirer, and (iv) "Similar Acquisition" means,  with
reference to the Merger, a potential transaction that, if  consummated, would
effect a direct or indirect combination of all or a  significant portion of
the same business operations as the combination  that would have been
effected by the Merger (even if the timing or the  terms of the potential
acquisition are different); provided, however, that  an acquisition is not
considered similar to the Merger if the ultimate  owners of Buyer are
substantially different from the ultimate owners of  the business operations
with which the Company would have been combined in  such other potential
acquisition.   Section 3.10. Assets. Except as set forth in the Company\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2002 (the
"Company 10-K") or in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company and each of the Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to, or a
valid leasehold interest in, all of their real and personal properties and
assets reflected in the Company 10-K or acquired after August 31, 2002 (other
than assets disposed of since August 31, 2002 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), in each case free and clear of all
title defects, liens, encumbrances and restrictions, except for (i) liens,
encumbrances or restrictions which secure indebtedness which are properly
reflected in the Company 10-K; (ii) liens for Taxes accrued but not yet
payable; (iii) liens arising as a matter of law in the ordinary course of
business with respect to obligations incurred after August 31, 2002, provided
that the obligations secured by such liens are not delinquent; and (iv)
defects, liens, encumbrances and restrictions that are not reasonably
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from the
value of the assets subject thereto or materially impact the operation of the
Company or any Subsidiary. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries
has complied in all material respects with the terms of all real and
personal property leases to which it is a party, and all such leases are in
full force and effect.   Section 3.11. Change of Control Arrangements.
Except as set forth in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will (either
alone or in conjunction with any other event, including termination of
employment at or following the Effective Time) result in, cause the
accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase   -15-  the amount or
value of, any severance, termination or other payment or benefit to any
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary.
Prior to the Effective Time and as contemplated by Section 5.13(d), the
Company will have taken action with respect to the Company Benefit Plans
and Benefit Agreements to provide reasonable assurances that (i) no amount
paid or payable by the Company in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) no
director, officer, employee or consultant will be subject to the excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code.   Section 3.12. Litigation. Except for such
matters set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof
or in Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no claims,
suits, actions, investigations, indictments or information, or
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings ("Litigation") pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries which would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
of the Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction,
decree or arbitration ruling, award or other finding which has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.13. Material Contracts. Except as set
forth in Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter or as filed prior to
the date hereof as an exhibit to the Company SEC Reports, neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is a party to or bound by, and none of their respective
properties or assets are bound by or subject to, any written or oral
contract, agreement or arrangement which (i) is a "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (ii)
involves annual expenditures by the Company in excess of $2,000,000, (iii)
contains any non-compete or exclusivity provisions with respect to the
business of or geographic area with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary,
or restricts the conduct of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary, or
the geographic area in which the Company or any Subsidiary may conduct
business, in each case in any material respect, (iv) is a contract, agreement
or arrangement with the Company or any Subsidiary on the one hand, and any
officer, director or other affiliate on the other hand, or (v) is a contract,
agreement or arrangement under which the Company or any Subsidiary has (a)
incurred any indebtedness that is currently owing or (b) given any
guarantee in respect of indebtedness, in each case having an aggregate

arrangements described in clauses (i) through (v) above, whether or not set
forth in Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter or filed as an exhibit
to the Company SEC Reports, are referred to herein individually as a
"Material Contract" and collectively as the "Material Contracts." Each
Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company and each Subsidiary
party thereto and, to the Company\'s knowledge, each other party thereto, and
in full force and effect, and the Company and each Subsidiary has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it
prior to the date hereof under each Material Contract and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, each other party to each Material Contract has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it
under such Material Contract. Except as set forth in Section 3.13 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received notice of any violation or default under (or any condition which
with the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation
of or default   -16-  under) any Material Contract.   Section 3.14.
Information Supplied. The proxy statement to be mailed to the Company
Stockholders in connection with the meeting (the "Stockholders\' Meeting") to
be called to consider the Merger (the "Proxy Statement"), at the date such
document is first published, sent or delivered to Company Stockholders, will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form
and substance in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange
Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by Buyer for inclusion or incorporation by

defined), are hereinafter referred to as the "Company  Benefit Plans"), and
all employment, consulting, deferred compensation,  indemnification,
severance or termination agreements or similar  arrangements or
understandings between the Company or any of the  Subsidiaries and any
current or former employee, officer, consultant or  director of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries which are currently in  effect (collectively, the
"Benefit Agreements") are listed in Section 3.15  of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure  Letter indicates which of the
Company Benefit Plans are "employee pension  benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes referred to  herein as "Pension Plans"), and
"employee welfare benefit plans" (as  defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
(together with the Pension Plans, the  "ERISA Plans"). The Company has
provided to, or made available for review  by, Buyer true and complete copies
of (i) each Company Benefit Plan and  Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of
any unwritten Company Benefit Plan  or Benefit Agreement, a description
thereof), (ii) the two most recent  annual reports on Form 5500 filed with
the Internal Revenue Service with  respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if
any such report was required),  (iii) the most recent summary plan
description for each Company Benefit  Plan for which such summary plan
description is required and (iv) each  trust agreement and insurance or group
annuity contract relating to any  Company Benefit Plan.   -17-   (b)
Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure  Letter, the
ERISA Plans have been maintained and administered in all  material respects
in compliance with the requirements of ERISA, and the  Code, and any ERISA
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of  the Code has received
a favorable determination letter and continues to  satisfy the requirements
for such qualification. The Company has provided  to Buyer a true and
complete copy of the most recent determination letter  received with respect
to each Pension Plan, as well as a true and complete  copy of each pending
application for a determination letter, if any.  Section 3.15 of the Company
Disclosure Letter lists any ERISA Plan which  is covered by Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code. Neither any  ERISA Plan, nor the Company nor any
Subsidiary has incurred any material  liability or penalty under Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502(i) or  Section 502(l) of ERISA or engaged in any
transaction that is reasonably  likely to result in any such material
liability or penalty. There is no  pending or anticipated Litigation against
or otherwise involving any of  the Company Benefit Plans or Benefit
Agreements, and no Litigation  (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the
ordinary course of Company  Benefit Plan activities) has been brought against
or with respect to any  such Company Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement which
would reasonably be  expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material  Adverse Effect.   (c) Section 3.15 of the Company
Disclosure Letter lists each pension  plan which is a "multiemployer plan",
within the meaning of Section  4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Pension
Plan"), and neither the  Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any
withdrawal liability under  Title IV of ERISA to any such Multiemployer
Pension Plan. All  contributions and premiums and benefit payments required
to be made under  the terms of any Company Benefit Plan as of the date hereof
have been  timely made.   (d) Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the
Company Disclosure  Letter, all material reports, returns and similar

could reasonably lead to a Superior Proposal and subject to the  Company\'s
compliance with Section 5.5(b), (A) furnish information with  respect to the

with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,  and (C) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(i) hereof and  enter into an agreement, arrangement

For so long as this Agreement shall not have been terminated in  accordance
with its terms, the Company\'s Board of Directors shall not  redeem the
Rights or waive or amend any provision of the Rights Agreement,  in any such
case to permit or facilitate the consummation of any  Acquisition
Proposal.   (b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in no
event  later than 48 hours after receipt thereof), advise Buyer of any
inquiry  received by it relating to any Acquisition Proposal and of the
material  terms of any proposal or inquiry (other than the identity of the
person  making the same) that it may receive in respect of any such
Acquisition  Proposal, or of any information requested from it or of any
negotiations  or discussions being sought to be initiated with it, shall
furnish to  Buyer a copy of any such proposal or inquiry, if it is in
writing, or an  oral summary of any such proposal or inquiry, if it is not in
writing, and  shall keep Buyer fully informed on a prompt basis with respect
to any  developments with respect to the foregoing.   (c) Neither the

agreement or other similar agreement related to any  Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement described in  Section 5.5(b)).
Nothing contained in this Section 5.5(c) shall prohibit  the Company or the
Company\'s Board of Directors from (A) taking and  disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or  Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, (B) making any disclosure  required by Rule 14a-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (C)  notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in the event  that the Company\'s Board of
Directors determines in good faith that such  action would be in the best
interests of the Company Stockholders,  withdrawing or modifying its
recommendation (a "Subsequent Determination")  of this Agreement no earlier
than three (3) business days following the  day of delivery of written notice
to Buyer of its intention to do so;  provided that the Company continues to
comply with all other provisions of  this Agreement; and provided, further,
that, during such three business  day period, the Company, if requested by
Buyer, negotiates in good faith  with Buyer to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this  Agreement, if any, as would enable the
Company\'s Board of Directors to  recommend this Agreement on such adjusted
terms.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means
any  offer or proposal concerning any (i) merger, consolidation, business 
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any  Subsidiary,
(ii) sale, lease or other disposition directly or indirectly  by merger,
consolidation, business combination, share exchange, joint  venture or

issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by  way of merger,
consolidation, business combination, share exchange, joint  venture or any

to purchase, or securities convertible into or  exchangeable for such
securities) representing 50% or more of the voting  power of the Company,
(iv) transaction in which any person shall acquire  beneficial ownership, or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership or any  group shall have been

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any  bona fide
Acquisition Proposal made by a third party which, in the good  faith judgment
of the Company\'s Board of Directors, taking into account  the various legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and  the person making such
proposal (i) if accepted, is reasonably likely to  be consummated, and (ii)
if consummated would, based upon advice of the  Financial Advisor, result in
a transaction that is more favorable to the  Company\'s stockholders, from a
financial point of view, than the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 5.6. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give
Buyer the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder Litigation against the Company and/or its directors
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to by the Company without Buyer\'s
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   Section 5.7. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is  understood and agreed
that all rights (the "Indemnification Rights") to  indemnification and
exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of  each present and former
director and officer of the Company or the  Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties") as provided in the Company  Certificate of Incorporation or the
Company Bylaws, in each case as in  effect on the date of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other agreements  in effect on the date hereof, shall survive
the Merger, and the Surviving  Corporation shall (i) continue the
Indemnification Rights in full force  and effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time  and (ii) perform, in a timely manner, all
of its obligations with respect  to the Indemnification Rights. Any claims
for indemnification hereunder as  to which the Surviving Corporation has
received written notice prior to  the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
shall survive, whether or not  such claims shall have been finally
adjudicated or settled.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase and  pre-pay in full "tail" directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance  providing for coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to
the  Effective Time for six (6) years from the Effective Time, which
coverage  is reasonably equivalent in scope and amount to the Company
directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance policies in place on the date
of this  Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not, without
Buyer\'s  prior written consent, pay or agree to pay an aggregate premium for
such  insurance in excess of $1,700,000.    -30-   (c) If the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns  (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the  continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or  merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and  assets to any person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision shall  be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation  shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.7.   Section 5.8. Public Announcements. Buyer and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
Merger and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Law or any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange or trading system to
which Buyer or the Company is a party. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, any press release or other public statement
issued by the Company shall be permitted to state that the Board of Directors
of the Company is permitted to receive and consider Acquisition Proposals in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Such press
release or statement shall not be deemed to be a violation of the Company\'s
or the Company\'s Board of Director\'s obligations under this Agreement and
any Acquisition Proposals received in response thereto shall be considered
"unsolicited" by the Company for all purposes under this Agreement and may be
reviewed and considered by the Board of Directors of the Company in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement.   Section 5.9.
Company Stockholders\' Meeting.   (a) The Company shall cause the date of
the Stockholders\' Meeting to  be set for a date as soon as practicable (in
no event later than  forty-five (45) days from the date on which the Proxy
Statement is cleared  by the SEC) for the purpose of voting on the approval
and adoption of this  Agreement and the Merger. The Company shall take all
action necessary in  accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Certificate of  Incorporation and Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice
of, and convene  the Stockholders\' Meeting. Unless the Board of Directors
shall have made a  Subsequent Determination, the Company shall solicit from
holders of shares  of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Stockholders\' Meeting  proxies in favor of such approval and shall take all
other action  necessary to secure the vote or consent of such holders
required by the  DGCL or this Agreement to effect the Merger.   (b) Unless
required by applicable Law or by a court of competent  jurisdiction, without
the consent of Buyer, the Company shall not (i)  postpone or reschedule the
date of the Stockholders\' Meeting once it has  been fixed by the Board of
Directors as set forth in the preceding  paragraph or (ii) adjourn the
Stockholders\' Meeting without taking a vote  with respect to the Merger. In
the event that following the taking of a  vote with respect to the Merger at
the Stockholders\' Meeting, additional  time is required to count the proxies
and ballots submitted at the  Stockholders\' Meeting, the Stockholders\'
Meeting may be adjourned solely  for the purpose of counting such proxies and
ballots and announcing the  final results of the voting on the Merger. In the
event that the Company  postpones, reschedules or adjourns the Stockholders\'
Meeting in a manner    -31-   permitted by the preceding sentences, the
Company shall convene or  reconvene, as the case may be, the Stockholders\'
Meeting as soon as  practicable thereafter.   (c) Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the  contrary, the Company may, if it receives
an unsolicited Acquisition  Proposal, delay the holding of the Stockholders\'
Meeting or the mailing of  the Proxy Statement, in each case for such time as
is necessary for the  Board of Directors of the Company to consider such
Acquisition Proposal  and to determine the effect, if any, on its
recommendation of the Merger  and this Agreement; provided, that, any such
delay shall not extend beyond  the earlier of (i) twenty (20) business days
or (ii) the latest date as  would permit the Closing to occur by the Outside
Date.   Section 5.10. Proxy Statement. The Company will as promptly as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement (in no event later than
fourteen (14) days thereafter) prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the
SEC, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC and to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders at the
earliest practical time. Buyer and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning it as the other may reasonably request in connection with such
actions. Each party to this Agreement will notify the other parties and the
Board of Directors of the Company promptly of the receipt of the comments of
the SEC, if any, and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto,
and will supply the other parties with copies of all correspondence between
such party or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the
Merger. If (A) at any time prior to the Stockholders\' Meeting, any event
should occur relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which should
be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the
Company will promptly inform Buyer and (B) if at any time prior to the
Stockholders\' Meeting, any event should occur relating to Buyer or any of
its associates or affiliates, or relating to the plans of any such persons
for the Company after the Effective Time that should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Buyer will
promptly inform the Company, and in the case of (A) or (B) the Company and
Buyer, will, upon learning of such event, promptly prepare, and the Company
shall file and, if required, mail such amendment or supplement to the Company
Stockholders; provided, prior to such filing or mailing, the Company and
Buyer shall consult with each other with respect to such amendment or
supplement and shall incorporate the other\'s comments thereon. The Proxy
Statement shall (subject to Section 5.5(c)) include the recommendation of the
Company\'s Board of Directors that the Company Stockholders vote to approve
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that
the Company\'s Board has determined that the Merger is advisable.   Section
5.11. Director Resignations. The Company shall cause to be delivered to Buyer
resignations of all the directors of the Subsidiaries to be effective upon
the consummation of the Merger or at such earlier time as may be agreed by
the parties hereto. The Company shall cause such directors, prior
to resignation, to appoint new directors nominated by Buyer to fill such
vacancies.    -32-   Section 5.12. No Acquisition of Company Common
Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, neither Buyer nor any of its "affiliates"
or "associates" shall become the "owner" (as such terms are defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL) of any shares of Company Common Stock.   Section
5.13. Employee Matters.   (a) Subject to the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining  agreement, for a period of not less than one (1) year
following the  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide all
individuals  who are employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including
employees  who are not actively at work on account of illness, disability or
leave of  absence) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Affected 
Employees") with compensation and benefits which are substantially 
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to 
such Affected Employees as of the date of this Agreement; provided that 
neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation to 
issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, 
shares of capital stock, warrants, options or other rights in respect of  any
shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or 
exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; 
provided, further, that no plans or arrangements of the Company or any of 
the Subsidiaries providing for such issuance shall be taken into account  in
determining whether employee benefits are substantially comparable in  the
aggregate. With respect to each employee benefit plan, program or  policy of
the Surviving Corporation or Buyer or any of its affiliates,  each Affected
Employee shall be given credit under such plan for all  service with the
Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time for  all purposes under
such plan. Such prior service shall also apply for  purposes of satisfying
any waiting periods, evidence of insurability  requirements or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations.  Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, with respect to any  severance protection
agreement or arrangement, or employment letter or  agreement, providing for
compensation or benefits to an employee of the  Company after termination of
employment, the Surviving Corporation shall  confirm in writing that it shall
pay and perform all of the obligations of  the Company pursuant to such
agreements and arrangements.   (b) With respect to the ESPP, the Company
shall take all actions  necessary to provide that (i) the ESPP shall be
terminated on a date  following the date of this Agreement and no offerings
shall be permitted  after such date, and (ii) each participant\'s accumulated
payroll  deductions may be returned to the participant or may be used to
purchase  shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time in
accordance  with the terms of the ESPP.   (c) Nothing contained in this
Section 5.13 or elsewhere in this  Agreement shall be construed to prevent
the termination of employment of  any individual Affected Employee (subject
to the Affected Employee\'s right  to receive any compensation or benefits to
which he or she is entitled)  or, subject to Section 5.13, any change in the
employee benefits available  to any individual Affected Employee or the
amendment or termination of any  particular Company Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement to the extent    -33-   permitted by its terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective  Time.   (d) The Company shall enter
into Employment Agreements, to be  effective as of the Effective Time, with
Carol Morgan, Gene Laminack, J.  Randolph Zook and Richard LeBer in
substantially the form attached hereto  as Exhibit 5.13(d). The Company shall
enter into agreements with Brock A.  Hattox and Chester J. Popkowski,

merge the National Service Industries Pension Plan  A for Employees Covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement and the  Pension Plan Covering Certain
Hourly Employees of National Linen Service,  and if the Company deems it
desirable, the National Service Industries  Pension Plan B with and into the
Pension Plan of AECO Products Division of  National Service Industries, Inc.
(the "AECO Pension Plan"), in accordance  with the requirements of ERISA and
the Code, with the AECO Pension Plan  being the surviving plan.   Section

order to render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 5.15.

immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Equity
Commitment Letter (collectively, the "Commitment Letters") and to satisfy the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters or the related financing
agreements. Buyer shall provide prompt written notice to the Company of any
lender\'s or other party\'s refusal or stated intent to refuse to provide the
financing described in the Commitment Letters and, in each case, the stated
reasons therefor. In any such event, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to find substitute financing for such financing as promptly as

in accordance with Section 7.2(b) of this Agreement.   (d) If (i) (A) Buyer
exercises its right to terminate this Agreement  under Section 7.1(f) or
7.1(g)(ii) or (B) the Company exercises its right  to terminate this
Agreement under Section 7.1(f), and (ii) within twelve  (12) months after
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall enter  into any definitive
agreement relating to, or consummate, an Acquisition  Proposal which was
publicly announced prior to such termination, then,  immediately prior to,
and as a condition of, consummation of such  transaction, the Company shall
pay to Buyer, in same-day funds, the sum of  (x) the Expenses up to a maximum
amount of $3,000,000 and (y) the  Termination Fee; provided that no such
amount shall be payable if the  Expenses or the Termination Fee shall have
become payable or have been  paid in accordance with Section 7.2(b) or 7.2(c)
of this Agreement.   Section 7.3. Interest and Costs; Other Remedies. The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any of the
amounts due pursuant to Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Buyer makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company, the
Company shall pay to Buyer its reasonable fees and expenses   
-39-  (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section
7.2 at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made. The parties agree that the payment of the Expenses
and the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.2 shall be the exclusive
monetary remedies of Buyer upon any breach of this Agreement by the Company
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under
this Agreement.   Section 7.4. Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto; provided, however, that after approval of the Merger by the Company
Stockholders, no amendment shall be made that requires further approval by
the Company Stockholders without such approval having been obtained.  
Section 7.5. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the Stockholders\' Meeting, any party hereto may (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any
other party hereto or (ii) waive any inaccuracy of any representations
or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or
conditions of any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed
a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.   ARTICLE VIII.   GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 8.1.
No Third Party Beneficiaries. Other than the provisions of Article I and
Sections 5.7 and 5.13 hereof, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto.   Section
8.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The parties
hereby agree that for purposes of this Agreement (including, but not limited
to, conditions to Closing) neither party has made to the other
any representations, warranties or covenants or other disclosures other than
those contained in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter. No
amendment, modification or alteration of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter shall be binding unless the same
shall be in writing and duly executed by the parties hereto.   Section 8.3.
Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties named herein and their respective successors. No
party may    -40-  assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties.   Section 8.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  
Section 8.5. Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.   Section 8.6. Governing Law. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law
thereof.   Section 8.7. Severability. Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall
be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which
the judgment may be appealed.   Section 8.8. Specific Performance. Each of
the parties acknowledges and agrees that the other party would be damaged
irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached.
Accordingly, subject to Section 7.3, each of the parties agrees that the
other party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity.   Section 8.9. Construction. The language
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the
parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."   Section 8.10.
