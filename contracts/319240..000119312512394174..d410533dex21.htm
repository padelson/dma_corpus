or circumstances described in the applicable condition no longer exist or are
validly waived and (ii) the End Date and (2) Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause it to, extend the offer to the extent requested in writing by the
Company no less than two (2) Business Days prior to any then scheduled

the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall,

necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub
accepts or is obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer.

the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, accept for
payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and

14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. For the further avoidance of
doubt, the Acceptance Time shall not be extended by any subsequent offering
periods.

other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.

opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the
Company and its counsel any and all written comments that Parent, Merger
Sub or their counsel may receive in writing from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents promptly after receipt
thereof, and Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review any written response to any such written
comments of the SEC or its staff.

Section 2.2 _Top-Up Option_. 

(a) The Company grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ ") to purchase from the Company an aggregate number of newly-issued
shares of Company Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than the number of shares of Company
Common Stock necessary for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company pursuant
to Section 253 of the DGCL (after giving effect to the issuance of shares
pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option), and (ii) the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue
under the Company Certificate of Incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued)
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. Without the prior written
consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option shall not be
assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and
any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 2.2(a) _shall be null
and void. 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub only once, in whole but
not in part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time and prior to
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and only if Parent
and Merger Sub

 



17  irrevocably commit upon purchase of the shares of Company Common Stock upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option to immediately effect the Merger pursuant to
_Section 7.3_. The aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of
Company Common Stock being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up
Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such shares by the
Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger Sub, at its election:
(x) (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds; (y) by (A) paying in
cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of the shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by
Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (B) executing and delivering to
the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate
purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash
pursuant to the preceding clause (A); or (z) any combination of the
consideration described in clauses (x) or (y). Any such promissory note shall
be on terms as provided by Merger Sub, which terms shall include the
following: (i) the principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory
note shall be payable upon the demand of the Company, (ii) the unpaid
principal amount of the promissory note will accrue simple interest at the per
annum rate of 3.0%, (iii) the promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty or prior
notice and (iv) the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the
promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in the event that
(x) Merger Sub fails to make any payment of interest on the promissory note as
provided therein and such failure continues for a period of 30 days or (y)
Merger Sub files or has filed against it any petition under any bankruptcy or
insolvency law or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors. The
promissory note shall have no other material terms. The Company Board has
determined that such consideration for the Top-Up Option Shares is adequate
in accordance with the DGCL and otherwise taken all steps necessary such that
upon issuance and delivery in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ the Top-Up
Option Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

(c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) its calculation of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub intends to
purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or
Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price, and (iii) the place
and time at which the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common
Stock by Merger Sub is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of such
shares of Company Common Stock, Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such
shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub (as the case
may be) a certificate representing such shares.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the shares of Company Common Stock
that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option (" _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be
issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the
Securities Act for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under 

 



18  the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all

conditions therefor and any information regarding work done for Parent or the

the Company Financial Advisor referred to in _Section 5.3(c)_, and (C) the
information that formed the basis for rendering such opinion, subject to the

Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company upon

by applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub

necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and any other applicable Governmental Entity and disseminated to the
Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
securities Laws. Except with respect to any amendments filed in connection
with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto required to be filed
with the SEC pursuant to Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in any
case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall provide in

20 (c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall,
or shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly following a request by Parent,
furnish Parent, at Parents cost and expense, with such information as Parent
or its Representatives may reasonably request in order to disseminate
and otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
Company Common Stock, including a list, as of the most recent practicable
date, of the Company Stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer files containing the names and addresses of all record and
beneficial holders of Company Common Stock, and lists of security positions of
Company Common Stock held in stock depositories (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels, listings or files of securities positions).
Subject to any and all applicable Laws, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and
shall cause their respective Representatives to):

(i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and listings or files of securities positions on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement;

 

(ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger;
and

 

(iii) if (A) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or
_Section 9.2_ hereof and/or (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall irrevocably
withdraw the Offer, upon the Companys request, at Parents option, either (x)
return (and shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause their
Representatives to return) to the Company, or (ii) or destroy, any and all
copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or under their control.

Section 2.4 _Company Board and Company Board Committees_.

 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which term
herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether
Parent shall exercise its rights under this  _Section 2.4(a)_) and from time
to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next
whole number) obtained by multiplying (i) the number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_) and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub
(giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the
Offer and, if the Top-Up Option is exercised, the shares of Company Common
Stock purchased upon the exercise 

 



21  of the Top-Up Option), and the denominator of which is the total number of
then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Promptly following a request
by Parent, the Company shall cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including (at the election of
Parent) either by increasing the size of the Company Board or by seeking and
accepting or otherwise securing the resignations of such number of then
incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so designated by
Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board (the date on which the
majority of the Companys directors are designees of Parent that have been
effectively elected or appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith,
the " _Board Appointment Date_ "). From time to time after the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals
so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same percentage
(rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on each committee
of the Company Board to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Laws,
including the rules of the Nasdaq. Solely for purposes of this _Section
2.4_, any and all members of the Company Board immediately prior to such
appointments by Parent who remain on the Company Board after such appointments
by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing Directors_." The Company has
obtained irrevocable resignations of each director on the Company Board, which
resignations are each contingent solely upon the consummation of the Offer and
the Companys acceptance of such resignation. The Company has made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of such resignations. Upon the
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall accept such number of
resignations as will be necessary to effectuate the exercise of Parents
rights under this _Section 2.4(a)_.

(b) _Continued Listing_. In the event that Parents designees are elected or
appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, until the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least such number of directors
as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws
who are considered independent directors within the meaning of such Laws ("
_Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to
elect to be treated as a "Controlled Company" for purposes of Listing Rule
5615(c) of the Nasdaq rules (or any successor provision) and make all
necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the event the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below the number of directors as may be required by such Laws for any
reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors
as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws,
to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders or Affiliates of Parent
or Merger Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors
for purposes of this Agreement.

(c) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_
hereof shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ and

 



22  Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in
order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.4_, and shall include
in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
directors and officers as is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.4_. Parent shall
provide to the Company in writing, and be responsible for any information
with respect to itself and its nominees, directors, officers and Affiliates,
required by such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The provisions of this  _Section 2.4_ are in addition to, and
shall not limit, any right that Merger Sub, Parent or any Affiliate of Merger
Sub or Parent may have (with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise) under applicable Laws as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of
Company Common Stock.

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees
are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ hereof and there shall be any Continuing
Directors, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or the
sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director)
shall be required in order to, prior to the Effective Time, (i) amend or
terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment or termination
of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time
for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent
or Merger Sub under this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the Companys rights
under this Agreement, or (iv) make any other determination with respect to any
action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, until the
Effective Time, (x) the approval of any of the foregoing actions by a majority
of the Continuing Directors shall constitute the valid authorization of the
Company Board with respect to such action (provided that all other
requirements under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws
and under applicable Law are satisfied) and (y) in addition to any
requirements under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws, any quorum of the Company Board for the purposes of any meeting
thereof or transacting of business thereby with respect to the approval
of any of the foregoing actions shall be deemed to require the attendance of
at least one (1) Continuing Director.

ARTICLE IV

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or their respective equityholders, the following shall occur:

(a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_,
and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be converted, subject to  _Section
4.1(d)_, into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price,
payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each Certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
by Parent or Merger Sub or in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Change in Shares_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock

 



25  occurring or with a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing
in this _Section 4.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this _Article IV_ , through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration
payable in connection with the Merger (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ ")
pursuant to _Section 4.1_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock. The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Company Common Stock; and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
4.1_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, in
each case as directed by Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time),
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
," it being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall
be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) and whose shares of Company
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and with such other provisions as Parent may determine (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter
of

 



26  transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such
shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry
through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-
entry account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 4.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be paid an
amount for the shares represented thereby in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 4.3_.

(c) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration
would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 



27 (g) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect
to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

Section 4.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1_, but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to
be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 262
of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1_, without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or written threats
thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do
any of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and
agreed that, for all purposes under Section 262 of the DGCL and to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares shall be determined without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up
Option Shares or any promissory note delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the
Company in payment for the Top-Up Option Shares.

Section 4.4  _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the
items contemplated by this _Article IV_ ) and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

 



28 Section 4.5 _Company Options and Company Restricted Stock_.

 

(a) _Waivers_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best
efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or releases, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from holders of Company Options
and Company Restricted Stock Units and take all such other action, in all
cases, without incurring any liabilities in connection therewith, as Parent
may deem to be necessary or reasonably required to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 4.5_. As promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as are required to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 4.5_.

 

(b) _Company Options_. Subject to _Section 4.6_, at the Effective Time, each
Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled, with the
holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive, as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, in full satisfaction of the rights
of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the excess,
if any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option multiplied by, (i) if the
Company Option vests solely upon the continued employment of the holder,
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) if the Company Option
vests, in whole or in part, upon any criteria other than solely by the
continued employment of the holder, the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option that would vest if the target
level of performance had been achieved. If the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than
the per share Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be
canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Promptly
following the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall pay to each holder of a
Company Stock Option, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder
pursuant to this Section 4.5(b) in respect of such Company Stock Option. 

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Subject to _Section 4.6_, at the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit, whether vested or
unvested, shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company Restricted Stock
Unit becoming entitled to receive, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the per share Merger Consideration
multiplied by, (i) if the Company Restricted Stock Unit would otherwise vest
solely upon the continued employment of the holder, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately
prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) if the Company Restricted Stock Unit
would otherwise vest, in whole or in part, upon any criteria other than solely
by the continued employment of the holder, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit that would vest if
the target level of performance had been achieved. Promptly following the
Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following
the Effective Time), Parent shall pay to each holder of a Company Restricted
Stock Unit, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to
this Section 4.5(c) in respect of such Company Restricted Stock Unit.

 



29 (d) _Company Restricted Stock_. Subject to _Section 4.6_, each share of
Company Restricted Stock shall be fully vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the
consideration specified in _Section 4.1_.

 

(e) _Rights Following Closing_. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Stock, whether
or not vested, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, without any action on the part of any parties, and each holder of a
Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit and Company Restricted
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the consideration specified in _Sections 4.5(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ ,
respectively.

 

Section 4.6 _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be
deducted and withheld from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

With respect to any Section of this _Article V_ , except (i) as disclosed in
any report, schedule, form or statement filed with the SEC by the Company
after January 1, 2011 and prior to the date hereof, other than any
disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" and any other
disclosures contained therein that are predictive, cautionary or forward
looking in nature, but it being understood that this clause (i) shall not be
applicable to _Section 5.1_, (Organization and Qualification), _Section 5.2_
(Capitalization), _Section 5.3_ (Corporate Authority; Approval and Opinion of
Financial Advisor),  _Section 5.9_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events),
_Section 5.22_ (Takeover Provisions) and _Section 5.23_ (Brokers), or (ii)
as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company
Subsidiary_ ") is duly organized, is validly existing and, where such concept
is recognized, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, as the case may be, except to the extent the
failure of any such Company Subsidiary to be in good standing, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not be reasonably expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section 5.1_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list of all of the Company

 



30  Subsidiaries, the ownership interest of the Company in each Company
Subsidiary, and the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in each
Company Subsidiary. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has the
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except where the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not be reasonably expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and, where such concept is
recognized, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered
to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary, each as amended to date, and each as so delivered is in full force
and effect. As of any date following the date hereof, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary and notwithstanding anything set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
"significant subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X
under the Exchange Act) has filed for bankruptcy or filed for reorganization
under the U.S. federal bankruptcy Laws or similar state, federal or non-United
States Law, become insolvent or become subject to conservatorship or
receivership. 

Section 5.2 _Capitalization_.

Stock subject to Company Restricted Stock Units, (v) 17,877 shares of Company
Restricted Stock reserved for issuance, (vi) no shares of Company Common
Stock owned by any Company Subsidiary and (vii) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable. All shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise or settlement of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units
have been duly reserved for issuance by the Company, and upon any issuance of
such shares in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan,
will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, there are no options, warrants
or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is bound relating to the issued or unissued Equity
Interests of the Company or obligating the Company to issue or sell any
Equity Interests in the Company. _Section 5.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and

 



31  correct list of (i) the exercise prices and vesting schedules for
outstanding Company Options and (ii) vesting schedules for outstanding Company
Restricted Stock Units and shares of Company Restricted Stock. Except as set
forth in _Section 5.2(a)_, there are no outstanding contractual obligations
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary affecting the voting rights of, or
requiring the repurchase, redemption, issuance, creation or disposition of,
any Equity Interests in the Company. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since September 13, 2012, the Company has
not issued any Equity Interests in the Company, except for issuances pursuant
to exercise or settlement of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
Units in each case outstanding as of the close of business on September 13,
2012, and only in accordance with the terms of such Company Options and
Company Restricted Stock Units as in effect on such date. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company
having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities
having the right to vote) on any matter on which the Company Stockholders may
vote.

(c) Each outstanding share of capital stock or other Equity Interest of each
Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear
of all Liens. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights,
calls, contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or
arrangements relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or
sale of any Equity Interest or other ownership interests of any Company
Subsidiary, including any right of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security, instrument or agreement. 

(d) _Section 5.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name,
jurisdiction of organization and the Companys (or the Company Subsidiarys)
percentage ownership of any and all Persons in which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary owns, or has the right or obligation to acquire any Equity
Interest (other than any Company Subsidiary) (collectively, the "
_Investments_ "). All of the Investments are owned by the Company or by a
Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. Except for the capital stock
and other ownership interests of the Company Subsidiaries and the
Investments, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any Equity
Interest in any Person that is material to the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that requires any additional
filing by Parent under any Antitrust Law.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has entered into
any Contract, or is otherwise obligated, to contribute capital, loan money or
otherwise provide funds or make additional investments in any other Person,
other than any such Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice with respect to wholly owned Subsidiaries of the
Company. There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other
Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any Equity
Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or preemptive rights with
respect thereto.

this Agreement and, subject to obtaining any necessary Company Stockholder
Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of

transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company and no stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than, with
respect to the Merger, the filing of appropriate merger documents as required
by the DGCL and any necessary Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement
is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
Exception.

 

(b) The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), is the only
vote, if any, of the holders of any class or series of the Companys Equity
Interests necessary to adopt this Agreement and the Merger.

 

(c) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board has received
from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ ") its
opinion to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the
limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the $19.50 in
cash per share to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) in the Offer and the
Merger, taken together, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. Promptly following receipt of such opinion in writing by the Company
Board, the Company will furnish a complete and correct copy of such opinion to
Parent solely for informational purposes.

(d) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (i) has
unanimously determined that each of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair
to, and in the best interest of, the Company and the Company Stockholders,

in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement, which recommendation
constitutes an irrevocable recommendation of the Company Board for purposes of
any Takeover Provisions, and (iv) unanimously resolved to direct the
submission of this Agreement to a vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting
for adoption and approval, unless the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company Stockholders is not required by applicable Law. None of the actions
by the Company Board set forth in this _Section 5.3(d)_, subject to _Section
7.5(d)_, has been subsequently withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Parent.

the performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

consents, approvals and authorizations described in _Section 5.4(b)_ will
have been obtained prior to the Acceptance Time and all filings and
notifications described in _Section 5.4(b)_ will have been made and any

Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) require any
consent or approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit
under, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties
or assets are bound, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

available to Parent correct and complete copies of all material correspondence
between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since December 31, 2009 and prior
to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with respect to any
of the Company SEC Filings. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date
hereof, none of the Company SEC Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review,
outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

(b) _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any notes thereto) contained in or incorporated by
reference into the Company SEC Filings (collectively, the " _Company
Financial Statements_ ") was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange
Act) on a consistent basis during the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), and each presented fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and
the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of

 



37  operations and cash flows of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal adjustments which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be material). The books and records of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have been maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions. BDO USA, LLP has not
resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountants of the Company
and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with the Company or any Company Subsidiary on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

 

(c) _Internal Controls_.

(i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have established and maintained a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act). Such internal controls are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys and the
consolidated Company Subsidiaries financial reporting and the preparation of
their financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Since December 31, 2009, the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries
internal controls, and the Company has provided to Parent copies of any
material written materials relating to each of the foregoing. The Company has
made available to Parent all such disclosures made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee of the Company Board since December
31, 2009.

(ii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act);
such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed
under the Exchange Act, including the consolidated Company Subsidiaries, is
made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

 



38 (iii) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any executive
officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or any
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no outstanding
loans or other extensions of credit made by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

Section 5.8 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. None of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (a)
that were incurred after December 31, 2011 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (b) that were set forth on the Companys
consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2011 included in
the Company Financial Statements in the Company SEC filings prior to the date

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2011,
(a) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (b) there has
not been any Company Material Adverse Effect and (c) neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken after the date of
this Agreement without Parents consent, would constitute a breach of any of
the covenants set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ hereof.

 

Section 5.10 _Disclosure Documents_.

(a) Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC or any
other applicable Governmental Entity or required to be distributed or
otherwise disseminated to the Company Stockholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Documents_ "), including the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement (if
applicable), to be filed with the SEC in connection with the Offer and the
Merger, and any amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, distributed or

with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Law.

 

(b) (i) The Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, at the

apply to statements or omissions included in the Company Disclosure Documents
based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by Parent or Merger
Sub specifically for use therein.

 



39 (c) The information with respect to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that the Company furnishes to Parent or Merger Sub for
use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, at the time of the filing of
the Schedule TO, at the time of any distribution or dissemination of the Offer
Documents and at the time of the consummation of the Offer, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

Stock Plans), bonus or other cash or equity-related incentive compensation,

off plans or policies, and any other material plans, agreements, policies,
trust funds or arrangements (whether written or unwritten) (i) established,
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (ii) with respect to which the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any Person that, at any relevant time, could be treated as a single
employer with the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (each, an " _ERISA

(b) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has made available to
Parent (as applicable): (i) copies of all documents setting forth the terms
thereof, including all amendments thereto, (ii) all related trust documents,

arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA),

 



40  or (v) any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that
provides for post-employment or post-retirement medical, life insurance or
other welfare-type benefits (other than health continuation coverage required
by Section 4980B of the Code or similar Law for which the covered individual
pays the full cost of coverage).

(d) Each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is
so qualified and has received a determination letter from the IRS upon which
it may rely regarding its qualified status under the Code for all statutory
and regulatory changes with respect to plan qualification requirements for
which the IRS will issue such a letter and nothing has occurred, whether by
action or by failure to act, that caused or could cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any material penalty or Tax liability.

(e) Each Company Plan complies in form and has been maintained and operated
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law,
including ERISA and the Code. With respect to each Company Plan, (i) there
have been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions" (as defined in Section 406

"service recipient" (within the meaning of Section 409A) is in compliance
with the applicable provisions of Section 409A and neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has been required to report any taxes due as a result of a failure
to comply with Section 409A.

Except as set forth on _Section 5.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Company Plan has any unfunded liabilities.

 

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger) alone, or in combination with any other
event including a termination of any employee, officer, director, manager,
equityholder or other service provider of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries,
will not give rise to any liability under any Company Plan, require funding
of any benefit or otherwise, including any liability for severance pay,
unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer, director, manager,
equityholder or other service provider of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries. No
amount or benefit that could be received (whether in cash or

 



41  property or the vesting of property) as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Company Plan or
otherwise would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. The Company
has provided the following to Parent: (i) the maximum amount that could be
paid to each "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.280G1) in connection with the transactions contemplated

assuming that the individuals employment with the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries is terminated immediately following either the Acceptance Time
and/or the Effective Time, (ii) the grant dates, exercise prices and vesting
schedules applicable to each Company Option granted to the individual, and
(iii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(e) of the Code) for
each such individual as of the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any indemnity obligation on or after the
Effective Time for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

 

(h) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any employee, officer,
director, manager, equityholder or other service provider of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has made any promises or commitments, whether legally
binding or not, to create any additional Company Plan, or to modify or change
in any material way any existing Company Plan. Each Company Plan may be
amended or terminated in accordance with its terms without liability (other
than for accrued benefits) to the Company.

(i) (i) Each Company Option has an exercise price at least equal to the fair
market value of Company Common Stock on a date no earlier than the date of the
corporate action authorizing the grant if such Company Option, (ii) no
Company Option has had its exercise date or grant date delayed or "back-

plan" (as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated and
administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code from the
period beginning January 1, 2005 through the date of this Agreement.

material respects with all labor, employment, employment classification, and
workplace-related Laws. There have been no claims of harassment,
discrimination, retaliatory act or other employment-related Actions against
the Company, any Company subsidiary (or any employee, officer, director or
manager of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in their capacities as such)
at any time during the immediately preceding five (5) years and, to the

Actions against the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any current or former

Section 7.2 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required under applicable Law
in order to consummate the Merger, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the later of the Acceptance Time or the expiration of any subsequent
offering period provided in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in
accordance with applicable Law and the Company Certificate of Incorporation
and the Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, call, convene and hold a
meeting of the Company Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_")
for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL. Except following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made
in accordance with _Section 7.5_, the Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Companys obligation
to establish a record date for, call, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall not be limited
to, or otherwise affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws.

 

(b) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall,
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the later of the Acceptance
Time or the expiration of any subsequent offering period provided in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, prepare and
file with the SEC a proxy statement, letter to stockholders, notice of
meeting and form of proxy accompanying the proxy statement that will be
provided to the Company Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of
proxies for use at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and any schedules
required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith (collectively, as
amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company and Parent,
as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the Company or
Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation and filing with

 



63  the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable Laws, the Company
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following
the date on which the SEC has, orally or in writing, confirmed that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement (or the date which is ten (10)
calendar days following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement if the
Proxy Statement is not subject to SEC review). Except with respect to any
amendments filed in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and all
other materials used in connection with the Merger that (i) constitute "proxy
materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules
14a-1 through 14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise
used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule
14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to Company
Stockholders. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto,
or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection
therewith. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party or Parties, as the case may be, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information
shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders. The Company
shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Nasdaq.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_
hereof, subject to the terms of  _Section 7.5(d)_ hereof, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than
with respect to the Offer).

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all shares of Company Common
Stock acquired in the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by them or any of
their respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or otherwise.

Section 7.3 _Short-Form Merger_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section
7.2_ hereof, if the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders is
not required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, subject to
_Section 8.1(c)_, the Parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the
Acceptance Time in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL without convening
a Company Stockholders Meeting.

information to any Person not a party to, or otherwise covered by, the
Confidentiality Agreement or any similar agreement with respect to such
information or (B) provide access to or furnish any information if doing so
would violate any applicable Law, or where such access to information would
involve the waiver of an attorney-client privilege so long as the Company has
taken all reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not compromise the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to
external counsel for Parent to the extent required for the purpose of
complying with applicable Laws, including Antitrust Laws.

 

(b) _Confidentiality and Restrictions_. With respect to the information
disclosed pursuant to  _Section 7.4(a)_, the Parties shall comply with, and

agreement entered into between the Company and any Person to whom the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative provides

Representatives and the Company Subsidiaries to not:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage (including by providing
information) or take any action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

 



65 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions

on the use of any information or data concerning the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any Person pursuant to any commercial arrangement, joint venture
arrangement, or other existing agreement or arrangement for the purpose of
facilitating any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) fail to enforce or grant any waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill or confidentiality agreement (or any standstill or confidentiality
provision of any other contract or agreement) or Takeover Provisions, or
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt by any Person to make an
Acquisition Proposal (including providing consent or authorization to any
Person to make an Acquisition Proposal to any officer or employee of
the Company or to the Company Board or any member thereof pursuant to any
Existing Confidentiality Agreement);

 

(iv) approve, endorse, recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or

Agreement; or

(v) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.5(a)_ to the contrary, the
Company may inform any Person as to the existence of the provisions of this

any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal or other proposal, offer or inquiry that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. 

The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives and the Company
Subsidiaries to, immediately (a) cease all discussions and negotiations with
any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
deliver a written notice to each such Person to the effect that the Company is
ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, effective on the date hereof, and the notice

 



66  shall also request such Person to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and (b) take all steps necessary to terminate any approval under any
confidentiality or standstill or similar agreement or provision that may have
been heretofore given by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Company

to make an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 7.5(a)_
but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 7.5(b)_, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 7.5(b)_:

 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Person who has
made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date

take such action would violate the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws, and (B) the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with its

Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at

unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is
not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in good faith constitutes
a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal, or (y) the
Company Board may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, if and only if:

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would violate its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Laws;

obligations under this _Section 7.5_;

68  advisors to, during the Notice Period, (1) negotiate with Parent and the

presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent Parent desires to make such
presentation), (3) at the end of the Notice Period the Company Board again
makes the determination in good faith (x) after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or authorize the termination of this Agreement would violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) taking into account any
adjustment or modification to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent,
that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal; _provided_
that, in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 7.5 _(including _Section 7.5(d)_) with respect

notice to Parent of its intention to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders), _provided_ that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation

information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought
to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Representative, in both cases indicating, in connection with such

and director currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Board
Appointment Date with respect to any matter claimed against such person by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that in no event

Schedule), it being understood that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to each year

prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy, in

less favorable in the aggregate to such directors and officers than the
insurance coverage otherwise required under this _Section 7.12(c)_.

the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and

Support Agreements or the transactions provided for herein or therein,
including the Offer and the Merger, and (b) if any Takeover Provision becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreements or the transactions
contemplated herein or therein, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure
that the transactions provided for in this Agreement and the Support
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms

benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former director,
manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment
or modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which the Company
Board determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of
Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq rules and shall be an "independent
director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the

each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 7.15_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

 

Section 7.17 _FIRPTA Certificate_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall

maintain the Company Plans and the annual compensation and cash incentive or
cash bonus opportunities (other than equity compensation or defined benefit
pension plans) of Company Employees on substantially the same terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (including by paying after
December 31, 2012 any cash bonuses earned 

 



75  under the terms of any written Company Plan that has been disclosed to
Parent prior to the date hereof for service on or before December 31, 2012),
(ii) arrange for each Continuing Employee to participate in the employee
benefit plans and arrangements, including annual compensation arrangements, of
Parent or its applicable subsidiary (other than equity compensation or defined
benefit pension plans) (" _Parent Plans_ "), or (iii) a combination of
clauses (i) and (ii) so that, until December 31, 2012, each Continuing
Employee shall have benefits and compensation that are substantially similar
in the aggregate to benefits and compensation (other than equity compensation
or defined benefit pension plans) provided either to such Continuing Employee
before the Effective Time or similarly situated employees of Parent under
Parent Plans.

 

(b) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under
any Parent Plan in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate,
for purposes of eligibility and vesting, to the extent past service was
recognized for such Continuing Employees under comparable Company Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and to the same extent past service
is credited under such plans or arrangements for similarly situated employees
of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
7.18(b)_ shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result
in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under
a defined benefit pension plan, or (iii) service credit under a newly
established plan for which prior service is not taken into account for
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries generally.

(c) In the event of any change in the health or dental benefits provided to
Continuing Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as
to pre existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
under any such benefit plans to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would not apply in the absence of such change, and (ii) for
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each
Continuing Employee with any co payments and deductibles paid prior to any
such change in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirements after such change.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.18_ to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall
limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify
any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates following the Effective Time. If
(i) a party other than the Parties hereto makes a claim or takes other action
to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any employee
benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be
an amendment to such employee benefit plan even though not explicitly
designated as such in this Agreement, then, solely with respect to such
employee benefit plan, such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have
no amendatory effect with respect thereto.

 



76 (e) If requested by Parent at least five (5) calendar days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that include a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of
the Code, effective not later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k)
plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution of the Company Board (the
form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent)
not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 7.18_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including
any employees or former employees of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after the date of
such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Parent.

(iii) In the event that (A) (x) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ and at or prior to the time of
such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed,
announced or commenced and not in good faith withdrawn prior to the time of
such termination, or (y) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(i)_ and at or prior to the time of such termination an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, announced or
commenced or submitted or made known to the Company Board and not in good
faith withdrawn prior to the time of such termination, and (B) at any time
after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of the
twelfth (12th) month after the termination of this Agreement, the Company
consummates any Acquisition Proposal or enters into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement for an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, on the
date any Acquisition Proposal is consummated, pay the Company Termination Fee
(less the amount of any Reimbursable Expenses previously paid pursuant to
_Section 9.4(c)_) to Parent by

 



80  wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by
Parent; _provided_ that, for purposes of this _Section 9.4(b)(iii)_, all
percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be replaced with
50%.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Parent shall have the right to assign the right to receive the
Company Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion. 

(v) In the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee becomes payable
and is paid in accordance with this _Section 9.4(b)_, Parents receipt of
the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this _Section
9.4(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of
their respective former, current and future directors, officers, employees,
agents, general and limited partners, managers, members and stockholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Companys liability for
the Companys willful or intentional material breach of any of its covenants
or obligations in this Agreement be limited to the Company Termination Fee.

 

(c) _Expense Reimbursement_. If (i) after the date of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been announced, commenced, publicly disclosed
or submitted or made known to the Company Board and shall not have been in
good faith withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, and (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_, the Company shall promptly pay Parent or its
designee any documented and reasonable Parent Expenses (the " _Reimbursable
Expenses_ "); provided, however that in no event shall the Reimbursable
Expenses exceed $3,000,000. " _Parent Expenses_ " shall mean all out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Parent, or on behalf of Parent or its
Affiliates, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and
consultants).

 

(d) _Acknowledgement_. Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this  _Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable
are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and, therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section 9.4(c)_ are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.4_, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
_Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section 9.4(c)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amount set forth in _Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section 9.4(c)_ or any portion
thereof, the Company 

 



81  shall pay to Parent costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred
by the Parent and its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

Section 9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and, subject to  _Section 9.6_, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be
made no waiver that by Law (including the relevant rules of the Nasdaq)
requires further approval by the Company Stockholders without the further
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.

 

Section 9.6 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, this Agreement may be
amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective
Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or
after the Acceptance Time or the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) after the Acceptance Time, there shall be no amendment
that decreases the Merger Consideration and (b) after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law
(including the relevant rules of the Nasdaq) requires further approval by the
Company Stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
Parent and the Company.

83 Section 10.3 _Fees and Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent and all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and
fees (including penalties and interest), incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by  _Article IV_. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as
necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws
in connection with the payment of any such amounts, and shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible under such Laws, any
such amounts payable in connection therewith. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is
consummated.

Section 10.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
greatest extent possible.

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto), the Support Agreements, and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 10.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT,
SHALL BE CONSTRUED, PERFORMED, ENFORCED, INTERPRETED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS
PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES
OR RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION.

(b) Any Action against, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
rights and obligations arising hereunder or the transactions contemplated
hereby or for the recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement shall be brought solely and exclusively in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware; _provided_ , that if (and only after) such
Court of Chancery determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over
any such legal Action, such legal Action shall be brought solely

 



84  and exclusively in the Federal courts of the United States of America
located in the County of New Castle, Delaware. Each of the Parties agrees that
a final judgment (subject to any appeals therefrom) in any such Action shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any such court in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 10.6_. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Action in any such court. Each of the Parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 10.2_ (Notices). Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ANY
REPRESENTATIVE OF PARENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.6(C)_.

 

Section 10.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
7.12_ (Indemnification of Directors and Officers), each of Parent and the
Company hereby agrees that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than
the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to
rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The Parties
further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section
7.12_ shall not arise unless and until the occurrence of the earlier of the
Board Appointment Date or Effective Time.

 



85 Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Closing,
Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of
any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the
Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

Section 10.10 _Independence of Agreements, Covenants, Representations and
Warranties_. All agreements and covenants hereunder shall be given independent
effect so that if a certain action or condition constitutes a default under a
certain agreement or covenant, the fact that such action or condition is
permitted by another agreement or covenant shall not affect the occurrence of
such default. In addition, all representations and warranties hereunder shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular representation or warranty
proves to be incorrect or is breached, the fact that another representation
or warranty concerning the same or similar subject matter is correct or is not
breached will not affect the incorrectness of or a breach of a representation
and warranty hereunder. 

Section 10.11 _Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties; accordingly, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

Section 10.12 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and
in two or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 10.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement, and any
amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or by email with facsimile or scan attachment, shall be treated in
all manner and respects as an original Contract and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, each other Party
shall re-

 



86  execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No
Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or by email with facsimile
or scan attachment as a defense to the formation of a Contract, and each such
Party forever waives any such defense.

87 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to compliance

Agreement), and in addition to (and not in limitation of) the rights and
obligations of Merger Sub to extend and/or amend the Offer pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Agreement, Merger Sub (i) shall not be required to
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act (relating to
the obligation of Merger Sub to pay for or return shares of Company Common
Stock tendered in the Offer promptly after termination or withdrawal of the
Offer)), pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer,
and (ii) may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the rules and
regulations referred to in clause (i) above, the payment for, any shares of

permanent in nature) enacted, enforced, amended, issued, in effect or deemed
applicable to the Offer or the Merger, by any Governmental Entity (other than
the application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer
or to the Merger) the effect of which is to make illegal or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

(d) (i) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 5.2(a)_ , _5.2(b)_ , _5.2(c)_ , _5.3(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_
, _5.9(b)_ , _5.22_ , and _5.23_ ) (without giving effect to any materiality

Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall not be true and correct as
of such earlier date), except where any failures of any such representations
and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 5.2(c)_ , _5.3(a)_ ,  _(b)_ , _(d)_ and
_(e)_ , _5.22_ or _5.23_ (without giving effect to any materiality or Company

respects as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of such date subject only to de minimis exceptions; or
(iv) the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 5.9(b)_ shall
not be true and correct, without disregarding the Company Material Adverse
Effect qualification contained therein, as of the date of the Agreement or as
of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date; 

(e) The Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under the Agreement, and such
failure to perform shall not have been cured prior to the Expiration Date;

(f) Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by the chief executive officer of the Company to the effect that none
of the conditions in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this _Annex A_ shall have
occurred and be continuing; 

(g) Since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

Merger Sub or the Company seeking to restrain or prohibit the acquisition of
or payment for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger; or

(i) The Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be asserted by Parent and Merger Sub
regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or
Merger Sub, other than any action or inaction in breach of the Agreement)
giving rise to such condition, in whole or in part at any applicable time or
from time to time in its sole discretion prior to the expiration of the Offer,
and all conditions (except for the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by
Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company) may
be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in their sole discretion, in whole or in
part at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the
terms and conditions of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC.
