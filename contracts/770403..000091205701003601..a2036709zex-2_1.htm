AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of January 30, 2001, by and among Advanced Digital Information Corporation, a Washington corporation (" _Parent_ "), PTech Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Pathlight Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

    
RECITALS 

  

 A. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it advisable and in their respective best interests to effect a merger of the Company and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Merger_ "). 

  

 B. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved this Agreement and the Merger as required by applicable law, and will submit this Agreement to the Company\'s stockholders for their approval. 

  

 C. The Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the sole stockholder of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and the Merger as required by applicable law. 

   

 D. It is intended that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes. 

  

    
AGREEMENT 

  

 In consideration of the terms hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE ITHE MERGER 

  

1.1 The Merger

  

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

1.2 The Closing

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place on the earliest practicable business day (the " _Closing Date_ "), but not later than the fifth business day, after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles IV and V at 10 a.m. local time at the offices of Perkins Coie LLP, 1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800, Seattle, Washington, or such other date, time or location as Parent and the Company shall agree. 

  

1.3 Effective Date and Time

  

 On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the parties hereto shall cause the appropriate certificates (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit 1.3 _complying with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporate Law (" _DGCL_ ") to be properly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ "). The Merger shall become effective on the date (the " _Effective Date_ ") and at the time (the " _Effective Time_ ") of filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger as filed. If the Delaware Secretary of State requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger as a condition to filing or to issuing its certificate to the effect that the Merger is effective, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will execute any necessary revisions 

    incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not materially
inconsistent with and do not result in any material change in the terms of
this Agreement.

   

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

  

 At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to conform to the substantive portions of the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Article I thereof shall be amended to read as follows: " _The name of this corporation is Pathlight Technology, Inc._" Thereafter, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may be amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by law. 

   

1.5 Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

  

 At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company. Thereafter, the Bylaws may be amended or repealed in accordance with their terms and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by law. 

  

1.6 Effects of Merger

  

 The Surviving Corporation shall, by virtue of the Merger and in accordance with the DGCL, possess all the properties and rights and be subject to all the liabilities of the Company and Merger Sub. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have all effects provided by applicable law. 

  

1.7 Directors and Officers

  

 At the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub shall continue in office as the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub shall continue in office as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall hold office in accordance with and subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

1.8 Conversion of Shares

  

  

1.8.1 Exchange Ratio

  

  

 As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective stockholders: 

  

 (a) All shares of any class of capital stock of the Company held by the Company as treasury shares shall be canceled. 

  

 (b) Each issued and outstanding share of preferred stock of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ " and, together with the Company Preferred Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ "), other than shares of Company Capital Stock for which dissenters\' rights are perfected or as provided in Section 1.8.1(a), shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent shares of Parent common stock, no par value per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), with the exchange ratio for each class and series of Company Preferred Stock and for Company Common Stock to be determined by allocating 10,300,000 shares of Parent Common Stock to the holders of Company Capital Stock on a fully diluted basis (e.g _._ , assuming conversion of all notes convertible to Company Capital Stock and the exercise of all outstanding warrants, options and other rights to purchase Company Capital Stock, whether vested or unvested and regardless of any restrictions on conversion or exercise) in accordance with the provisions of the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and thereby 

    deriving an exchange ratio for each share of Company Common Stock (the "
_Company Common Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), and each class and series of
Company Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share (each, a " _Company
Preferred Stock Exchange Ratio_ "). The method for so calculating the Company
Common Stock Exchange Ratio and each of the Company Preferred Stock Exchange
Ratios in accordance with the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation is set
forth on _Exhibit 1.8.1(b). _The shares of Parent Common Stock so issued
together with cash to be received in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.8.3 shall be referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration._ "
The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to each stockholder
of the Company under this Section 1.8.1(b) shall be calculated by aggregating
all shares of Company Common Stock and all shares of each class and series of
Company Preferred Stock held by each such stockholder, so that such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued shall be equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder multiplied by the
Company Common Stock Exchange Ratio and the number of shares of each class and
series of Company Preferred Stock held by such stockholder multiplied by the
applicable Company Preferred Stock Exchange Ratio, with cash paid in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8.3.

   

 (c) Escrow Arrangements 

  

  

 (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to effectiveness of the Merger, 257,500 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Indemnification Escrow Shares_ ") shall be deposited in escrow with Mellon Investor Services LLC ("Mellon") (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to satisfy any indemnification obligations under Article VIII, to be held and administered in accordance with an Indemnification Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit 1.8.1(c)(i) _(the " _Indemnification Escrow Agreement_ "), such Indemnification Escrow Shares to be withheld and deducted, pro rata, from the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to each stockholder of Company Capital Stock at the Effective Time. 

  

 (ii) In addition to the escrow arrangement established pursuant to Section 1.8.1(c)(i), and subject to effectiveness of the Merger, 1,030,000 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Special Liability Escrow Shares_ ") shall be deposited in escrow with the Escrow Agent to satisfy any indemnification obligations under Article VIII, to be held and administered in accordance with a Special Liability Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit 1.8.1(c)(ii) _(the " _Special Liability Escrow Agreement_ "), such Special Liability Escrow Shares to be withheld and deducted, pro rata, from the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to each holder of Company Capital Stock at the Effective Time. 

  

 (iii) All such Indemnification Escrow Shares and Special Liability Escrow Shares shall be free of any other escrow or pledge obligation. Approval of the Merger at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company or by written consent or by delivery of their certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.8.2 shall be deemed to constitute the agreement of the stockholders of the Company with respect to the indemnification obligations of the stockholders and the procedures set forth in Article VIII. Fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall not be deposited in escrow. In lieu thereof, each stockholder shall round such fractional share to the nearest whole number (with .5 shares being rounded up) and deposit into escrow a full share of Parent Common Stock for such fractional share. The Indemnification Escrow Shares and Special Liability Escrow Shares shall be held by the Escrow Agent in book entry form. Notwithstanding the escrow of the Indemnification Escrow Shares and Special Liability Escrow Shares, cash dividends or other non-stock distributions declared and paid on such shares shall continue to be paid by Parent to the stockholders and all voting rights and all other indicia of ownership other than physical possession of the certificates representing such shares shall inure to the benefit of and be enjoyed by such stockholders. Any securities received by the Escrow Agent in respect of any Indemnification Escrow Shares and Special Liability Escrow Shares held in escrow as a result of any stock split or combination of 

  

    

 shares of Parent Common Stock, payment of a stock dividend or other stock
distribution in or on shares of Parent Common Stock or change of Parent Common
Stock into any other securities pursuant to or as a part of a merger,
consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or
liquidation of Parent, or otherwise, shall be held by the Escrow Agent as, and
shall be included within the definition of, Indemnification Escrow Shares and
Special Liability Escrow Shares, as applicable.

  

  

 (d) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) Each outstanding Warrant (as defined herein) and each outstanding Option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company\'s 1997 Stock Option Plan (the " _Company Option Plan_ "), whether or not vested or exercisable (the " _Options_ "), shall, unless such Warrant or Option shall have been exercised prior to consummation of, or shall terminate by its terms in connection with, the Merger, be assumed by Parent and shall constitute an option to acquire that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the Common Stock Exchange Ratio and the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant or Option, at a price per share (rounded to the nearest $0.001) equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant or Option divided by the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock deemed to be purchasable pursuant to such Warrant or Option; provided, however, that (i) subject to the provisions of clause (ii) below, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of such Warrant or Option shall not include any fractional shares, and, at the time of assumption of such Warrant or Option, Parent shall pay to the holder thereof as soon as practicable an amount of cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Base Price (as defined below), and (ii) in the case of any Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the Option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code. Parent shall assume the obligations of the Company under the Company Option Plan and shall comply with the terms of such plan as they apply to the Options assumed as set forth above. 

  

 (f) Holders of shares of Company Capital Stock who have complied with all the requirements for perfecting dissenters\' rights, as required under the DGCL, shall be entitled to their rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is then entitled under this Agreement and the DGCL, without interest thereon and upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares held by a stockholder who has perfected dissenter\'s rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1.8.1. 

  

 (g) If, prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company effects a subdivision of its outstanding shares into a greater number of shares, or a combination of its outstanding shares into a lesser number of shares, or reorganizes, reclassifies or otherwise changes its outstanding shares into the same or a different number of shares or other classes, or declares a dividend on its outstanding shares payable in shares of its capital stock or securities convertible into shares of its capital stock, then the Company Common Stock Exchange Ratio and the Company Preferred Stock Exchange Ratios will be adjusted appropriately so as to maintain the relative proportionate interests of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock. 

     

1.8.2 Exchange of Certificates

  

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to Mellon, the " _Exchange Agent,_ " the certificates representing the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 1.8.1(b) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and cash for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.8.3. 

  

 (b) The Exchange Agent shall mail on or prior to the Closing Date to each holder of record as of the date 10 business days prior to the Closing Date of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (and as soon as practicable to stockholders that become holders of Company Capital Stock subsequent to such date, if any), other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.8.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, by the later of (a) ten business days following the Effective Time and (b) ten business days following the surrender of such certificate, a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.8.1, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled; provided, however, that the certificates representing the Indemnification Escrow Shares and Special Liability Escrow Shares shall be retained by the Escrow Agent in book-entry form in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Special Liability Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (c) In the event that any certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the stockholder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock that such stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.8.1; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require such stockholder to provide Parent with a reasonable and customary indemnity agreement against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 (d) The shares of Parent Common Stock that each stockholder of the Company shall be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger (including the Indemnification Escrow Shares and Special Liability Escrow Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time. No interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration. If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the person requesting such exchange pay to Parent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate or certificates so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable law, including abandoned property, escheat and similar laws to the extent required under law to be so delivered. 

  

 (e) Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of 

    this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Company
Capital Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent.

  

  

1.8.3 No Fractional Shares

  

  

 No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued by virtue of the Merger, and no dividend, stock split or other distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall relate to any such fractional interest, and no such fractional interest shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder. In lieu thereof, Parent shall pay to the holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date (and in the same timely manner required for delivery of certificates of Parent Common Stock provided in Section 1.8.2), an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing price of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Base Price_ "). 

  

  

1.8.4 No Further Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights In Company Capital
Stock

  

  

 All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be forwarded to Parent and shall be canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Section 1.8, unless such certificates for Parent Common Stock have already been issued in respect of such shares in reliance upon an affidavit of loss or otherwise, in any case subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares. 

  

1.9 Stockholders\' Committee

  

 (a) Upon approval of the Merger, the stockholders of the Company shall be deemed, for themselves and their personal representatives and other successors, to have constituted and appointed, effective from and after the Effective Time, a committee of two persons initially to consist of Randolph Hood and David Costine, as their agents and attorneys-in-fact (the " _Stockholders\' Committee_ "), as contemplated by Article VIII, with full powers of substitution, for taking of all action required or permitted under this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Special Liability Escrow Agreement and any other agreement, certificate, instrument or document to be delivered by the stockholders in connection with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Special Liability Escrow Agreement, as contemplated by Article VIII, and for receiving of all directions, notices and consents and for the execution and delivery of all documents, including any amendments of any nonmaterial term or provision hereof or of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Special Liability Escrow Agreement, for the making (but only together with both members of the Stockholders\' Committee) of all determinations that may be required or that he or she deems appropriate under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Special Liability Escrow Agreement and for the execution and delivery of any agreements and releases in connection with the settlement of any dispute or claim under Article VIII, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or the Special Liability Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (b) In the event of the death, physical or mental incapacity, removal or resignation of any member of the Stockholders\' Committee or a vacancy thereon for any other reason, the remaining member of the Stockholders\' Committee shall promptly appoint a substitute and notify Parent thereof. A member of the Stockholders\' Committee may be removed by the vote of stockholders which collectively held a majority of the Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. The 

    members of the Stockholders\' Committee shall not be liable for, and shall
be indemnified by the stockholders of the Company against, all acts done or
omitted by them in connection with their duties as members of such
Stockholders\' Committee, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Stockholders\' Committee may consult with professional advisors of its
choice. The Stockholders\' Committee shall not be responsible for the
genuineness or validity of any document and shall have no liability for acting
in accordance with any written instructions given to and believed by it to
be signed by the proper parties.

  

 (c) All Committee Expenses (as defined below) incurred by the Stockholders\' Committee or its members in performing their duties and any indemnification to be provided to the Stockholders\' Committee shall be jointly and not severally borne by the stockholders of the Company, and Parent and the stockholders of the Company by approval of the Merger authorize the sale by the Escrow Agent on behalf of each of them (based on the stockholder\'s relative contribution of Escrow Shares under such agreements) as necessary to reimburse the Stockholders\' Committee for Committee Expenses; and the distribution of the net proceeds of such sale by the Escrow Agent to the members of the Stockholders\' Committee in order to reimburse the Stockholders\' Committee for Committee Expenses. " _Committee Expenses_ " means all reasonable documented expenses incurred by members of the Stockholders\' Committee in performing their duties under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Special Liability Escrow Agreement (including reasonable fees and expenses of professional advisors). Neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation, nor the Escrow Agent shall have any liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever in respect of Committee Expenses or the payment or satisfaction thereof, which shall only be paid or satisfied by recourse by the Stockholders\' Committee to the stockholders directly; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, up to $100,000 of Committee Expenses may be paid or satisfied through the release of Escrow Shares that are, by the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Special Liability Escrow Agreement, distributable thereunder to stockholders.

Furthermore, a maximum of $500,000 of Unknown Infringement Claims shall be excluded in determining whether the amount of all Losses exceeds the Threshold. 

       

 (b) With regard to the Patent Litigation, Parent agrees that attorneys\' fees and expenses up to $1,000,000 will not constitute a Loss for which Parent or any other Indemnified Party may make a Claim (the " _Claim Exclusion_ "). Other than such Claim Exclusion and subject to the further provisions this Section 8.3, the Indemnified Parties will be entitled to received indemnification for all Losses relating to the Patent Litigation. 

  

 (c) Except for Losses based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the aggregate liability of any stockholder of the Company pursuant to this Article VIII (i) for any Loss not in connection with the Patent Litigation shall be limited to the Indemnification Escrow Shares and (ii) for any Loss in connection with the Patent Litigation shall be limited to the Special Liability Escrow Shares. 

  

 (d) Losses in any case shall be net of the amount of any insurance proceeds or any indemnity or contribution actually recovered by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (e) An indemnifying party shall not be obligated to defend and hold harmless an Indemnified Party, or otherwise be liable to such party, with respect to any claims made by the Indemnified Party after the expiration of the Survival Period or other applicable time limitation described in Section 8.1, except that indemnity may be sought after the expiration of the Survival Period or other applicable time limitation if a Claim Notice (as defined in Section 8.4) shall have been delivered to the Stockholders\' Committee prior to the expiration of such time period. 

  

 (f) The indemnification obligations of the stockholders under this Article VIII shall be satisfied only by forfeiture to the applicable Indemnified Party of that portion of the Indemnification Escrow Shares or the Special Liability Escrow Shares, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII and the respective escrow agreement. The aggregate value of Claims paid by means of the forfeiture to Parent of Indemnification Escrow Shares shall be deemed to reduce the total Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 1.8. Any such claims shall be deemed to reduce the Indemnification Escrow Shares or the Special Liability Escrow Shares, as applicable, pro rata, with respect to each stockholder, as determined by reference to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock such stockholder is entitled to receive in the Merger as compared to all other stockholders. 

   

 (g) The stockholders of the Company shall not have any liability or obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any Losses resulting from the breach of any representation or warranty to the extent that Parent or Merger Sub has waived such breach in writing prior to the consummation of the Merger. 

  

8.4 Procedure for Indemnification; Claims

  

 Whenever a Claim arises for indemnification under this Article VIII, the parties shall comply with the notice and other procedures specified in the applicable escrow agreement. 

  

8.5 Remedies; Specific Performance

  

 (a) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the other parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto agrees that until and through Closing, the other parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof (including the indemnification provisions hereof) in any competent court having jurisdiction over the parties, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity. Following the Closing, subject to Section 8.5(b), any dispute under this Agreement or the Operative Documents shall be settled by binding arbitration in Seattle, Washington in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.8 

     (b) Notwithstanding Section 8.5(a), following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of this Article VIII are the sole and exclusive
remedy, contractual or otherwise, of any party to this Agreement for a breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein and shall
preclude assertion by the Indemnified Parties of any other right or the
seeking of any other remedies against the Company or the stockholders of the
Company with respect thereto, and any disputes under the Special Liability
Escrow Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement shall be resolved by
arbitration as provided therein.

9.3 Severability

  

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party.

9.4 Entire Agreement

  

 This Agreement, the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement and the other Operative Documents constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

  

9.5 Assignment

  

 This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise; provided, however, that Merger Sub\'s rights and obligations may be assigned to and assumed by Parent or any other corporation wholly owned (directly or through intermediate wholly owned subsidiaries) by Parent provided, that in such event, Parent shall unconditionally guarantee the full payment and performance of all obligations of such assignee. 

  

9.6 Parties in Interest

  

 This Agreement shall be binding on and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal representatives and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer on any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

9.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue

  

 This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Washington applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that state. Subject to Section 8.5(a), the parties irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington in connection with any action relating to this Agreement. 

   9.8 Arbitration Procedure

  

 All claims and disputes under this Agreement or the other Operative Documents arising after the Closing (other than claims or disputes under the Special Liability Escrow Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, which shall be resolved by arbitration as provided therein) shall be settled in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA Rules_ "). Each of Parent and the Stockholders\' Committee shall designate one arbitrator within 30 days after delivery of a written notice by either such party to the other such party (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). Parent and the Stockholders\' Committee shall cause such designated arbitrators mutually to agree upon and designate a third arbitrator; provided, however, that (i) failing such agreement within 70 days of delivery of the Dispute Notice, the third arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules and (ii) if either the Stockholders\' Committee or Parent fails to timely designate an arbitrator, the dispute shall be resolved by the one arbitrator timely designated. One half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be paid by the Stockholders\' Committee and the other half shall be paid by Parent. The Stockholders\' Committee and Parent shall cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated pursuant hereto within 60 days after the appointment of the last arbitrator. The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be furnished to the Stockholders\' Committee and Parent in writing and shall constitute the conclusive determination of the issue in question binding upon the Stockholders\' Committee and Parent, and shall not be contested by any of them. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators\' decision. 

  

9.9 Counterparts

  

 This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. To expedite the process of entering into this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that Transmitted Copies of this Agreement will be equivalent to original documents until such time as original documents are completely executed and delivered. " _Transmitted Copies_ " will mean copies that are reproduced or transmitted via photocopy, facsimile or other process of complete and accurate reproduction and transmission.
