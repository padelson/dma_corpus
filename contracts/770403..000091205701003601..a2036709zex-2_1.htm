set forth in Article&nbsp;VIII. Fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall not be deposited in escrow. In lieu thereof, each stockholder shall round such fractional share to the nearest whole
number (with .5 shares being rounded up) and deposit into escrow a full share of Parent Common Stock for such fractional share. The Indemnification Escrow Shares and Special Liability Escrow Shares

Parent Common Stock deemed to be purchasable pursuant to such Warrant or Option; provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;subject to the provisions of clause&nbsp;(ii) below, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of such Warrant or Option shall not include any fractional shares, and, at the time of assumption of such Warrant or Option, Parent shall pay to

outstanding shares into a lesser number of shares, or reorganizes, reclassifies or otherwise changes its outstanding shares into the same or a different number of shares or other classes, or declares
a dividend on its outstanding shares payable in shares of its capital stock or securities convertible into shares of its capital stock, then the Company Common Stock Exchange Ratio and the Company
Preferred Stock Exchange Ratios will be adjusted appropriately so as to maintain the relative proportionate interests of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and the holders of shares of

for the purposes of considering approval of the Merger, either at a special meeting of stockholders to be held no later than 35&nbsp;days after the declaration of effectiveness of the
Form&nbsp;S-4 or by their sooner execution of a written consent. The Company and Parent each will promptly provide all information relating to its respective business or operations

responsible for any statement, information or omission in the S-4 and the Stockholder Materials relating to it or its affiliates based on written information furnished by it. The Company

other form as may be required by the Nasdaq National Market) from and after the Closing and otherwise in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq National Market. </FONT></P>

the Securities Act, pursuant to a registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-4, which shall be effective as of the Closing. As a result, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the
Merger will be freely tradable, without restriction under the Securities Act, other than those restrictions imposed on affiliates of the Company pursuant to Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act.
Parent agrees to use its best efforts to cause such registration statement with respect to the shares comprising the Merger Consideration to remain effective as of the Effective Date, and to prepare
and file with the SEC such amendments to such registration statement and amendments or supplements to the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the sale of Parent Common Stock at the Closing. For so long as any shares of Parent Common Stock issued in connection with the Merger remain subject to
Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act, Parent agrees to use its best efforts to timely file all required reports under the Exchange Act, and otherwise satisfy the requirements of Rule&nbsp;144(c)
under the Securities Act. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement, the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement and the other Operative Documents constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.5 Assignment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise; provided, however, that Merger Sub's rights and obligations may be assigned to and
assumed by Parent or any other corporation wholly owned (directly or through intermediate wholly owned subsidiaries) by Parent provided, that in such event, Parent shall unconditionally guarantee the

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.8 Arbitration Procedure  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All claims and disputes under this Agreement or the other Operative Documents arising after the Closing (other than claims or disputes under the Special
Liability Escrow Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, which shall be resolved by arbitration as provided therein) shall be settled in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>AAA Rules</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Each of Parent and the Stockholders' Committee shall designate one arbitrator
within 30&nbsp;days after delivery of a written notice by either such party to the other such party (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Dispute Notice</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Parent and the
Stockholders' Committee shall cause such designated arbitrators mutually to agree upon and designate a third arbitrator; provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;failing such agreement within 70&nbsp;days
of delivery of the Dispute Notice, the third arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules and (ii)&nbsp;if either the Stockholders' Committee or Parent fails to timely designate an
arbitrator, the dispute shall be resolved by the one arbitrator timely designated. One half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be paid by the Stockholders' Committee and the other half
shall be paid by Parent. The Stockholders' Committee and Parent shall cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated pursuant hereto within 60&nbsp;days after the appointment of the
last arbitrator. The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be furnished to the Stockholders' Committee and Parent in writing and shall constitute the conclusive determination of the
issue in question binding upon the Stockholders' Committee and Parent, and shall not be contested by any of them. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking
enforcement of the arbitrators' decision. </FONT></P>

counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. To expedite the process of
entering into this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that Transmitted Copies of this Agreement will be equivalent to original documents until such time as
original documents are completely executed and delivered. "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Transmitted Copies</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" will mean copies that are reproduced or transmitted via photocopy,
facsimile or other process of complete and accurate reproduction and transmission. </FONT></P>
