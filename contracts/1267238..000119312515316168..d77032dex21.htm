33 Section 2.06. _Determination of Final Closing Statement_.

 

(a) Within 120 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Subject Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth (i) a pro forma consolidating balance sheet of the Business (including
the Transferred Companies) as of the Effective Time setting forth, in columns
included under the heading "Legal Entities To Be Sold," the assets and
liabilities of the Transferred Companies as of the Effective Time; and (ii)
estimated pro forma balance sheets as of the Effective Time setting forth, in
the column thereof titled "AEB Items to be Transferred," the assets and
liabilities of, or allocable pursuant to the Specified Accounting Principles
to, each of the Ceding Companies that, as of the Effective Time, were
transferred to or assumed by the U.S. Branch and SLHIC at the Closing
pursuant to the Transaction Agreements, including a calculation of the USIC
Required Asset Value and the USLICONY Required Asset Value as of the Effective
Time; and (iii) Purchasers determination of the Agreed Value and the
fair market value, as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior
to the Closing Date, of each of the Eligible Assets included in the USIC Final
Asset Portfolio or the USLICONY Final Asset Portfolio. The Subject Closing
Statement shall be (A) prepared in accordance with the Specified Accounting
Principles and (B) in the same format as the Reference Pro Forma Statement and
the Reference Investment Portfolio Schedule, except that the Subject Closing
Statement need not include information with respect to assets and liabilities
not transferred to or assumed by Purchaser or its Affiliates at the Effective
Time.

 

(b) In connection with their review of the Estimated Closing Statement, the
Subject Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement (if any), Purchaser
and Seller, as applicable, and their respective Representatives shall be
permitted reasonable access to review the other partys working papers and any
working papers of the other partys independent accountants that relate
to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement, the Subject Closing
Statement or the Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, as well as all the
Books and Records and other relevant information relating to the operations
and finances of the Business with respect to the period up to the Closing
Date, and each party shall make reasonably available the individuals in its or
its Affiliates employ (including the Chief Financial Officer of such party
and its ultimate parent company, if applicable) as the reviewing party or any
of its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the independent accountants of the other party shall not be obligated to make
any working papers available to the reviewing party unless and until such
reviewing party has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants; and each party shall
otherwise cooperate in good faith with the other party to arrive at a final
determination of the Final Closing Statement.

(c) Each party shall, following the Closing through the date that the Final
Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the parties in accordance with
the last sentence of _Section 2.06(g)_, take all actions necessary to
maintain and preserve all accounting books, records, policies and procedures
on which the Subject Closing Statement are based or on which the Final Closing
Statement are to be based (except that Seller shall have no such obligation
with respect to Books and Records transferred to Purchaser hereunder) so as
not to impede or delay the final determination of the amounts set forth
therein.

 



34 (d) If Seller disagrees with the Subject Closing Statement (including any
amount or computation set forth therein), Seller may, on or prior to the last
day of the 45-day period immediately following Sellers receipt of the Subject
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), deliver a notice to Purchaser
setting forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the
basis for Sellers disagreement therewith (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ");
provided that Seller may not, in any such Notice of Disagreement, take any
position that constitutes a deviation from the Specified Accounting
Principles. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth, with respect to each
disputed item, Sellers position as to the correct amount or computation that
should have been included in the Subject Closing Statement. If Seller does
not deliver a Notice of Disagreement with respect to the Subject Closing
Statement to Purchaser by the end of the Review Period, the Subject Closing
Statement shall become final and binding on the parties. 

(e) During the 10 Business Days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any
disagreement that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. If Seller and Purchaser reach agreement with respect
to any such disagreements, Purchaser shall revise the Subject
Closing Statement to reflect such agreement in a manner that is mutually
acceptable to Purchaser and Seller.

(f) If, at the end of such 10 Business Day period, Seller and Purchaser have
been unable to resolve all disagreements that they may have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, then Seller and Purchaser
shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Subject Closing Statement marked to
indicate those line items that are in dispute) to Ernst and Young LLP or, if
such firm is unwilling or unable to serve, another independent certified
public accounting firm in the United States of international recognition
mutually agreeable to Seller and Purchaser and that is not the auditor or
independent accounting firm of any of the parties (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "), to make a determination with respect to all
matters in dispute.

(g) Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Independent Accountant to render a determination within thirty (30) days
after the submission of such matters to the Independent Accountant or as soon
as practicable thereafter. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) after
the Independent Accountants engagement, each submit to the Independent
Accountant their respective computations of the disputed items identified
in the Notice of Disagreement and information, arguments and support for
their respective positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such
materials to the other party. Each party shall then be given an opportunity to
supplement the information, arguments and support included in its initial
submission with one additional submission to respond to any arguments or
positions taken by the other party in such other partys initial submission,
which supplemental information shall be submitted to the Independent
Accountant (with a copy thereof to the other party) within five Business Days
after the first date on which both parties have submitted their respective
initial submissions to the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant
shall thereafter be permitted to request additional or clarifying information
from the parties, and each of the parties shall cooperate and shall cause
their Representatives to cooperate with such requests of the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall determine, based
solely on the

 



35  materials so presented by the parties and upon information received in
response to such requests for additional or clarifying information and not by
independent review, only those issues set forth in the Notice of Disagreement
that remain in dispute and shall render a written report to Seller and
Purchaser in which the Independent Accountant shall, after considering all
matters set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, determine what adjustments,
if any, should be made to the amounts and computations set forth in the
Subject Closing Statement solely as to the disputed items. Such written report
shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the determination of the
Independent Accountant with respect to each of the disputed line items
specified in the Notice of Disagreement and the revisions, if any, to be made
to the Subject Closing Statement resulting therefrom, together with supporting
calculations. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination
shall be made in accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles and the
terms of this Agreement and, if not in accordance with the position of either
Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the
lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement or
Purchaser in the Subject Closing Statement with respect to such disputed line
item. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not review
any line items or make any determination with respect to any matter other than
those matters in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The
Independent Accountants final written determination shall, absent fraud or
manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon Seller and Purchaser, shall
not be subject to review by a court or other tribunal and shall have the same
force and effect as an arbitration award governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et. seq. The " _Final Closing Statement_ " means the Subject
Closing Statement as made final and binding either pursuant to _Section
2.06(d)_ or after it has been modified to reflect any revisions thereto made
through the mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller or through the
determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant to _Section 2.06(e)_
and/or this _Section 2.06(g)_.

satisfied notwithstanding the fact that it has not been satisfied with respect
to the other; and

 



     | (iii) | if (A) the USIC Ceding Commission or the USLICONY Ceding

_Section 2.07(c)(iii)_ and Purchaser will thereafter have no further
obligation to cause SLHIC to make any payments to USLICONY pursuant to this
_Section 2.07(c)(iii)_. 
---|---|--- 
 



37 In the event that the Initial Conditions are not satisfied as of the Closing

USLICONY Ceding Commission is reduced as contemplated above, then following
the Closing and until the Specified Date, (A) Purchaser shall continue to use
reasonable best efforts to, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to,
cause at least one of the Secondary Conditions to be satisfied and (B)

Transferred Companies after the Closing) under the Specified Agreements.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this letter agreement, in no event
will any Person be obligated to make any payment, whether to the Specified
Person, any of its Affiliates, or otherwise, in connection with the
obligations set forth herein, other than obligations arising under the express
terms of the Specified Agreements, the responsibility for which shall be

the economic cost of such change in terms, shall be borne 50% by the Purchaser
Insurers and 50% by USIC and USLICONY; _provided_ , that (x) the
maximum aggregate liability of Seller and its Affiliates under this paragraph
will not exceed the sum of the USIC Ceding Commission Adjustment Amount and
the USLICONY Ceding Commission Adjustment Amount and (y) the fair value of the
economic cost of such change in terms shall be determined by mutual agreement
of Purchaser and Seller, each of which shall act reasonably and in good faith
in the determination and negotiation of such fair value; _provided further_
that, if the parties are unable to agree on such fair value, the parties
shall submit the dispute to a nationally recognized independent third party
valuation firm that is reasonably acceptable to both parties to determine such
fair value. In the event that any such dispute is submitted to an independent
third party valuation firm pursuant to the previous sentence, each of
Purchaser and Seller shall promptly submit to such firm a written report
setting forth its proposed determination of such fair value, such firm
shall adopt one of such proposals as the fair value of such economic cost
(and may not select or require any alternative proposal or valuation), and
such decision shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder.

 

The adjustments to the USIC Ceding Commission and the USLICONY Ceding
Commission described in this _Section 2.07_ shall be reflected in the

interfere with the business operations of Purchaser or its Affiliates.

Contract of confidentiality owing to a third-party or jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , that the party
contemplated to provide access shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

laws, such party has given the other party written notice of such potential
disclosure and, to the extent reasonably requested by such other party,
cooperated with such other party in

that could otherwise prevent, impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any
material respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
and shall consent to and

 



64  comply with any condition imposed by any Governmental Authority on its grant
of any such permit, order, consent, approval, or authorization, other than any
Burdensome Condition. Each of the parties shall provide to the other party
copies of all applications or other communications to Governmental Authorities
in connection with this Agreement in advance of the filing or submission
thereof; _provided_ , in no event will any party be required to disclose to
the other party any Trade Secrets in respect of itself or any of its
Representatives, or any personally identifiable information or personal
financial information with respect to any of its Representatives who are
natural persons.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, within 20 Business Days
after the date hereof, (i) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to, file with all applicable Insurance Regulators and the
California DMHC the filings and requests for approval listed in _Section
4.04_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule and (ii) Seller shall, and shall
cause its applicable Affiliates to, file with all applicable Insurance
Regulators the filings and requests for approval listed in _Section 3.05_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule under the heading "Approvals Required to be
Obtained by Seller and its Affiliates", in each case which filings and
requests shall be complete and shall include all required exhibits. Purchaser
and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information
concerning themselves, their respective Affiliates, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the preparation of any statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on their behalf to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements;
_provided_ , in no event will any party be required to disclose to the other
party any Trade Secrets in respect of itself or any of its Representatives,
or any personally identifiable information or personal financial information
of any of its Representatives who are natural persons. A reasonable time prior
to furnishing any written materials to any Insurance Regulator or
the California DMHC in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, the filing party shall furnish the other party with a
copy thereof, and such other party shall have a reasonable opportunity to
provide comments thereon, which comments shall be considered by the filing
party in good faith; _provided_ , in no event will any party be required to
disclose to the other party any Trade Secrets in respect of itself or any of
its Representatives, or any personally identifiable information or personal
financial information with respect to any of its Representatives who are
natural persons. Each party shall give to the other party prompt written
notice if it or any of its Affiliates receives any notice or
other communication from any Insurance Regulator, the California DMHC or
other Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements and, in the case of any such notice or
communication that is in writing, shall promptly furnish the other party with
a copy thereof. If any Governmental Authority requires that a hearing be held
in connection with any such approval, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange for such hearing to be held promptly after the notice that
such hearing is required has been received by such party. Each party shall
give to the other party reasonable prior written notice of the time and place
when any meetings, telephone calls, or other conferences may be held by it
with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (other than telephone calls
regarding routine administrative matters), and the other party shall have the
right to have a representative or representatives attend or otherwise
participate in any such meeting, telephone call, or other

 



65  conference unless the relevant Governmental Authority does not consent to
attendance or participation by such other partys representative or such
attendance or participation is prohibited by Applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Purchaser nor
Seller shall be obligated to take or refrain from taking or to agree to it,
its Affiliates or (solely in the case of Purchaser) any of the Transferred
Companies or any of their respective Representatives taking or refraining from
taking any action or to permit or suffer to exist any restriction, condition,
limitation or requirement which, individually or together with all other such
actions, restrictions, conditions, limitations or requirements, would
constitute a Burdensome Condition. As used in this Agreement, " _Burdensome
Condition_ " means any arrangement, condition or restriction (i) in the case
of Purchaser, (A) to sell or hold separate or agree to sell, divest or
discontinue, before or after the Closing Date, any properties, assets,
businesses or licenses of Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred
Companies that are material to Purchaser and its Affiliates, taken as a whole,
or to the Business, as applicable, or (B) that otherwise is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, operations or results of operations of
Purchaser and its Affiliates, taken as a whole; and (ii) in the case of
Seller, would require Seller to provide any guarantee or incur any liability
with respect to the Transferred Companies after the Closing Date, or restrict
the ability of Seller or any of its Affiliates to conduct their respective
businesses after the Closing Date.

 

(d) Neither this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt to sell,
transfer, assign, convey or deliver any asset, property, Contract or right
that: (i) by its terms or by Applicable Law is not transferable or assignable,
as applicable, without the consent or waiver of any third party (other than a
Governmental Authority); and (ii) with respect to which such consent or
waiver has not been obtained (each, a " _Non-Assignable Item_ "); _provided_
that this _Section 5.06(d)_ shall not affect whether any such asset,
property, Contract or right will be deemed to be a "Transferred Asset" or
"Assigned Contract" under this Agreement. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
Closing, any consent or waiver from any third party (other than a
Governmental Authority) that is required for Seller or its applicable
Affiliates to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver the Transferred
Assets and Assigned Contracts to Purchaser or to provide the services to be
provided under the Transition Services Agreement. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to, cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates at
Sellers request to assist Seller and its Affiliates in obtaining such
consents or waivers. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own and its
Affiliates internal costs to obtain such consents and waivers, and the costs
payable to third parties for obtaining such consents and waivers shall
be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. If any such consent or waiver
cannot be obtained prior to the Closing, then, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and the terms of any relevant Contracts with third parties, as
an additional service to be provided by Seller under the Transition Services
Agreement for the applicable term thereof: (A) the Non-Assignable Items
subject thereto and affected thereby shall be held, from and after the
Closing, by Seller or its applicable Affiliate in trust for the benefit of
Purchaser, and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for
Purchasers account; (B) Purchaser shall timely pay, perform or otherwise
discharge (in accordance with the respective terms and subject to the
respective conditions thereof, and in the name of Seller or its applicable
Affiliate) all of the

 



66  covenants and obligations of Seller or its applicable Affiliate incurred
after the Closing with respect to such Non-Assignable Item; (C) Seller shall
and shall cause its applicable Affiliate to take or cause to be taken such
actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser may reasonably request so as to
provide Purchaser with the benefits of such Non-Assignable Items and to effect
the collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable
under such Non-Assignable Item, and shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all
money or other consideration received by it in respect of such Non-Assignable
Item; and (D) Purchaser and Seller shall mutually cooperate to provide any
other alternative arrangements as may be reasonably required to implement the
purpose and intent of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements so
that Purchaser and its Affiliates will have access to the rights and
benefits contemplated by such Non-Assignable Item from and after the Closing.
If and when such consent or waiver is obtained, Seller shall, and shall cause
its applicable Affiliates to, sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver such
Non-Assignable Item to Purchaser for no additional consideration.

Section 5.07. _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, including _Section
5.06_:

 



     | (i) | each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, execute such documents and other papers and perform such
further acts as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof
and the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction
Agreements; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | each such party shall, at or prior to the Closing Date, use
its reasonable best efforts to fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the
conditions precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements, including the execution and
delivery of any documents, certificates, instruments or other papers and the
taking of any other actions that are reasonably necessary for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction
Agreements. 
---|---|--- 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on and after the
Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, take all reasonable actions and execute any additional
documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably
necessary to carry out any of the provisions hereof, so as to put Purchaser
and its Affiliates in full possession and operating control of the Business
and to effect fully the separation of the Business from Seller and its
Affiliates.

 

Section 5.08. _Privacy and Data Security Compliance; Use of Information_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement to the contrary, none of Seller, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to take any action that would violate
or conflict with, and each such Person shall comply with, all Privacy and
Data Security Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Seller and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
ensure that all Personal Data

 



67  about holders of AEB Policies or other individuals is used, shared,
accessed, stored, transmitted, disclosed, or otherwise processed in a manner
(including the scope of information) that complies with, and facilitates each
partys compliance with, Privacy and Data Security Laws. For avoidance of
doubt, any Personal Data relating to holders of insurance policies accessed by
or disclosed to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to Purchasers confidentiality obligations under _Section
5.04_.

Section 5.09.  _Reinsurance Contracts_.

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate,
work in good faith and use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Seller to) obtain, with respect to each of the assumed Reinsurance Contracts
set forth on _Section 5.09_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Specified Assumed Treaties_ ") and the corresponding Specified Trust
Agreement(s), the consent of the cedent under each such Specified Assumed
Treaty to the novation, subject to the occurrence of the Closing and
effective as of the Effective Time, of such Specified Assumed Treaty and the
transfer of (through the change of the grantor under) the corresponding
Specified Trust Account(s) to the U.S. Branch and the release of USIC by such
cedent under such Specified Assumed Treaty, in each case pursuant to the
terms of an Assumed Reinsurance Novation Agreement or pursuant to other terms
that may be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller; _provided_ , in no
event shall Seller agree to any amendment to the terms and conditions of any
Specified Assumed Treaty or Specified Trust Agreement (whether to become
effective prior to, upon or after such novation) without Purchasers written
consent, except as otherwise permitted under  _Section 5.01_. If such
consent is obtained prior to the Closing Date with respect to any Specified
Assumed Treaty, such Specified Assumed Treaty and Specified Trust Account(s)
shall be novated to the U.S. Branch at the Closing and effective as of the
Effective Time pursuant to an Assumed Reinsurance Novation Agreement or
pursuant to such other terms that are reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
Seller, and USIC shall be released by the cedent thereunder as set forth in
such Assumed Reinsurance Novation Agreement or pursuant to such other agreed
terms. If the consent of the applicable cedent with respect to any Specified
Assumed Treaty and corresponding Specified Trust Account(s) is not obtained
prior to the Closing Date, then: (i) the USIC Coinsurance Agreement will
provide that the liabilities assumed by USIC pursuant to such Specified
Assumed Treaty will be retroceded to Purchaser Insurer pursuant to such
agreement on a modified coinsurance basis as reflected in the form of USIC
Coinsurance and Modified Coinsurance Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
; and (ii) the parties shall, to the extent practicable, continue to
cooperate, work together in good faith and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent after the Closing in accordance with
the terms of the USIC Coinsurance Agreement. If any such consent is received
after the Closing then, as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter,
the applicable Specified Assumed Treaty shall be novated to Purchaser Insurer
pursuant to an Assumed Reinsurance Novation Agreement or pursuant to other
terms that may be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller, or as
otherwise provided by the USIC Coinsurance Agreement. Each of the parties
shall bear its own costs in connection with obtaining the consent of the
applicable cedent to the novation of any Specified Assumed Treaty; _provided_
that no party shall have any obligation to make any payment to any cedent
under any Specified Assumed Treaty or any other Person in connection with
obtaining any such consent. The terms of this _Section 5.09_ shall be subject
to the 

 



68  terms of _Section 2.07(c)_, in the event of a conflict between the terms of
this _Section 5.09_ and the terms of _Section 2.07(c)_, which shall control
with respect to the treatment of the Specified Agreements.

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing, if and when requested by
Purchaser, Seller shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of any counterparty to a Reinsurance Contract (other than a Specified
Assumed Treaty) necessary or advisable to novate such Reinsurance Contract
(and any rights in any trust or other agreement or instrument providing
security with respect to such Reinsurance Contract) to a Purchaser Insurer, or
(ii) cause the applicable AEB Company to terminate, or recapture risks in
respect of the Business ceded under, any Reinsurance Contract, pursuant to
the terms thereof or otherwise, in each case, effective at or after the
Effective Time, and subject to the occurrence of the Closing. Purchaser shall
be responsible for payment of any amounts payable to any counterparty to a
Reinsurance Contract in connection with the foregoing, provided that Seller
shall not incur any Liability for any such amounts without Purchasers prior
written consent. If the requisite consent for the novation of a Reinsurance
Contract to a Purchaser Insurer is obtained prior to the Closing and if so
elected by Purchaser, Purchaser shall cause the applicable Purchaser Insurer
to, and Seller shall cause the applicable AEB Company to, enter into
instruments of novation prior to or at the Closing and effective upon the
Effective Time, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller and
Purchaser, to effect the novation of the applicable Reinsurance Contract;
_provided_ that none of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies) shall be required to pay or become obligated to pay any amounts as
a result of such novation that would not be assumed by a Purchaser Insurer
under a Coinsurance Agreement or otherwise paid by Purchaser or its
Affiliates. In the event any amount is paid by any reinsurer to Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with the termination of, or recapture of risks
under, any ceded Reinsurance Contract, other than amounts paid to
a Transferred Company or to the extent included in the Final Closing
Statement as a receivable retained by Seller and its Affiliates, Seller shall
or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to pay such amount to the applicable
Purchaser Insurer at or as promptly as practicable after the Closing.

Section 5.10. _Non-Solicitation of Employees_.

 

(a) For a period of 24 months following the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall,
whether directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ or otherwise
contract for the services of (i) any Transferred Employee or (ii) any
director, officer or employee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with whom
Seller and its Affiliates first had contact or who (or whose performance)
became known to Seller and its Affiliates in connection with Purchasers
evaluation of the transactions contemplated by, the due diligence Purchaser
conducted in connection with, or the negotiation of, the Transaction
Agreements, or the receipt of services under the Transition Services
Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.10(a)_ shall prohibit
Seller or any of its Affiliates from engaging in general solicitations not
directed at such Persons or from soliciting, employing or contracting for the
services of (A) any such Person whose employment with or engagement by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) has
been involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate or who
has otherwise ceased to be employed or engaged by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Transferred 

 



69  Companies) for a period of at least six months prior to the first contact by
Seller or any of its Affiliates with such Person or (B) any Transferred
Employee who was, prior to the Closing Date, a Seller Employee and whose
employment with or engagement by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Companies) has been involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or
its applicable Affiliate.

 

(b) For a period of 24 months following the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Seller, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall,

the services of any director, officer or employee of Seller or any of its
Affiliates with whom Purchaser and its Affiliates first had contact or who
(or whose performance) became known to Purchaser and its Affiliates in
connection with the evaluation of the transactions contemplated by, the due
diligence Purchaser conducted in connection with, or the negotiation of, the
Transaction Agreements, or the performance of services under the Transition
Services Agreement, other than any Transferred Employee; _provided_ , that
nothing in this _Section 5.10(b)_ shall prohibit Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the AEB Companies) from engaging in general
solicitations not directed at such Persons or from soliciting, employing or
contracting for the services of any such Person whose employment with or
engagement by Seller and its Affiliates has been involuntarily terminated by
Seller or its applicable Affiliate or who has otherwise ceased to be employed
or engaged by Seller or any of its Affiliates for a period of at least six
months prior to the first contact by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with
such Person.

arrangement or similar business combination involving any Restricted Entity
with any Competing Person or (B) the acquisition of any Competing Person or

71 Section 5.12. _Use of Names_.

 

(a) Prior to or at the Closing, the Transferred Companies shall transfer any
and all right, title, or interest, including all associated goodwill, which

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to identify all Commingled Contracts and, promptly after

any Commingled Contract, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate in good faith with Purchasers
efforts to cause the counterparty to any such Commingled Contract to enter
into a new contract with Purchaser or its designee, effective as of the
Closing or at the end of the relevant transition service period, if

_provided_ that Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to pay any
amounts to any third party, or otherwise to incur any expense, in connection
with any efforts to obtain any such New Contract.

and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, upon Purchasers request,
reasonably cooperate in good faith with Purchasers efforts to cause such
counterparty to enter into a New Contract; _provided_ that Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be required to pay any amounts to any third party, or
otherwise to incur any expense, in connection with any efforts to obtain any
such New Contract

 

(c) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own and its Affiliates
internal costs with respect to this _Section 5.19_. All third party fees,
costs and expenses incurred under or in connection with this _Section 5.19_
shall be borne by Purchaser. Any license or services fees due with respect to
any New Contract shall be borne by Purchaser.

 



74 Section 5.20. _Transition Matters_. Promptly after the date hereof, and in any
event within fifteen (15) days thereafter, Seller and Purchaser shall appoint
a transition team to:

(a) cooperate in good faith to develop a plan for separating the Business
from the businesses of Seller and its retained Affiliates so as to minimize
the adverse impact of such separation on each partys businesses; and

 

(b) review, revise and update, where appropriate, the schedules to the
Transaction Agreements between the date hereof and the Closing, with any such
mutually agreed upon revised and updated schedules to replace the
corresponding schedules attached to the form of Transaction Agreements.

 

Section 5.21. _Separation of IT Systems and Data_. As soon as practicable
after the date hereof, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Companies) to, at Sellers expense, in compliance
with Applicable Laws, separate logically and physically the Sellers IT
Systems from the Transferred Companies IT Systems, in such a manner that the
Transferred Companies IT Systems are not accessible to Seller and its
retained Affiliates and the Sellers IT Systems are not accessible to
Purchaser or the Transferred Companies, except as and to the extent such
access is necessary for the provision or receipt of services pursuant to the
Transaction Agreements or as otherwise set forth herein, and shall take all
reasonable precautions necessary to safeguard the confidentiality of any
confidential information (including all data) of the Transferred Companies,
including, at a minimum, those precautions taken by Seller to protect its own
confidential information of a similar nature. In the event Purchaser requests
changes to be made between the date hereof and Closing to such IT Systems or
data or the separation process that Seller would not otherwise have to, or
choose to implement, and Purchaser and Seller mutually agree in writing on the
terms and cost of such changes, Seller shall make such changes, which shall
be at Purchasers expense. In addition, from and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall bear the cost of integrating such IT Systems, or converting such data so
that it is compatible with the technology systems of Purchaser and its
Affiliates.

Section 5.22. _Ceding Company Change of Control_. If at any time between the
date hereof and the five (5)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller or
any applicable Affiliate of Seller enters into a non-disclosure agreement with
respect to a business transaction that would result in any Ceding Company
ceasing to be a Subsidiary of Seller (a " _Ceding Company Change of Control_
"), then Seller shall notify Purchaser of entry into such agreement in writing
as promptly as practicable thereafter. Seller shall furnish to Purchaser a
copy of any "Form A" or similar application that has been filed during such
period with the Insurance Regulator of the applicable Ceding Companys
jurisdiction of domicile with respect to any proposed Ceding Company Change of
Control as promptly as practicable, and in any case within five (5) Business
Days after such application has been filed. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, keep confidential any information provided to
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.22_, including the fact that any
Ceding Company Change of Control is being negotiated and any information
included in such "Form A" application.

 



75 ARTICLE VI.

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 6.01. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall, not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, extend offers of employment (" _Transfer Offers_ ") to all then-current
Employees. _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
list of current Employees and Transferred Company Employees as of September 8,
2015 using the format of the Data Room file titled "Census as of 7 28
2015.xls", with additional columns for each such Employees and Transferred
Company Employees (in each case as of the date hereof) (i) recognized years
of service, (ii) cash severance entitlement (without regard to any
outplacement or COBRA premium offsets), (iii) job title, (iv) legal first
name, (v) legal last name, (vi) home address line #1, (vii) home address line
#2 (if applicable), (viii) home municipality/town, (ix) home state, (x) home
zip code, (xi) date of birth, (xii) supervisor name, (xiii) leave status,
(xiv) citizenship status description, (xv) visa identification number, (xvi)
visa type name, (xvii) visa issued date, (xviii) visa expiration date, (xix)
work email address, (xx) work area code, (xxi) work phone number, (xxii) work
phone extension, (xxiii) telecommuter status, (xxiv) AEB Division, (xxv) AEB
Department, (xxvi) frequency for actual rate of pay, (xxvii) base salary and
(xxviii) target bonus opportunity. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in
any event within 15 days after the date hereof, Seller shall supplement
_Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to provide as of the date
hereof, with respect to each Employee and each Transferred Company Employee,
(I) years of service under the Seller 401(k) Plan as of December 31, 2015
(including the 2015 calendar year), (II) hours of service under the Seller
401(k) Plan in calendar year 2016, and (III) earned but unused paid time-off,
and such supplemental information, once provided, shall be deemed to be
a part of _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for all
purposes hereunder. Seller shall be entitled to update _Section 6.01(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule periodically prior to the Closing Date to
reflect any new hires, transfers, resignations and other employment additions
and terminations of Employees and Transferred Company Employees which may have
occurred subsequent to the date hereof in the ordinary course of business of
the Business and in compliance with _Section 5.01(h)_. No later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser an updated version of _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule with information updated as of the nearest practicable date. In
addition, no later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser a further updated copy of _Section 6.01(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule with information as of the Closing Date. Each time
that Seller provides a version of _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule to Purchaser, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a separate list of
the social security numbers of the Employees and Transferred Company
Employees matched to their respective individual employee identifier codes (as
such identifiers are used in _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule).

 

(b) The Transfer Offers shall set forth the proposed terms of employment (or
service) for the then-current Employees, including (i) base salary (or wages)
no less than the base salary (or wages) as set forth on _Section 6.01(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) base salary (or wages) and target
incentive compensation opportunities that is no less in the aggregate than
the

 



76  base salary (or wages) and target incentive compensation opportunities
provided to such Employee as set forth on _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, (iii) severance benefits that are no less than the
severance benefits provided by Seller and its Affiliates as set forth on
_Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (iv) the same employee
defined contribution pension and welfare benefits then provided to similarly-
situated employees of Purchasers U.S. group benefits business, other than
retiree medical, and (v) a job location that does not increase such employees
commute by more than 25 miles when compared to the commute from such
employees residence to the job location to which such employee reports as set
forth on _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Employment or
service, as applicable, pursuant to a Transfer Offer shall be contingent upon
such Employee being employed by (or providing on-going services with) Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each
Employee who accepts Purchasers Transfer Offer and each current Transferred
Company Employee shall be a " _Transferred Employee_ " upon the Closing Date
(or, in the case of Employees out on a short-term or long-term disability
leave or any other leave of absence on the Closing Date, the return of such
Employee to active employment no later than twelve months after the Closing
Date). Effective as of the date they become Transferred Employees (the "
_Transfer Date_ "), such Transferred Employees shall cease to be employees of
Seller and its Affiliates and shall cease any further participation in (and
shall cease to accrue benefits under) Seller Employee Benefit Plans. In the
event that an Employee does not accept an offer from Purchaser that conforms
to the terms described in this _Section 6.01(b)_, then Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) shall be prohibited from
soliciting or hiring such person to the same extent that Seller is restricted
from soliciting or hiring other individuals under _Section 5.10_.

(c) Purchaser shall, for a period of two (2) years immediately following the
Closing Date, provide each Transferred Employee with (i) base salary (or
wages) no less than the base salary (or wages) as set forth on _Section
6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) base salary (or wages)
and target incentive compensation opportunities that is no less in the
aggregate than the base salary (or wages) and target incentive compensation
opportunities provided to such Employee as set forth on _Section 6.01(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (iii) employee defined contribution pension
and welfare benefits that are the same as the benefits then provided to
similarly-situated employees of Purchasers U.S. group benefits business,
other than retiree medical, and (iv) severance benefits that are no less than
the severance benefits provided by Seller and its Affiliates as set forth on
_Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(d) As of the Closing Date, the Transferred Companies shall terminate
participation in each Seller Employee Benefit Plan, and in no event shall any
Employee or Transferred Company Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits
under such Seller Employee Benefit Plans with respect to services rendered or
compensation paid on or after the Closing Date.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) Seller
shall be solely responsible for all Liabilities arising from, related to or
based upon the termination of any Employee who is terminated by Seller or its
respective Affiliates prior to, on or after the Closing Date in the event such
Employee receives, but does not accept, a Transfer Offer from Purchaser
that complies with the requirements of _Section 6.01(b)_ (and any such
Liabilities shall be considered Excluded Benefits Liabilities for purposes of
this Agreement) and (B) Purchaser shall

  



77  be solely responsible for all Liabilities arising from, related to or based
upon the termination of any Employee and any Transferred Company Employee who
is terminated by Seller or its respective Affiliates on or after the Closing
Date in the event such employee is not offered employment or service with
Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 6.01_. The
responsibility of providing all notices required under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2109 _et seq_., or the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _WARN Act_ ") (including comparable
state, local or other Applicable Laws) and for taking all remedial measures,
including, without limitation, the payment of all amounts, penalties,
liabilities, costs and expenses if such notices are not provided, with respect
to any obligations under the WARN Act (including comparable state, local or
other Applicable Laws) arising out of or resulting from (i) any termination
of employment of any Transferred Employees by Purchaser and its Affiliates on
or after the Closing Date shall be borne by Purchaser and (ii) any termination
of employment of any Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee for
any reason shall be borne by Seller.

(f) Purchaser shall permit each Transferred Employee participating in each
Seller Employee Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan with a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_") to effect, and Purchaser agrees to
cause its defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Purchaser
401(k) Plan_ ") to accept, in accordance with Applicable Law, a "direct
rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her
account balances (including earnings thereon through the date of transfer and
promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) under the Seller 401(k)
Plan if (i) such rollover to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan is elected in
accordance with Applicable Law by such Transferred Employee and (ii) if his or
her account balance includes a promissory note evidencing an outstanding
loan, such rollover to Purchaser 401(k) Plan is effected by a deadline and
under procedures to be mutually determined by Purchaser and Seller in
coordination with the record-keepers of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan and the
Seller 401(k) Plan. Seller shall cause all unvested balances of the
Transferred Employee in the Seller 401(k) Plan to vest effective upon the
Closing Date.

 

(g) Seller shall retain responsibility for all claims incurred by Transferred
Employees (and their covered dependents) prior to the Transfer Date under
Seller Employee Benefit Plans which provide medical and dental coverage, life
and accident insurance and disability coverage. Purchaser shall be responsible
for payment of medical, dental, life and accident insurance and
disability benefits for claims incurred by Transferred Employees (and their
covered dependents) on or after the Transfer Date. For purposes of this
paragraph, a claim shall be deemed to have been incurred when the medical or
other service giving rise to the claim is performed. On and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser, either itself or through an Affiliate, will be responsible
for providing continuation coverage for all Transferred Employees under COBRA
or any other Applicable Law.

 

(h) Purchaser shall assume, recognize and provide each Transferred Employee
all the Transferred Employees earned but unused paid time-off as of the
Closing Date as set forth on the final version of _Section 6.01(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule as determined under Sellers policy in effect as of
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that

 



78  Seller or one of its Affiliates is required under Applicable Law to make a
payment after the Closing Date in settlement of any such accrued paid time off
of a Transferred Employee, Purchaser shall reimburse and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates for such payment.

(i) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume any and all
obligations for and shall pay any unpaid incentive bonuses, whether the
obligation with respect thereto arises before, after or as a result of the
Closing Date, payable to any Transferred Employee pursuant to the terms of any
AEB Employee Benefit Plans or Seller Employee Benefit Plan. In no event shall
the amount of such payment by Purchaser to any Transferred Employee, if and
when they ultimately become due, be less than the amount of such incentive
bonus that was accrued as of the Closing Date with respect to such
Transferred Employee on the Final Closing Statement. From and after the
Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
responsibility for such payment obligations.

 

(j) Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make available
to the Transferred Employees a flex spending account plan for medical and
dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan established or maintained
under Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (the " _Purchaser s FSA_"),
effective as of the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, Purchaser, or one
of its Affiliate, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit the
applicable account under Purchasers FSA of each Transferred Employee
participating in the Seller Employee Benefit Plan maintained pursuant
to Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (the " _Seller s FSA_" _)_ with
an amount equal to the positive balance, if any, of such Transferred
Employees account under the Sellers FSA immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Within 30 days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall transfer (or
cause to be transferred) to Purchaser a cash payment equal to the aggregate
amount of all Transferred Employees positive balances, if any, under all of
the applicable Sellers FSAs. Provided that Purchaser has received the
transfer of any such positive balances, (i) Purchaser agrees to cause
Purchasers FSA to honor and continue through the end of the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs the elections made by each Transferred Employee
under the Sellers FSA that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims
for reimbursement by Transferred Employees, whether incurred prior to, on or
after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full pursuant to Sellers
FSA as of the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid pursuant to and under
the terms of Purchasers FSA. For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided
herein, in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates have any liability
or obligation under Purchasers FSA, nor shall Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates have any liability or obligations under Sellers FSA.

(k) Purchaser agrees to (i) provide coverage for the Transferred Employees
under its or an Affiliates employee benefit plans as of the applicable
Transfer Date, (ii) waive any pre-existing conditions (to the extent waived or
satisfied under any comparable Seller Employee Benefit Plan), waiting periods
and actively at work requirements under any such plans in which the
Transferred Employees commence to participate after the Closing Date, and
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each group health plan of
Purchaser and its Affiliates in which a Transferred Employee may participate
from and after the Closing Date to honor any expenses incurred by the
Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries under the same type of Seller
Employee Benefit Plans during the portion of the calendar year in which the
Transfer Date 

 



79  occurs for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and
maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Transferred Employees shall be given credit
for all purposes under each employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement (other than any long-term incentive plan) of Purchaser or
Purchasers Affiliate in which the Transferred Employees commence to
participate for all service with Seller as set forth in  _Section 6.01(a)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (to the extent such credit was given by the
applicable Employee Benefit Plan), except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(l) In no event shall the terms of this _Section 6.01_ be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any AEB Employee Benefit Plan or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing; or (iii)
confer upon any current or former employee or other Person any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates, preclude the ability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to terminate the employment or services of or demote the position of any
employee for any reason, or constitute or create an employment agreement with
any such Person. For greater certainty, "Affiliates" above includes,
following the Closing, the Transferred Companies.

(m) If, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) terminates the
employment of any Seller Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee at the
Closing in any circumstance under which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Companies) is required under the terms of its
employee benefit plans to make any severance payment to such Seller Employee,
Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Purchaser, for an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the amount of such required severance payment and related
payroll taxes and (ii) the amount of severance that Seller would have had to
pay to such Seller Employee had such Seller Employee been terminated by
Seller or any of its Affiliates at the Closing, which will be equal to the
amount set forth in the update to _Section 6.01_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 6.01(a)_, plus
related payroll taxes.

ARTICLE VII.

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.01. _Allocation of Consideration_. In addition to the allocation of
the Purchase Price contemplated by  _Article II_, Seller and Purchaser shall
further allocate the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to
_Article II_ , and any other applicable consideration (the " _Allocable
Amount_ ") in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code
(and the regulations promulgated thereunder) for all Tax purposes; _provided_
that such allocation for Tax purposes shall be consistent with the allocation
of the Purchase Price as contemplated by  _Article II_ and the pro forma
allocation set forth on _Exhibit M_, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law. As soon as practicable following the date on which the Final Closing
Statement becomes final and binding on the parties pursuant to _Section
2.06(g)_, Purchaser shall prepare a schedule reflecting the allocation of the
Allocable Amount and shall submit such allocation to Seller for

 



80  review. Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree on the amount and proper allocation of the Allocable Amount in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. If Seller and Purchaser have not
agreed on the allocation within 90 calendar days after the date on which the
Final Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the parties pursuant to
_Section 2.06(g)_, then Purchaser and Seller shall each have the right to
deliver notice to the other party of its intent to refer the matter for
resolution to the Independent Accountant. Purchaser and Seller will each
deliver to the other and to the Independent Accountant a notice setting forth
in reasonable detail their proposed allocations. Within 30 days after receipt
thereof, the Independent Accountant will deliver the allocation schedule and
provide a written description of the basis for its determination of the
allocations therein (such allocations, whether agreed to by Purchaser and
Seller or determined by the Independent Accountant (the " _Final Allocation_
") shall be final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and Seller and the
parties will report, and will cause their respective Affiliates to report,
the federal, state, local and other Tax consequences of the transactions,
including the filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, in a manner
consistent with such Final Allocation). One-half of all fees, costs and
expenses of retaining the Independent Accountant shall be borne by Seller and
one-half of such fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Independent
Accountant shall be borne by Purchaser. Each party will bear the costs of its
own counsel, witnesses (if any) and employees.

Section 7.02. _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser and Seller each shall bear 50% of
all Transfer Taxes applicable in connection with the transfers to Purchaser
contemplated herein. " _Transfer Taxes_ " means any and all sales, use, stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, transfer, goods and services, provincial
sales, harmonized sales, real estate, stock transfer, intangible property
transfer, personal property transfer, registration, securities transactions,
conveyance and notarial Taxes, and similar fees, Taxes and governmental
charges (together with any interest, penalty, addition to Tax, and additional
amount imposed in respect thereof) arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.03. _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(a)



     | (i) | Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Consolidated Returns that include the
Transferred Companies, regardless of when such Tax Returns are required to be
filed.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Transferred Companies for
taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date and that are required
to be filed prior to the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions)
other than Tax Returns described in _Section 7.03(a)(i)_. 
---|---|--- 
 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all other Tax Returns for or with respect to the Transferred
Companies for taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date that are
not described in _Section 7.03(a)_, including the relevant portion of all Tax
periods that begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the Closing
Date

 



81  (a " _Straddle Period_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the positions taken, and with accounting methods used, on the
Tax Returns filed by or with respect to the Transferred Companies prior to
the date on which the Closing occurs, unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law or agreed by Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser shall deliver any such Tax
Return to Seller for Sellers review at least 30 days (or, in the case of
premium tax returns, 10 days) prior to the date such Tax Return is required to
be filed for Sellers approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of real or
personal property Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days from the beginning of such Straddle Period through the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (y) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to the
amount of Tax which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. Any exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis shall be apportioned on a per diem basis.

(c) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause the Transferred
Companies to prepare and timely file, all Tax Returns required to be filed by
or with respect to the Transferred Companies for any Tax period beginning
after the Closing Date.

 

(d) Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, neither Seller
nor Purchaser shall, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without
the prior written consent of the other party, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, amend any Tax Returns of or
with respect to the Transferred Companies relating in whole or in part to a
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the other party or any of its
Affiliates.

 

Section 7.04. _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund (whether received in cash or
applied as a credit, and including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto) (a " _Tax Refund_ ") relating to the Transferred Companies for Taxes
paid for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date (other than to the extent such refund results from the carryback of a
Tax attribute of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to a Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date and other than to
the extent included as a receivable on the Final Closing Statement) shall
be the property of Seller. If received by Purchaser or the Transferred
Companies, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Transferred Companies to, pay
such Tax Refund promptly to Seller, net of any Tax cost to Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates attributable to the receipt of such refund and any reasonable
expenses with respect thereto. In the event that any such Tax Refund is
subsequently contested by any Tax Authority, such contest shall be handled in
accordance with the procedures in  _Section 10.05_. Any additional Taxes
resulting from the contest shall be indemnified in accordance with _Section
10.02_. All other Tax Refunds relating to the Transferred Companies shall be
the property of Purchaser, and if received by Seller or its Affiliates,
Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay such Tax Refund promptly
to Purchaser, net of any Tax cost to Seller or any of its Affiliates
attributable to the receipt of such refund and any reasonable expenses with
respect thereto.

 



82 Section 7.05. _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and Purchaser
shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of
them or their respective Affiliates may reasonably request of the other in
filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for Tax Refund, determining
a liability for Taxes or a right to a Tax Refund, or participating in or
conducting any contest in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax Authorities. Each party and
its Affiliates shall make its employees available on a basis mutually
convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any documents
or information provided hereunder. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall retain
all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Transferred Companies for each Tax
period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods
until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax
period to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified in writing of such extensions for
the respective Tax periods, and (ii) three years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this
_Section 7.05_ shall be kept confidential except as otherwise may be
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for Tax
Refunds or in conducting a contest or as otherwise may be required by
Applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange.

 

Section 7.06. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(a) With respect to the sale of any Transferred Company that is a domestic
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (" _Transferred U.S.
Corporations_ "), Seller and Purchaser shall, upon notice to Seller by
Purchaser prior to the Closing with respect to such Transferred U.S.
Corporation, jointly make a Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with
Applicable Law and under any comparable provision of state, local or foreign
law for which a separate election is permissible and as set forth herein.
Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate in good faith with each other in the
preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns required to be filed in
connection with the making of such an election, including the exchange of
information and the joint preparation and filing of Form 8023 and related
schedules. Purchaser and Seller agree to report the transfers under this
Agreement consistent with any such elections and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so by Applicable Law with respect to
Taxes pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

(b) Purchaser shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all
Section 338 Forms in accordance with Applicable Law with respect to Taxes and
the terms of this Agreement and shall deliver such Section 338 Forms to Seller
at least 30 days prior to the date such Section 338 Forms are required to be
filed for Sellers review and comment. Seller shall provide Purchaser with
such information as Purchaser reasonably requests in order to prepare the
Section 338 Forms by the later of 30 days after Purchasers request for such
information or 30 days prior to the date on which Purchaser is required to
deliver such forms to Seller.

the assets of such Transferred U.S. Corporations. If within ten (10) days
after the delivery of the Allocation Purchaser notifies Seller in writing that

Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute
within twenty (20) days. In the event that Purchaser and Seller are unable to
resolve such dispute within twenty (20) days, Purchaser and Seller shall
jointly retain the Independent Accountant to resolve the disputed items. Upon
resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation
shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.

payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other or the
others Affiliates or the Transferred Companies under this _Article VII_ and
under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof to the extent permissible under Applicable Law. Prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall terminate all Tax Agreements to which any
Transferred Company is a party such that no Transferred Company shall have any
obligations thereunder following the Closing. Seller shall make or cause to
be made (and shall refrain from making or causing to be made, as applicable)
Tax elections (including on a protective basis) so that no Transferred U.S.
Corporation for which no Section 338(h)(10) Election is made pursuant to
_Section 7.06(a)_ shall suffer any reduction in tax basis or other attributes

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 10.01. _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this _Article
X_ and shall terminate and expire on the date that is 18 months following the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that the Seller Specified Representations, the

87 (b) To the extent that it is to be performed after the Closing, each covenant
in this Agreement will, for purposes of this _Article X_, survive and remain
effect in accordance with its terms plus a period of six months thereafter,
after which no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may be brought
hereunder. All covenants in this Agreement that by their terms are required
to be fully performed at or prior to the Closing shall survive until the date
that is eighteen months following the Closing Date.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for indemnification in respect of
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement for which
indemnification may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at
which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this _Section 10.01_ if such claim for indemnification is
asserted by written notice (which includes a reasonable description of the
claim based on facts known at the time and a good faith estimate of the
Indemnifiable Loss) given as required herein prior to the expiration of
the applicable period of survival. Any claim for indemnification in respect
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is not asserted by
notice given as required herein prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period specified in the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
_Section 10.01_ shall not be valid and any right to indemnification for such
claim shall be deemed to have been irrevocably waived after the expiration of
such period of survival.

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any
and all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against, imposed upon or incurred or
suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified Person resulting from or arising
out of:



     | (i) | any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and
all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against, imposed upon or incurred
or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Person resulting from or arising out
of:



     | (i) | any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of Purchaser made in this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any breach or non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant

     | (iv) | the operation of the Business after the Closing Date
(except to the extent such Indemnifiable Loss is subject to indemnification by
Seller of any Purchaser Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_
or is a Liability otherwise expressly assumed or retained by Seller or its
Affiliates pursuant to any of the Transaction Agreements); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | any ACA Fees incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including the Ceding Companies) with respect to premiums written in
connection with the Business from and after the Effective Time (for the
avoidance of doubt, any ACA Fees incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates
with respect to premiums written in connection with the Business prior to the

---|---|--- 
 

(c) For purposes of determining whether any representation and warranty has
been breached and the amount of any Indemnifiable Losses under this _Article
X_, each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement (other than
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.19_ or _Section
3.20(b)_ or clauses (vii), (viii), (ix) or (x) of _Section 3.06(a)_) shall
be read without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifier
contained therein.

 

Section 10.03. _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) No party shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless its respective
Indemnitees under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ (in the case of Seller, and other
than with respect to an inaccuracy in or breach of any Seller Specified
Representation) or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ (in the case of Purchaser, and other
than with respect to an inaccuracy in or breach of any Purchaser Specified
Representation) (i) with respect to any claim or series of claims arising out
of substantially similar facts and circumstances, unless such claim or series
of claims involves Indemnifiable Losses in excess of $50,000 (the "
_Threshold Amount_ ") (nor shall any claim that does not exceed the Threshold
Amount be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnitor is responsible under
clause (ii) below) and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitees under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ or such
_Section 10.02(b)(i)_, as the case may be, exceeds $9,400,000 for
all Indemnifiable Losses (the " _Deductible_ "), at which point such
Indemnitor shall be liable to its respective Indemnitees for the value of the
Indemnitees claims under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to
a breach of any Seller Specified Representation) or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_
(other than with respect to a breach of any Purchaser Specified
Representation), as the case may be, that is in excess of the Deductible,
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_. The maximum
aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other
hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all Indemnifiable Losses
under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ , in the case of Seller (other than with respect
to a breach of any Seller Specified Representation), or _Section
10.02(b)(i)_, in the case of Purchaser (other than with respect to a breach of
any Purchaser Specified Representation), shall be $141,000,000; _provided_ ,
that the maximum aggregate liability of Seller to all Purchaser Indemnified
Persons for any or all Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement shall not
exceed the Purchase Price. The limitations in this  _Section 10.03(a)_ shall
not apply to claims made under _Section 10.02(a)(iii)_, _Section
10.02(b)(iii)_ or _Section 10.02(b)(iv)_.

 



89 (b) If any Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) actually recognizes a Tax benefit or
Tax cost in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in
the definition of "Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 10.04(iv)_
subsequent to an Indemnity Payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee with
respect to such Indemnifiable Loss on or prior to the date that falls two
years from the end of the taxable year in which such Indemnifiable Loss was
incurred, then such Indemnitee or Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the
Indemnitor the amount of such Tax benefit or Tax cost, as applicable,
recognized by such Indemnitee (or its Affiliates), in the case of a Tax
benefit, up to the amount of such Indemnity Payment received by the
Indemnitee, net of any expenses incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Person
in pursuing such Tax benefit, within 15 days after the Indemnitee (or such
Affiliate) recognizes such Tax benefit in the form of cash actually received
or reduction in cash Taxes actually paid. If any Tax benefit (or portion
thereof) in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in
the definition of "Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 10.04(iv)_,
that either (i) reduces the Indemnity Payments made by an Indemnitor prior to
the time such payment is made or (ii) obligates an Indemnitee to make
payments to the Indemnitor under the immediately preceding sentence of this
_Section 10.03(b)_, is disallowed as a result of an audit or otherwise, the
applicable Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the applicable Indemnitee the
amount of such disallowed Tax benefit within 30 days after the Indemnitee
notifies the Indemnitor that the adjustment with respect to such disallowance
has been paid or otherwise taken into account.

(c) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder to the
extent such mitigation is required by Applicable Law; _provided_ that the
costs and expenses of such mitigation shall constitute Indemnifiable Losses
hereunder.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that a
Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled to seek indemnification from Seller
under _Section 10.02(a)(iii)_ in respect of any Indemnifiable Loss resulting
from or arising out of any Excluded Liability (other than any Excluded
Liability that comprises Covered Taxes, Excluded Benefits Liabilities,
Excluded Escheatment Matters or Indebtedness, or to the extent related to the
businesses of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies)
other than the Business) and the matter giving rise to such Indemnifiable Loss
also constitutes an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
of Seller made in this Agreement, such Purchaser Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to seek indemnification from Seller only under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_
and no claim with respect thereto may be brought under _Section
10.02(a)(iii)_.

_provided,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary

for lost profits (including diminution in value used by a trier of fact in
determining lost profits) if and only if (1) such damages for lost profits are
recoverable under the laws of the State of New York; (2) the Indemnitee

Section 10.05. _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than 30 days after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim)
thereof and such notice shall include a reasonable description of the claim
based on facts known at the time and any documents relating to the claim and
an estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss and shall reference the specific
sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such claim to the extent
reasonably ascertainable; _provided_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced by such delay (except that the Indemnitor shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five Business Days after the Indemnitees receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not as long as it
conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof subsequent to the
Indemnitor notifying the Indemnitee in writing of its election to assume such
defense. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnitee (A) for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed
the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee
shall have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above)
or (B) if the Third Party Claim involves conflicts of interest for the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor (in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnitee) that would make representation by the same counsel inappropriate,
in which event the Indemnitor shall be responsible for only one counsel for
the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the
other party hereto shall cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision
to the Indemnitor of records and information that are relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; _provided_ , in each case, that such other party shall not be
obligated to provide such records, information or access to

 



92  Indemnitor if doing so would violate Applicable Law or jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege. Whether or not the Indemnitor
shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall
not admit any liability with respect to, or pay, settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party
Claim with the Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the
Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (i) includes
a release of the Indemnitee from all Liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy, (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee and (iv) does
not impose any financial cost on the Indemnitee (other than by application of
the limitations set forth _Section 10.03(a))_. If the Indemnitor submits to
the Indemnitee a bona fide settlement offer with respect to a Third Party
Claim that has been accepted by all Persons bringing such Third Party Claim
and otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth in the proviso of the
immediately preceding sentence and the Indemnitee refuses to consent to such
settlement, then thereafter the Indemnitors liability to the Indemnitee with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitors portion of
the settlement amount included in such settlement offer.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
have the sole right to represent the interests of the Transferred Companies
and settle all issues in its sole discretion, and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense, in any audit or other examination or administrative or
court proceeding relating to Taxes (" _Tax Proceedings_ ") for all taxable
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_
that Seller shall not pay, discharge, settle, compromise, litigate or
otherwise dispose of any item subject to such Tax Proceedings in a manner that
could adversely affect Purchaser or any of its Affiliates without obtaining
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in the conduct of
any Tax audit and any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to any
such Tax audit that may adversely affect Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.
All other Tax Proceedings with respect to the Transferred Companies shall be
controlled by Purchaser.

Section 10.06. _Direct Claims_. The Indemnitor will have a period of 30 days
within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account of
an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor will
be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be
entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee.

 

Section 10.07. _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except (a) as set forth in  _Section 11.14_, (b) as expressly contemplated
by _Section 2.06_, (c) for any remedy expressly contemplated by any other
Transaction Agreement with respect to a claim made under such Transaction
Agreement and (d) under the circumstances described in _Section 9.03(y)_, if

in this _Article X_.

 



93 Section 10.08. _Certain Other Matters_.

 

(a) Upon making any Indemnity Payment, Indemnitor will, to the extent of such
Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to all rights of Indemnitee against any
third Person (other than any Tax Authority) in respect of the Indemnifiable
Loss to which the Indemnity Payment related. Without limiting the generality
or effect of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor
will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation rights.

(b) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach. The
representations, warranties and covenants of Seller, and the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of (and the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth herein notwithstanding) (i) any investigation
made by or on behalf of any of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons (including by
any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons or any of such Representatives knew or should
have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be
inaccurate, regardless of whether such investigation was made or such
knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or (ii) Purchasers waiver of any condition set forth in _Article
VIII_. The representations, warranties and covenants of Purchaser, and the
Seller Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification with respect thereto,
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of (and the Seller
Indemnified Persons shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations
and warranties of Purchaser set forth herein notwithstanding) (i) any
investigation made by or on behalf of any of the Seller Indemnified Persons
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any of
the Seller Indemnified Persons or any of such Representatives knew or should
have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be
inaccurate, regardless of whether such investigation was made or such
knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or (ii) Sellers waiver of any condition set forth in _Article
VIII_.

Any party may, by notice given in accordance with this _Section 11.03_ to the
other parties, designate another address or person for receipt of notices
hereunder, _provided_ that notice of such a change shall be effective upon
receipt.

 

Section 11.04. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction
Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not
in conflict with this Agreement, between or on behalf of Seller and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the other
hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

 

Section 11.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any
Applicable Law or as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be so broad as to be unenforceable, that provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 11.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of each of the parties hereto;

 



96   _provided_ , that Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights and
obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_
, that (a) no such assignment will relieve Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder and (b) no such assignment shall have the effect of changing the
identity of any Purchaser Affiliate that is contemplated to be a party to any
of the Coinsurance Agreements, the Trust Agreements, the Administrative
Services Agreements, the Business Transition Agreements, the Transition
Services Agreement, the HIPAA BAAs or the Assumed Reinsurance Novation
Agreements. Any attempted assignment in violation of this  _Section 11.06_
shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 11.07. _Waivers and Amendments_. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by
each of the parties hereto. No provision of this Agreement may be waived
except by a written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.08.  _Disclosure Schedules_. Matters reflected in any section or
subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so
reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No reference
to or disclosure of any item or other matter in any section or subsection of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is
material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or
disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any contract, Applicable Law
or Governmental Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

Section 11.09. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_. 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO SUCH STATES PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICT OF LAW THAT COULD COMPEL THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION.

(b) Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court located in New York County in the
State of New York, over any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if said court determines that it does not have
subject matter jurisdiction, then said action, suit or proceeding may be
brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York County.
Each party hereto agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party at the respective
addresses set forth in _Section 11.03_ (or at such other address for a party
as such party

 



97  may have designated in accordance with _Section 11.03_) shall be effective
service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against such
party in any such court. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such action, suit
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each party hereto agrees that any final, nonappealable judgment in any
such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive
and binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts to
whose jurisdiction such party may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
11.09_.

98 Section 11.11. _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the other
Transaction Agreements, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any of
the Schedules or Exhibits hereto or thereto, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the AEB
Companies), nor any Representative of any of them, makes or has made, and
Purchaser has not relied on, any inducement or promise to Purchaser except as
specifically made in this Agreement or any representation or warranty to
Purchaser, oral or written, express or implied, other than as expressly set
forth in _Article III_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
other than as expressly set forth in _Article III_, no Person has made any
representation or warranty to Purchaser with respect to the Business, the AEB
Companies, the Transferred Securities, the Assigned Contracts, the Assumed
Liabilities or any other matter, including with respect to (i)
merchantability, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, (ii) the
operation of the Business or the AEB Companies by Purchaser after
the Closing, (iii) the probable success or profitability of the Business or
the AEB Companies after the Closing or (iv) any information, documents or
material made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in any "data rooms," information memoranda, management
presentations, functional "break-out" discussions or in any other form or
forum in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any estimation, valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast with
respect to the Business or the AEB Companies. With respect to any such
estimation, valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast (including the
confidential information memoranda prepared by or on behalf of Seller in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Actuarial Report), Purchaser acknowledges that: (i) there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimations, valuations,
appraisals, projections and forecasts; (ii) it is familiar with such
uncertainties; (iii) it is not acting and has not acted in reliance on any
such estimation valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast delivered by or
on behalf of Seller to Purchaser (other than as expressly set forth in
_Article III_ ); (iv) such estimations, valuations, appraisals, projections
and forecasts are not and shall not be deemed to be representations or
warranties of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than as expressly set
forth in _Article III_ ) and (v) it shall have no claim against any Person
with respect to any such valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast (other
than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement).

 

(b) Seller makes no express or implied representation or warranty hereby or
otherwise under this Agreement as to the future experience, success or
profitability of the Business, whether or not conducted in a manner similar to
the manner in which the Business was conducted prior to the Closing, that the
reserves held by or on behalf of the AEB Companies or the assets supporting
such reserves have been or will be adequate or sufficient for the purposes
for which they were established, or that the reinsurance recoverables taken
into account in determining the amount of such reserves will be collectible.

 

(c) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has made its own
inquiry and investigation into and, based thereon, has formed an independent
judgment concerning the

 



99  Business, the AEB Companies, the Transferred Securities, the Assigned
Contracts and the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) has been provided adequate access
to such information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to form such
independent judgment, (iii) has had such time as it deems necessary and
appropriate fully and completely to review and analyze such information,
documents and other materials and (iv) has been provided an opportunity to
ask questions of Seller with respect to such information, documents and other
materials and has received answers to such questions that it considers
satisfactory. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates has made any representations or warranties, express
or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of, and that Purchaser and its
Affiliates have made their investment decision with respect to the acquisition
of the Transferred Securities without reliance upon such information,
documents and other materials other than the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements.

 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Independent Producers who
marketed, sold or placed AEB Policies in connection with the Business may
have certain rights with respect to such AEB Policies and related records;
(ii) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has the power to transfer,
assign or sell such rights or records, including any such rights comprising
or purporting to be the right to renew any such AEB Policy upon its
expiration or termination; and (iii) any representations or warranties
contained in the Transaction Agreements with respect to such rights and
records are made subject to the acknowledgements set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) above.

Section 11.12. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than the rights granted
to the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons under
_Article X_, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to
give any Person (including, but not limited to, the employees of Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller), other than the parties hereto, their successors and
permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

 

Section 11.13. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by
the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together
constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to any Transaction Agreement by means of
electronic transmission utilizing readable image scan technology shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of any such
Agreement.

 

Section 11.14. _Equitable Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without the necessity of posting bond
or other undertaking, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Agreement, this being in addition (subject to the terms of this
Agreement) to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. In the event that any Action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and each party
hereto hereby waives any defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate
remedy at law. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party

 



100  hereto brings any Action in accordance with this _Section 11.14_ to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by the other
party, the Outside Date shall be automatically extended (i) for the period
during which such action is pending, plus 10 Business Days or (ii) by such
other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the
case may be.

 

 _(The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank)_

 



101 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first above written.

assigns, transfers and delivers to the Reinsurer as premium hereunder all of
its rights, title and interest in one hundred percent (100%) of all of the
following amounts actually received or receivable at or after the Effective

---|---|--- 
 

(b) The Ceding Company agrees to execute and record all additional documents
and take all other steps reasonably requested by the Reinsurer to effectuate
such transfer to the Reinsurer. Direct receipt by the Reinsurer, including in
its role as Administrator under the Administrative Services Agreement, or any
of its Affiliates of any Recoveries shall satisfy the Ceding
Companys obligations to transfer any such amount to the Reinsurer hereunder.

(c) Pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, the Reinsurer shall
have the right in accordance with the terms thereof to collect all Recoveries.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Reinsurer shall be responsible for
and has hereby assumed the financial risk of any uncollected or

(d) The Parties intend the Ceding Companys assignment pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)_ to be a present assignment of all of the Ceding Companys rights,
title and interest in the Recoveries and not an assignment as collateral. To
the extent that the Ceding Company receives or recovers any Recoveries or
other amounts from any third party attributable to the Reinsured Contracts,
the Ceding Company shall hold such amounts in trust for the benefit of the
Reinsurer and shall immediately transfer and deliver such amounts to the
Reinsurer, together with any endorsements required to effect the transfer
and any pertinent information that the Ceding Company may have relating
thereto. The Reinsurer is hereby authorized to endorse for payment to the
Reinsurer any checks, drafts, money orders and other instruments pertaining to
the Recoveries and other amounts that are payable to, or to the order of, the
Ceding Company and received by the Reinsurer under this Agreement, whether
they are delivered to the Bank Accounts or otherwise transferred and delivered
by the Ceding Company to the Reinsurer. 

(e) Upon any recapture of the reinsurance ceded under this Agreement, (i) the
Recoveries shall be automatically re-assigned to the Ceding Company, without
the need for any action on the part of the Parties and (ii) the Ceding Company
shall have the right to direct the Specified Trustees to distribute future
ModCo Distribution Amounts to the Ceding Company.

the Specified Trust Agreements directly on behalf of the Ceding Company, in
each instance in accordance with the terms of the Administrative Services
Agreement.

 



\- 12 - Section 3.4. _Defenses_. The Reinsurer accepts, reinsures and assumes
the Reinsured Risks subject to any and all defenses, set-offs and
counterclaims to which the Ceding Company would be entitled with respect to
the Reinsured Risks, it being expressly understood and agreed to by the
Parties hereto that no such defenses, set-offs, or counterclaims are or shall
be waived by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and that the Reinsurer is and shall be
fully subrogated in and to all such defenses, set-offs and counterclaims.

Section 3.5. _Guaranty Association Assessments, ACA Fees and Premium Taxes_.
The Ceding Company and the Reinsurer shall settle amounts due with regard to
guaranty association assessments, ACA Fees, premium taxes and premium tax
credits included in the Reinsured Liabilities in accordance with the terms of
the Administrative Services Agreement.

Section 3.6. _Offset_. Except as otherwise provided under Applicable Law, any
undisputed debits or credits incurred in favor of or against either the
Ceding Company or the Reinsurer under or with respect to this Agreement are
deemed mutual debits or credits and may be set off, and only the net balance
shall be allowed or paid, regardless of any insolvency, rehabilitation,
conservatorship or comparable proceeding by or against the Ceding Company or
the Reinsurer. Such right shall apply to the full extent permitted under the
laws of the state of domicile of the insolvent party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party acknowledges and agrees
that it shall have no right hereunder or pursuant to Applicable Law to offset
any amounts due or owing (or to become due or owing) to the other Party under
this Agreement against any amounts due or owing by such other Party or any of
its Affiliates under the other Transaction Documents or any other agreement,
contract or understanding.

 

Section 3.7. _Certain Reports from the Reinsurer_.

 

(a) The Reinsurer shall provide to the Ceding Company periodic accounting and
other reports with respect to the Reinsured Contracts as specified in the
Administrative Services Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth herein or in
the Administrative Services Agreement, settlement with respect to amounts owed
hereunder by the Reinsurer to the Ceding Company and by the Ceding Company to
the Reinsurer shall be performed through the direct payment by the Reinsurer
of Reinsured Risks and direct receipt by the Reinsurer of Recoveries on an
ongoing basis in its capacity as Administrator under the Administrative
Services Agreement. 

(b) Each calendar quarter, the Reinsurer shall provide to the Ceding Company,
by the relevant Capital Reporting Deadline, a calculation of the RBC Ratio of
the Reinsurer and the MCCSR Ratio of SLA, as of the last day of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter, (x) with respect to quarters other
than the last quarter of a calendar year, based on the Reinsurers or SLAs
(as applicable) good faith estimate using, to the extent any factors are not
reasonably available, amounts based on reasonable estimation and annualization
or (y) with respect to the last quarter of a calendar year, as calculated
by the Reinsurer or SLA (as applicable). In addition, if the RBC Ratio of the
Reinsurer as of any quarter-end is below the amount described

 



\- 13 -  in clause (a) of the definition of "Triggering Event" herein, or if the
MCCSR Ratio of SLA as of any quarter-end is below the amount described in
clause (b) of the definition of "Triggering Event" herein, the Reinsurer
shall provide to the Ceding Company evidence that such shortfall has been
cured by the tenth (10th) Business Day following the applicable Capital
Reporting Deadline, if applicable. Each such calculation shall include
reasonable supporting detail with respect to such calculation.

 

(c) The Reinsurer shall provide written notice to the Ceding Company of the
occurrence of any Triggering Event within five (5) Business Days after it
becomes aware of occurrence. In addition, the Reinsurer shall cooperate fully
with the Ceding Company and promptly respond to the Ceding Companys

a Triggering Event has occurred and is continuing.

(d) At the Ceding Companys request, the Reinsurer shall provide the Ceding
Company with (i) copies of its most recent annual and quarterly NAIC
statutory financial statements and (ii) a copy of the most recent annual
audited financial statements of SLA, along with the audit report thereon. The
Ceding Company shall maintain the confidentiality of each such statutory
financial statements and reports for a period of five (5) years after receipt
thereof, in each case to the extent that such statements and reports are not
publicly available.

 

Section 3.8. _Ceded Reinsurance Contracts_.

 

(a) The Ceding Company agrees that it shall not modify, amend, renew,
recapture or terminate any Ceded Reinsurance Contract, or any trust or other
agreement or instrument providing security for the Ceding Company with respect
to any Ceded Reinsurance Contract, or waive any of its rights under any such
agreement except with the Reinsurers prior written consent or at
the Reinsurers instruction. The Ceding Company shall not enter into any new
ceded reinsurance agreement with respect to any of the Reinsured Contracts.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, upon the Reinsurers reasonable
request, the Ceding Company shall reasonably cooperate with the Reinsurer and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to terminate or cause the recapture of
any Ceded Reinsurance Contract or to novate any Ceded Reinsurance Contract
(and any trust or other agreement or instrument providing security for the
Ceding Company with respect to such Ceded Reinsurance Contract) from the
Ceding Company to the Reinsurer on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable
to the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer. The Ceding Company shall promptly
advise the Reinsurer of any communications with respect to any such proposed
termination, recapture or novation. All correspondence from either the Ceding
Company or the Reinsurer to any reinsurer under any Ceded Reinsurance Contract
in connection with any such proposed termination, recapture or novation shall
be in a form approved by the other Party; _provided_ that any such approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event any
amount is paid by any reinsurer to the Ceding Company or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the recapture of risks under any Ceded
Reinsurance Contract, the Ceding Company shall or shall cause its applicable
Affiliate to pay such amount to the Reinsurer promptly upon receipt thereof.

 

Section 3.9. _Producers_. As regards the Reinsured Contracts, the Ceding
Company shall not modify or amend, or waive any of its rights under, any
agreement between it or any of

 



\- 14 -  its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Independent Producer, on the other
hand, who has solicited, marketed or sold any of the Reinsured Contracts,
except with the Reinsurers prior written consent or at the Reinsurers
instruction.

Section 3.10. _Novation_. Following the Effective Time, if requested by the
Reinsurer and subject to obtaining all applicable approvals from any Person,
the Ceding Company shall reasonably cooperate with the Reinsurer and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to novate any Underlying
Reinsurance Agreements (and any rights in any trust or other agreement or
instrument providing security with respect to any such Underlying Reinsurance
Agreement) from the Ceding Company to the Reinsurer or a designated Affiliate
of the Reinsurer;  _provided_ that each of the Ceding Company and the
Reinsurer shall, to the extent practicable, cooperate, work together in good
faith and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of the cedent under any Underlying Reinsurance Agreement that is a
Specified Reinsured Contract to the novation of such Specified Reinsured
Contract and the corresponding Specified Trust Account on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer, and upon
receipt of such consent the Parties shall cause such Specified Reinsured
Contract and Specified Trust Account to be novated to the Reinsurer;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties shall have no obligation to make
any payment to such cedent or any other Person in connection with obtaining
any such consent. The Ceding Company shall promptly advise the Reinsurer of
any communications with respect to any such proposed novation. All
correspondence from either the Ceding Company or the Reinsurer to any
Underlying Company under any Underlying Reinsurance Agreement as applicable,
in connection with any such proposed novation shall be in a form approved by
the other Party; _provided_ that any such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Reinsurer shall be responsible for the
cost of obtaining any consents for the novations contemplated by this Section
3.11, except that each of the Parties shall bear its own costs in connection
with obtaining the consent of the applicable cedent to the novation of any
Specified Reinsurance Contract. Any Underlying Reinsurance Agreement that is
novated to the Reinsurer pursuant to this Section shall cease to be an
Underlying Reinsurance Agreement upon the effectiveness of such novation.

Section 3.11. _Security Interest_.

 

(a) The Parties intend the Ceding Companys assignment pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)_ to be a present assignment of all of the Ceding Companys rights,
title and interest in the Recoveries and not an assignment as collateral.
However, to the extent that such assignment is not recognized as a present
assignment, is not valid or is recharacterized as a pledge rather than a
lawful conveyance to the Reinsurer, the Ceding Company does hereby grant,
bargain, sell, convey, assign and otherwise pledge to the Reinsurer, all of
the Ceding Companys right, title and interest, if any (legal, equitable or
otherwise) to all Recoveries (and any Bank Account, lockbox or other account
set up for the receipt of the Recoveries after the Effective Time) (the "
_Collateral_ ") to secure all of the Ceding Companys obligations under this
Agreement.

 

(b) This _Section 3.11_ is being included in this Agreement to ensure that,
if an insolvency or other court determines that, notwithstanding the
provisions of this Agreement, including _Section 3.2(a)_, and the express
intent of the Parties in entering into this Agreement, the Ceding Company
retained ownership of or any rights in the Collateral, the Reinsurers rights
to the Collateral are protected with a first priority, perfected security
interest, and it is the intent of the Parties that this _Section 3.11_ be
interpreted as such.

 



\- 15 - (c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to support the conclusion that
the Ceding Company will retain any ownership of or any rights in the
Collateral after the Effective Time or to support the conclusion that the
Reinsurer does not acquire full ownership thereof as of the Effective Time.

 

(d) The Ceding Company shall execute and deliver and the Reinsurer is
authorized to execute and deliver any and all financing statements reasonably
requested by the Reinsurer to the extent that it may appear appropriate to the
Reinsurer to file such financing statements in order to perfect the
Reinsurers title under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as said code
has been enacted in the State of Kansas, the State of Michigan, or any other
applicable jurisdiction to any and all Collateral and the Ceding Company shall
do such further acts and things as the Reinsurer may request in order that the
security interest granted hereunder may be maintained as a first perfected
security interest.

ARTICLE IV.

 

LICENSES; RESERVE CREDIT; SECURITY

 

Section 4.1. _Licenses; Reserve Credit_. At all times during the term of this
Agreement, the Reinsurer shall (a) use its reasonable best efforts to hold
and maintain its license or accreditation in the Ceding Company Domiciliary
State, and (b) take all other actions so that the Ceding Company may receive
Reserve Credit. The Reinsurer shall promptly notify the Ceding Company of any
event or change in its licensing or accreditation in the Ceding Company
Domiciliary State or other condition that would be reasonably likely to result
or has resulted in any loss of, or impairment to, Reserve
Credit. Furthermore, upon any loss of Reserve Credit, the Ceding Company and
the Reinsurer agree to amend this Agreement or the Trust Agreement, enter into
other agreements or execute additional documents, or provide alternative forms
of security as reasonably needed to comply with the credit for reinsurance
laws and regulations and/or the requirements of the applicable Governmental
Authority of the Ceding Company Domiciliary State to ensure the Ceding Company
obtains Reserve Credit. 

Section 4.2. _Security_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Reinsurer, as grantor, shall
establish and thereafter shall maintain, at its sole cost and expense, the
Trust Account with the Trustee, naming the Ceding Company as sole beneficiary
thereof to secure the Reinsurers obligations hereunder. The Reinsurer shall
maintain the Trust Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Trust Agreement until such time as a Trust Account is no longer required
pursuant to _Section 4.9_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Trust Account is being funded with Eligible Assets in accordance with 
_Section 2.04(c)(i)_ of the Master Transaction Agreement and Section 3.1.

(b) In accordance with the terms set forth herein and in the Trust Agreement,
and subject to the provisions of _Section 4.6_ and _Section 4.7_ hereof, the
Reinsurer shall ensure that the

 



\- 16 -  Trust Account holds Eligible Assets in accordance with the terms hereof with
a Statutory Book Value equal to the Required Balance. All transfers to and
withdrawals from the Trust Account shall be in accordance with and subject to
the requirements set forth herein and in the Trust Agreement.

(c) During the term of the Trust Agreement, the Reinsurer shall not, and
shall direct that the Trustee shall not, grant or cause or permit to be
created or granted in favor of any third person any security interest
whatsoever in any of the assets in the Trust Account.

 

Section 4.3. _Trust Account and Settlements_. The Trustee shall hold assets in
the Trust Account pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. All
settlements of account under this Agreement between the Ceding Company and the
Reinsurer shall be made in United States dollars in cash or its equivalent.

 

Section 4.4. _Eligible Assets_. The assets that may be held in the Trust
Account shall consist of cash or investments of the type consistent with the
requirements for authorized investments and admitted assets under the
insurance laws of the Reinsurer Domiciliary State; _provided_ , that (i) each
such investment that is a security is issued by an institution that is not
the Reinsurer, Ceding Company or an Affiliate of either Party and (ii) such
investments comply with the Investment Guidelines; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that during the continuance of a Triggering Event, such assets shall
also meet all requirements under the insurance laws of the Ceding Company
Domiciliary State with respect to providing Reserve Credit to the Ceding
Company and must consist of securities that have been designated as Class One
or Class Two by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners, (the assets meeting the requirements of this
sentence being the " _Eligible Assets_ "). Following the Closing Date, the
Reinsurer shall, in accordance with _Section 4.8(b)_, provide to Ceding
Company a quarterly report listing each asset in the Trust Account and the
Statutory Book Value of each such asset as of the end of the relevant calendar
quarter and certify that each such asset is an Eligible Asset. The Parties
agree to make such changes to the Investment Guidelines as the State of
Michigan Insurance Department may request so long as the effect of such
changes does not materially adversely affect the liquidity and
overall quality of the trust assets.

Section 4.5. _Deposit of Assets_. Prior to depositing assets in the Trust
Account, the Reinsurer will execute assignments or endorsements in blank, or
transfer legal title to the Trustee of all shares, obligations or any other
assets requiring assignments, in order that the Ceding Company, or the Trustee
upon the direction of the Ceding Company, may whenever necessary negotiate
these assets without the consent or signature from the Reinsurer or any other
entity.

 

Section 4.6. _Modification During a Triggering Event_. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that, upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, certain provisions
of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement shall cease to be effective, and
other provisions shall automatically be effective, so long as such Triggering
Event continues, as described herein and in the Trust Agreement. Provisions
that will automatically become modified upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of a Triggering Event are as follows: (a) the assets constituting
Eligible Assets shall be modified as set forth in  _Section 4.4_; (b) the
valuation of Eligible Assets in the Trust Account under _Section 4.2(b)_
hereof and all other applicable sections of this Agreement shall be modified
from Statutory Book Value to Fair Market Value; (c) _Section 4.7(a)_
governing the use and application of assets in the Trust Account by the Ceding
Company prior to a Triggering Event shall not apply, (d) _Section 4.7(b)_

Trust Account prior to a Triggering Event shall not apply, and (f) _Section
4.8(a)(ii)_ governing the adjustment of the security held in the Trust
Account during a Triggering Event shall apply. In addition, as soon as is
practicable, but not more than ten (10) Business Days following the date on
which the Reinsurer becomes aware of the occurrence of a Triggering Event
(unless the Ceding Company shall agree to a longer period, then by the end of
such longer period), the Reinsurer shall (i) substitute any assets in the
Trust Account that are not Eligible Assets for assets which are Eligible
Assets, and (ii) deposit additional assets consisting of Eligible Assets in
the Trust Account sufficient to ensure that the aggregate Fair Market Value of
the Eligible Assets in the Trust Account is not less than the
Required Balance as of the last day of the immediately prior calendar quarter
end, computed taking into account the occurrence of a Triggering Event. Upon
the termination of any Triggering Event, the above-described modifications to
the provisions hereof shall cease to apply, and this Agreement shall be
interpreted and applied as though no Triggering Event had occurred.

 

Section 4.7. _Withdrawal of Assets from the Trust Account_.

 

(a) _Outside a Triggering Event_. So long as no Triggering Event has occurred
and is continuing, the Ceding Company and Reinsurer agree that the assets
maintained in the Trust Account may be withdrawn by the Ceding Company (or any
successor by operation of law of the Ceding Company, including, without
limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the
Ceding Company) without diminution because of any insolvency, rehabilitation,
conservatorship or comparable proceeding (an " _Insolvency_ ") on the part of
the Ceding Company or Reinsurer, in accordance with the terms of the Trust
Agreement, in order to pay or reimburse the Ceding Company for any undisputed
amounts due from the Reinsurer under this Agreement and not yet recovered from
the Reinsurer, including any Reinsured Risks, Terminal Settlement, or other
amounts due under this Agreement, which amounts have not been paid by the
Reinsurer within ten (10) days following its receipt of a specific written
notice thereof. The amount of any such withdrawal in excess of amounts then
due to the Ceding Company hereunder shall be deemed maintained in trust for
the benefit of Reinsurer and promptly returned to the Trust Account, along
with interest on such amounts at the Interest Rate for the period that such
amounts are held by the Ceding Company. 

(b) _During a Triggering Event_. During the continuation of a Triggering
Event, the Ceding Company and Reinsurer agree that the assets maintained in
the Trust Account may be withdrawn by the Ceding Company, or any successor by
operation of law of the Ceding Company including, without limitation, any
liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the Ceding Company,
without diminution because of insolvency on the part of the Ceding Company or
Reinsurer, at any time without notice or consent from the Reinsurer but only
for one or more of the following purposes:

 



     | (i) | to reimburse the Ceding Company for the Reinsurers share of
premiums returned to the owners of the Reinsured Contracts reinsured hereunder
because of cancellations of the Reinsured Contracts; 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 18 - share of benefits or losses payable by the Ceding Company pursuant to the
provisions of the Reinsured Contracts reinsured hereunder; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | to fund an account with the Ceding Company in an amount at
least equal to the deduction, for reinsurance ceded, from the Ceding Company
liabilities for Reinsured Contracts ceded hereunder. The account must include,
but not be limited to, amounts for policy reserves, claims and losses
incurred, including losses incurred but not reported, loss adjustment
expenses, and unearned premium reserves; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | to pay any other amounts the Ceding Company claims are due
hereunder. 
---|---|--- 

The Ceding Company shall return to the Trust Account (x) within five (5)
Business Days of withdrawal, assets withdrawn in excess of all amounts due
under _Sections 4.7(b)(i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iv)_ , or (y), in the case of
_Section 4.7(b)(iii)_, assets that are subsequently determined not to be
due, within five (5) Business Days of such determination. The Ceding Company
shall pay to the Reinsurer interest on such excess withdrawn amounts under
_Sections 4.7(b)(i)_ , _(ii)_ or  _(iv)_ at the Interest Rate for the
period that such assets are held by the Ceding Company. Any such excess amount
shall at all times be held by the Ceding Company (or any successor by
operation of law of the Ceding Company, including any liquidator,
rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the Ceding Company) in trust for the
benefit of the Reinsurer and be maintained in a segregated account, separate
and apart from any assets of the Ceding Company for the sole purpose of
funding the payments and reimbursements described in paragraphs _(i)_ ,
_(ii)_ and _(iv)_ of _Section 4.7(b)_. The Ceding Company shall pay
interest in cash to the Reinsurer on the amount withdrawn or drawn upon
under  _Section 4.7(b)(iii)_, equal to the actual amount of interest,
dividends, and other income earned on the assets in such segregated account so
long as the Fair Market Value of the assets in such segregated account and the
Fair Market Value of any remaining assets in the Trust Account after payment
of such interest equals at least, in the aggregate, the Required Balance, and
shall otherwise credit to such segregated account all such income earned on
the assets in such segregated account. The Ceding Company may at any time
substitute or exchange any assets held in such account and invest or reinvest
such assets, _provided_ that the assets so substituted or exchanged and all
reinvestment assets are Eligible Assets.

 

Section 4.8. _Adjustment of Security and Withdrawals_.

 

(a) The amount of security required to be provided by Reinsurer hereunder
shall be adjusted following the end of each calendar quarter based on (1) the
Required Balance as of the end of such calendar quarter calculated by the
Reinsurer as Administrator and furnished to the Ceding Company in a report no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the end of such calendar
quarter (the " _Security Funding Reporting Date_ ") and (2) (A) the Statutory
Book Value or, during the continuation of a Triggering Event, the Fair Market
Value, of Eligible Assets as of the end of such calendar quarter as
furnished by the Reinsurer to the Ceding Company in a report no later than
the Security Funding Reporting Date. The amount of security held in the Trust
Account shall be adjusted as follows:

 



     | (i) | So long as no Triggering Event has occurred and is
continuing: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | If the aggregate Statutory Book Value of the Eligible Assets
held in the Trust Account as of the end of such calendar quarter is less than
the Required Balance, calculated based on the most recent report delivered
by the Reinsurer under this _Section 4.8_, then Reinsurer shall, no later
than ten (10) Business Days following the Security Funding Reporting Date,
transfer additional Eligible Assets to the Trust Account so that the aggregate
Statutory Book Value of the Eligible Assets held in the Trust Account is not
less than the Required Balance. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | If the aggregate Statutory Book Value of the Eligible Assets
in the Trust Account as of the end of such calendar quarter exceeds the
Required Balance, then Reinsurer shall have the right to withdraw such excess
amount in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 19 - ---|---|--- 



     | (1) | If the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Eligible Assets
held in the Trust Account as of the end of such calendar quarter is less than
the Required Balance, calculated based on the most recent report delivered by
the Reinsurer under this _Section 4.8_, then Reinsurer shall, no later than
ten (10) Business Days following the Security Funding Reporting Date, transfer
additional Eligible Assets to the Trust Account so that the aggregate Fair
Market Value of the Eligible Assets held in the Trust Account is not less
than the Required Balance. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | If the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Eligible Assets
held in the Trust Account as of the end of such calendar quarter exceeds the
Required Balance, then the Reinsurer shall have the right to withdraw such
excess upon the prior written consent of the Ceding Company which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
---|---|--- 

(b) The report required to be delivered by the Reinsurer as described in
_Section 4.8(a)_ shall include a listing of each asset in the Trust Account
and the Statutory Book Value and Fair Market Value of each such asset as of
the end of the relevant Accounting Period and indicate if any such asset is
not an Eligible Asset. In the event that the Ceding Company disagrees with the
calculation of the Statutory Book Value of any Eligible Asset or whether any
asset is an Eligible Asset as set forth in such report, the Ceding Company
may deliver written notice to the Reinsurer of such disagreement and the
Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such disagreement. Any
resolution agreed to in writing by the Parties shall be final and binding
upon the Parties. If the Parties are unable to resolve any disagreement as to
the calculation of the Statutory Book Value of any Eligible Asset or whether
any asset is an Eligible Asset within ten (10) Business Days after the
Ceding Company delivers written notice of any such disagreement

 



\- 20 -  to the Reinsurer, the Parties shall jointly request the Independent
Accountant to determine the Statutory Book Value of the disputed Eligible
Asset or whether the disputed asset is an Eligible Asset as of the relevant
date. The Independent Accountants determination of the Statutory Book Value
of the disputed Eligible Asset or whether the disputed asset is an Eligible
Asset shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Each Party shall pay one-
half of the Independent Accountants fees, costs and expenses associated with
the Independent Accountants determination. After a final and binding
resolution of any dispute described in this _Section 4.8(b)_ is reached, the
Parties agree to make any necessary adjustments under _Section 4.8(a)_ so
that (i) absent the occurrence and continuation of a Triggering Event, the
aggregate Statutory Book Value of the Eligible Assets held in the
Trust Account is not less than the Required Balance, or (ii) during the
continuation of a Triggering Event, the aggregate Fair Market Value of the
Eligible Assets held in the Trust Account is not less than the Required
Balance.

 

Section 4.9. _Termination of Trust Account_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if the report required to be delivered by the Reinsurer as
described in _Section 4.8(a)_ demonstrates that the Required Balance is less
than or equal to $45,000,000,5 then (a) the Reinsurer and the Ceding Company
shall promptly deliver a Notice of Minimum Balance to the Trustee to terminate
the Trust Account and (b) the Reinsurer shall have no further obligation to
maintain any asset in the Trust Account pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 4.10. _Investment Guidelines and Policies_. The Reinsurer agrees to
direct the Trustee to invest the assets in the Trust Account in a manner
consistent in all material respects with the investment guidelines and
practices applied by the Reinsurer to the investment of investment assets
supporting similar types of insurance liabilities. The Reinsurer
shall certify in writing by January 31 of each year that it has complied with
the covenant in the preceding sentence.

Trust Agreements, the Ceding Company shall direct the Specified Trustees in
accordance with the terms of each Specified Trust Agreement to transfer all
income in respect of the Specified Trust Accounts directly to the Reinsurer,
as the designee of the Ceding Company, or to a separate account established
in the name and for the benefit of the Reinsurer, as the designee of the
Ceding Company.

 

Section 5.4. _ModCo Distribution Amount_.

 

(a) In connection with the reinsurance of the Liabilities described in clause
[(l)] of the definition of "Reinsured Liabilities" hereunder, the Reinsurer
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, any additional amounts required
to be deposited into the Specified Trust Accounts after the Effective Date
pursuant to the terms of the Specified Reinsured Contracts.
Without duplication of amounts transferred pursuant to _Section 5.3_, in the
absence of a recapture, the Ceding Company shall direct the Specified Trustees
to transfer directly to the Reinsurer all amounts to be distributed from the
Specified Trust Accounts at or after the Effective Time. The amounts payable
from the Specified Trust Accounts pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_ or this
_Section 5.4(a)_ are referred to herein as the " _Modco
Distribution Amounts_ ".

(b) Prior to the first quarter-end date after the Effective Time, the Parties
shall cooperate in good faith and mutually agree upon accounting requirements
for the Ceding Company and the Reinsurer to reflect the modified coinsurance
treatment of the Specified Reinsured Contracts hereunder in their respective
statutory financial statements; _provided_  that in no event shall either
Party be required to agree to any accounting treatment that is not in
accordance with applicable statutory accounting requirements.

 

Section 5.5. _Termination of Specified Trust Accounts_. The Reinsurer shall be
entitled to any distribution of the assets remaining in the Specified Trust
Accounts upon termination of the Specified Trust Agreements. The Ceding
Company shall direct the Specified Trustees to transfer such termination

Section 5.6. _Termination Agreement_. Upon the expiration or termination of
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, in the absence of a recapture,
any remaining ModCo Account Balance outstanding as of such date shall become
immediately due and payable to the Reinsurer.

 

ARTICLE VI.

 

OVERSIGHTS; COOPERATION

 

Section 6.1. _Oversights_. Inadvertent delays, oversights, errors or omissions
made in connection with this Agreement or any transaction hereunder shall not
relieve either Party from any liability that would have attached had such
delay, oversight, error or omission not occurred. The Parties shall
nevertheless cooperate in good faith to rectify such delay, oversight, error
or

 



\- 22 -  omission as soon as possible after discovery so that both Parties shall be
restored as closely as possible to the positions they would have occupied if
no delay, oversight, error or omission had occurred.

Section 6.2. _Cooperation_. The Ceding Company and the Reinsurer shall
cooperate with each other in order to accomplish the objectives of this
Agreement by furnishing additional information and executing and delivering
any additional documents as may be reasonably requested by the other to
further perfect or evidence the consummation of, or otherwise implement, any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements, or to aid in the preparation of any regulatory filing or financial
statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such additional documents must
be reasonably satisfactory to each Party and not impose upon either Party any
material liability, risk, obligation, loss, cost or expense not contemplated
by this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements.

 

ARTICLE VII.

 

INSOLVENCY

 

Section 7.1. _Insolvency of the Ceding Company_.

 

(a) In the event of the insolvency of the Ceding Company, all reinsurance
made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming effective under this Agreement
shall be payable by the Reinsurer directly to the named insureds or their
designees entitled to receive payment or cedents, as applicable, under the
Reinsured Contracts on the basis of the liability of the Ceding Company under
the Reinsured Contracts, as approved by the liquidation court, without
diminution because of the insolvency of the Ceding Company.

(b) It is understood, however, that in the event of such an insolvency of the
Ceding Company, the liquidator, receiver or statutory successor of the Ceding
Company shall give written notice of the pendency of a claim against the
Ceding Company on a Reinsured Contract within a reasonable period of time
after such claim is filed in the applicable insolvency proceedings and that
during the pendency of such claim the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and
interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be
adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may deem available to the Ceding
Company or its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor. It is further
understood that the expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer will
be chargeable, subject to Applicable Law and court approval, against the
Ceding Company as part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of a
proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Ceding Company
solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.

(c) In the event of a payment by the Reinsurer pursuant to this _Article VII_
, the Reinsurer shall be subrogated to all rights of the Ceding Company under
the Reinsured Contract, in each case to the extent of payments under this
_Article VII_.

 

Section 7.2. _Satisfaction and Discharge_. Any payment by the Reinsurer
pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be, to the extent of the payment, in
substitution, satisfaction and discharge of the Reinsurers obligations to the
Ceding Company, or to its receiver, liquidator, rehabilitator,

 



\- 23 -  conservator or similar Person or statutory successor, under this Agreement.
Neither this _Article VII_ , nor any other provision of this Agreement nor any
applicable Reinsured Contract, shall be construed in a manner which would
subject the Ceding Company or the Reinsurer to liability for duplicative
payment of Reinsured Liabilities reinsured under this Agreement. It is the
intent of the Parties to comply with Section 40-221a of the Kansas Insurance
Code and any successor statute or amendments thereto. To the extent this
_Section 7.2_ is deemed to be inconsistent with such Section, _Section
7.1(a)_ shall be amended and restated without any further action by the
Parties as follows:

"(a) In the event of the insolvency of the Ceding Company, all reinsurance
made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming effective under this Agreement
shall be payable by the Reinsurer directly to the Ceding Company or to its
domiciliary liquidator on the basis of the liability of the Ceding Company
under the Reinsured Contracts without diminution because of the insolvency of
the Ceding Company."

ARTICLE VIII.

 

DURATION; RECAPTURE

 

Section 8.1. _Duration_. This Agreement shall continue in force until such
time as (i) the Ceding Companys Liability arising out of or related to all
Reinsured Contracts is terminated in accordance with their respective terms,
or (ii) in accordance with _Section 8.3_, if the Ceding Company has elected
to recapture the reinsurance of Reinsured Contracts in full, and the Terminal
Settlement has been completed in accordance with _Section 8.4_.

 

Section 8.2. _Survival_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Article
VIII_ , the terms and conditions of  _Articles I_ , _VII_ and _VIII_ and the
provisions of _Sections 11.1_ , _11.4_ , _11.5_ , _11.10_ and _11.12_ shall
remain in full force and effect after the termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3. _Recapture_.

 

(a) During the continuation of a Triggering Event, the Ceding Company shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to recapture all, and not less than
all, of the reinsurance ceded under this Agreement, by providing the Reinsurer
with written notice of its intent to effect recapture. Recapture of the
Reinsured Contracts shall be effective on the tenth (10th) day following the
day on which the Ceding Company has provided the Reinsurer with such notice
or such later day as set forth in the Ceding Company recapture notice (the "
_Recapture Date_ "). Upon a recapture by the Ceding Company, the Ceding
Company will not recapture or otherwise be liable for any Reinsurer Extra-
Contractual Obligations, whether resulting from the Reinsurers actions as
Administrator under the Administrative Services Agreement or otherwise,
incurred before the Recapture Date.

 

(b) Following a recapture pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, subject to the
satisfaction of payment obligations described in  _Section 8.4_, both the
Ceding Company and the Reinsurer will be fully and finally released from all
rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Reinsured
Contracts, other than (i) the Reinsurers Extra Contractual Obligations under
the provisions that expressly survive termination as provided in _Section
8.2_ and (ii) the continued

 



\- 24 -  settlement of the Reinsured Liabilities incurred prior to the Recapture
Date. Following the consummation of the recapture, (A) no additional
Recoveries or other amounts payable under such Reinsured Contracts shall be
payable to the Reinsurer hereunder, nor, for the avoidance of doubt shall the
Reinsurer have any further right to receive any Recoveries, (B) the Reinsurer
(including in its capacity as Administrator) shall be relieved of on-going
responsibilities for servicing the Reinsured Contracts in accordance with the
terms of the Administrative Services Agreement, and (C) the Reinsurer shall
have no further obligations with respect to payment of claims, reinsurance of
Reinsured Risks or any other obligations whatsoever under this Agreement
except for obligations under the provisions that expressly survive termination
as provided in _Section 8.2_. Upon a recapture pursuant to this  _Section
8.3_, the Reinsurer shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to the Ceding
Company, effective as of the Recapture Date, all of Reinsurers right, title
and interest in the Recoveries and the security interest granted pursuant to
_Section 3.12_ shall be automatically released. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a recapture pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ will not affect unpaid
obligations or Liabilities due under any of the other Transaction
Agreements. 

(c) Notwithstanding the remedies contemplated by this _Article VIII_ or the
other Transaction Agreements, (i) the Ceding Company may, in its sole
discretion, require direct payment by the Reinsurer, and (ii) the Reinsurer
may, in its sole discretion, require direct payment by the Ceding Company, of
any sum in default under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement in
lieu of exercising the remedies in _Article VIII_ , and it shall be no defense
to any such claim that such Party might have had other recourse.

 

Section 8.4. _Recapture Payments_.

 

(a) In connection with a recapture pursuant to _Section 8.3_, the Reinsurer
shall prepare a settlement statement within fifteen (15) calendar days of the
Recapture Date (the " _Terminal Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth the
terminal settlement calculated in accordance with _Schedule B_ (the "
_Terminal Settlement_ "). If the undisputed amount of the Terminal Settlement
is positive, then within five (5) Business Days following the date on which
the Reinsurer delivers the Terminal Settlement Statement to the Ceding Company
(i) the Reinsurer and the Ceding Company shall instruct the Trustee pursuant
to the Trust Agreement to transfer to the Ceding Company assets with a Fair
Market Value equal to such undisputed amount to the extent not otherwise paid
by the Reinsurer in cash prior to such date (or if the assets in the Trust
Account are insufficient for such payment, instruct the Trustee to transfer
all assets remaining in the Trust Account to the Ceding Company) and (ii) if
the assets in the Trust Account are insufficient for payment of such
undisputed amount, the Reinsurer shall pay any shortfall to the Ceding Company
in cash. If the undisputed amount of the Terminal Settlement is negative, then
within five (5) Business Days following the date on which the Reinsurer
delivers the Terminal Settlement Statement to the Ceding Company the Ceding
Company shall pay such amount to the Reinsurer in cash. In addition, following
the Terminal Settlement, the Trust Account shall be terminated and any
remaining amounts or amount held in trust pursuant to _Article IV_ shall be
released to the Reinsurer after the full satisfaction of the Terminal
Settlement pursuant to the Terminal Settlement Statement. The Ceding Company
shall promptly take all actions, including providing written consent to the
Trustee, to permit such termination of the Trust Account and release of such
assets to the Reinsurer.

 



\- 25 - (b) In the event that the Ceding Company disagrees with the calculation of the
Terminal Settlement, the Ceding Company shall within ten (10) Business Days
after its receipt of such report deliver written notice to the Ceding Company
of such disagreement and the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
such disagreement. Any resolution agreed to in writing by the Parties shall
be final and binding upon the Parties. If the Parties are unable to resolve
any disagreement within ten (10) Business Days after the Reinsurer delivers
written notice of any such disagreement to the Ceding Company, the Parties
shall jointly request the Independent Accountant to determine the Terminal
Settlement in the manner provided in _Section 2.06_ of the Master Transaction
Agreement with respect to disputed items under a Notice of Disagreement (as
defined in the Master Transaction Agreement), _mutandis mutandis_. The
Independent Accountants determination of the Terminal Settlement shall be
final and binding upon the Parties. The fees, costs and expenses associated
with the Independent Accountants determination shall be allocated between the
Ceding Company and the Reinsurer in accordance with the Independent
Accountants judgment as to the relative merits of the Parties proposals
in respect of the dispute. After a final and binding resolution of any
dispute described in this _Section 8.4(b)_ is reached, the Parties agree to
make any necessary adjustments under _Section 8.4(a)_.

 

ARTICLE IX.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 9.1. _Reinsurer s Obligation to Indemnify_. The Reinsurer hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Ceding Company and its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees,
representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Ceding Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by the Ceding Company Indemnified Parties to the extent arising from
(i) any breach by the Reinsurer of the covenants and agreements of the
Reinsurer contained in this Agreement, (ii) written instructions and requests
of the Reinsurer pursuant to _Section 3.8_ or _Section 3.9_, (iii) any
Reinsurer Extra-Contractual Obligations, or (iv) any successful enforcement of
this indemnity.

 

Section 9.2. _Ceding Company s Obligation to Indemnify_. The Ceding Company
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Reinsurer and its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees,
representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Reinsurer
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by the Reinsurer Indemnified Parties to the extent arising from (i)
any breach by the Ceding Company of the covenants and agreements of the Ceding
Company contained in this Agreement, (ii) any Ceding Company Extra-
Contractual Obligations, or (iii) any successful enforcement of this
indemnity.

Section 9.3. _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than 30 days after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim)
thereof and such notice shall include a reasonable description of the

 



\- 26 -  claim based on facts known at the time and any documents relating to the
claim and an estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss and shall reference the
specific sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such claim to the
extent reasonably ascertainable; _provided_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced by such delay (except that the Indemnitor shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to
the Indemnitor, within five Business Days after the Indemnitees receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not as long as it
conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof subsequent to the
Indemnitor notifying the Indemnitee in writing of its election to assume such
defense. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnitee (A) for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed
the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee
shall have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above)
or (B) if the Third Party Claim involves conflicts of interest for the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor (in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnitee) that would make representation by the same counsel inappropriate,
in which event the Indemnitor shall be responsible for only one counsel for
the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the
other party hereto shall cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision
to the Indemnitor of records and information that are relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; provided, in each case, that such other party shall not be
obligated to provide such records, information or access to Indemnitor if
doing so would violate Applicable Law or jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege. Whether or not the Indemnitor shall have assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or pay, settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may
only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim with the
Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the Indemnitor may pay,
settle, compromise or discharge such a Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (i) includes a release of the
Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does
not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy, (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability
or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee and (iv) does not impose
any financial cost on the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor submits to the
Indemnitee a bona fide settlement offer with respect to a Third Party

 



\- 27 -  Claim that has been accepted by all Persons bringing such Third Party Claim
and otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth in the proviso of the
immediately preceding sentence and the Indemnitee refuses to consent to such
settlement, then thereafter the Indemnitors liability to the Indemnitee with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitors portion of
the settlement amount included in such settlement offer.

Section 9.4. _Direct Claims_. The Indemnitor will have a period of 30 days
within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account
of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor will
be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be
entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee.

Section 9.5.  _No Duplication of Indemnity_.

(a) Any payment arising under this _Article IX_ shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as the Indemnitee
shall designate to the Indemnitor in writing. To the extent that a Reinsurer
Indemnified Party or a Ceding Company Indemnified Party has received payment
in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to the provisions of any other
Transaction Agreement, such Reinsurer Indemnified Party or Ceding Company
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification for such
Indemnifiable Loss under this Agreement. In no event shall any Indemnitee (i)
be entitled to duplicate Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement and any
other Transaction Agreement attributable to the same underlying event giving
rise to such Indemnifiable Loss or Indemnifiable Losses, or (ii) initiate
duplicate proceedings under two or more Transaction Agreements seeking
recovery for the same Indemnifiable Loss or Indemnifiable Losses.

 

(b) If the Ceding Company has agreed to take any action or comply with any
obligation under the terms of this Agreement and such agreement to act or
comply is duplicative of either the Ceding Companys agreements or obligations
under the Master Transaction Agreement, then, in the event of any breach of
such agreement to act or comply, the Reinsurer shall only initiate proceedings
or otherwise pursue remedies available to it under the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 9.6. _Good Faith_. The Ceding Company and the Reinsurer each hereby
covenants and agrees that from and after the Closing Date it shall act in good
faith and deal fairly with each other in order to accomplish the objectives of
this Agreement, the Master Transaction Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements; _provided_ that each party hereto absolutely and irrevocably
waives resort to the duty of "utmost good faith" or any similar principle in
connection with the formation of this Agreement, the Master Transaction
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

ARTICLE X.

 

DAC TAX ADJUSTMENT

 

Section 10.1. _DAC Tax Adjustment_. To the extent that Section 848 of the Code
and corresponding Regulation 1.848-2 are applicable to the Reinsured
Contracts, the Ceding Company and Reinsurer hereby make the joint election
provided for in Regulation 1.848-2(g)(8) and agree as follows:

 

(a) The parties will attach a schedule to their federal income tax return
identifying the Agreement as a reinsurance agreement for which the foregoing
joint election applies. Such schedule shall be attached to each parties
federal income tax return filed for the first taxable year ending after the
election becomes effective.

 



\- 28 - (b) The party with the net positive consideration for this Agreement for each
taxable year will capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with
respect to this Agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation
of Code Section 848(c)(1).

 

(c) Both parties to this Agreement agree to exchange information pertaining to
the amount of the net consideration under this Agreement each year to ensure
consistency or as otherwise required by the Internal Revenue Service.

(d) Reinsurer will submit a schedule to the Ceding Company by April 1 of each
year providing Reinsurers calculation of the net consideration for the
preceding calendar year. This schedule will be accompanied by a statement
signed by an officer of Reinsurer stating that Reinsurer will report such net
consideration on its Tax return for the preceding calendar year.

(e) The Ceding Company may contest such calculation by providing an
alternative calculation to Reinsurer in writing within thirty (30) days of the
Ceding Companys receipt of Reinsurers calculation. If the Ceding Company
does not so notify Reinsurer, the Ceding Company will report the net
consideration as determined by Reinsurer in the Ceding Companys Tax return
for the previous calendar year.

 

(f) If the Ceding Company contests Reinsurers calculation of the net
consideration, the parties will act in good faith to reach an agreement as to
the correct amount within thirty (30) days of the date the Ceding Company
submits its alternative calculation. If the Ceding Company and Reinsurer reach
agreement on an amount of net consideration, each party shall report such
amount in their respective Tax returns for the previous calendar year, and if
the parties are not able to resolve the dispute by negotiation, the dispute
shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant within thirty (30) days of
the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accountant by the Ceding
Company or Reinsurer. The decision of the Independent Accountant shall be
final and binding, and the costs, expenses and fees of the Independent
Accountant shall be borne equally by the Ceding Company, on the one hand, and
Reinsurer, on the other hand.

(g) This joint election shall be effective for taxable years ending after the
Closing Date.

ARTICLE XI.

i TRUST AGREEMENT

 

THIS TRUST AGREEMENT, dated as of [●] (this " _Agreement_ "), is by and among
The United States Branch of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, entered
through the State of Michigan, the United States branch of Sun Life Assurance
Company of Canada, a stock life insurance company organized under the
Insurance Companies Act (Canada) (the " _Grantor_ "), Union Security
Insurance Company, an insurance company domiciled in the State of Kansas (the
" _Beneficiary_ "), and [Trustee], as trustee (such bank, in its capacity as
trustee, being referred to as the " _Trustee_ ").

_RECITALS_

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to a Coinsurance Agreement by and between the Beneficiary
and the Grantor dated as of the date hereof, (the " _Coinsurance Agreement_
"), the Beneficiary is ceding to the Grantor, and the Grantor is reinsuring
the Reinsured Risks (as defined in the Coinsurance Agreement) pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Coinsurance Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Coinsurance Agreement, the Grantor desires to
establish with the Trustee a trust account, in the name of the Grantor (the "
_Trust Account_ "), and transfer to the Trustee, for deposit in the Trust
Account, Assets (as hereinafter defined) to be made subject to this Agreement
in order to secure payment of amounts at any time and from time to time owing
by the Grantor to the Beneficiary under the Coinsurance Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Trustee has agreed to act as Trustee hereunder and, in
accordance with the terms hereof, to hold Assets in trust in the Trust Account
on the terms herein set forth; and

 

WHEREAS, this Agreement is made for the benefit of the Beneficiary and for the
purpose of setting forth the duties and powers of the Trustee with respect to
the Trust Account.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereby agree as follows:



   Section 1. | _Establishment of Trust Account; Initial Deposit_. _1_ 
---|--- 
 

(a) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Trustee shall establish a Trust Account in the Grantors name, and shall
administer the Trust Account as Trustee for the sole use and benefit of the
Beneficiary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Assets credited to
the Trust Account shall be subject to withdrawal by the Beneficiary and the
Grantor as set forth herein. The Trustee and its lawfully appointed



   1  |

Provisions may be added to this Agreement to govern the holding and
administration of mortgage loans.  

---|--- 
 



1  successors are authorized and shall have power to receive such Eligible
Assets as the Grantor (or the Beneficiary on behalf of the Grantor) transfers
to or vests in the Trustee or places under the Trustees possession and
control, and to hold, invest, reinvest, manage and dispose of the same for the
uses and purposes and in the manner and according to the provisions
hereinafter set forth. All such Eligible Assets at all times shall be
maintained in the Trust Account, separate and distinct from all other assets
of the Trustee, and shall be continuously maintained by the Trustee.

 

(b) On the date hereof, the Grantor (or the Beneficiary on behalf of the
Grantor) is transferring (or causing to be transferred) to the Trustee, for
deposit to the Trust Account, the Eligible Assets listed on _Exhibit A_
hereto, and after the date hereof, the Grantor may transfer to the Trustee,
for deposit to the Trust Account, additional Eligible Assets as it may from
time to time be required to deposit by this Agreement or the Coinsurance
Agreement (all such Eligible Assets in the Trust Account and proceeds thereof
are collectively " _Assets_ "). The Grantor, prior to depositing Eligible
Assets with the Trustee, shall execute or cause to be executed assignments,
endorsements in blank, or transfer legal title to the Trustee of all shares,
obligations or any other assets requiring assignment, in order that the
Beneficiary or the Trustee, upon the direction of the Beneficiary, may
whenever necessary negotiate any such Eligible Assets without the consent or
signature from the Grantor or any other Person.

 

(c) The Grantor hereby represents, warrants and covenants (i) that any assets
transferred by the Grantor to the Trustee for deposit to the Trust Account
will be in such form that the Beneficiary whenever necessary may, and the
Trustee upon direction by the Beneficiary may, negotiate any such assets
without consent or signature from the Grantor or any person in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) that all assets transferred by the
Grantor to the Trustee for deposit to the Trust Account will consist only of
Eligible Assets at the time of such transfer. The Trustee shall have no
responsibility whatsoever to determine at any time whether any Assets are or
continue to be Eligible Assets.

(d) The Trustee hereby confirms and agrees that:

 

(i) the Trustee shall not change the name or account number of the Trust
Account without the prior written consent of the Grantor and the Beneficiary;
and

(ii) all securities or other property that take the form of an instrument or
certificated security underlying any Assets credited to the Trust Account
shall be registered in the name of the Trustee or its nominee, endorsed to the
Trustee or in blank (either on the related instrument, on the certificated
security or on a stock power), with any powers and resolutions to the Trustee
as necessary for the Trustee to freely negotiate such securities.

(e) The Grantor hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the Beneficiary
that the Grantor will own its interest in the assets deposited by it into the
Trust Account (other than any assets deposited by the Beneficiary on behalf of
the Grantor, as to which the Grantor makes no representations or warranties)
free and clear of any security interest in, or lien or adverse claim on, such
assets, other than the beneficial interests in favor of the Beneficiary
created hereunder.

 



2 ---|--- 

(a) _Beneficiary Withdrawal_

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, but subject to
_Section 9(a)_, the Beneficiary shall have the right to withdraw Assets
valued at Fair Market Value from the Trust Account from time to time for
undisputed amounts due and unpaid by the Grantor under the Coinsurance
Agreement, to the extent such failure to pay remains uncured after
the expiration of the ten (10)-day cure period contemplated by Section 4.7(a)
of the Coinsurance Agreement following Grantors receipt of notice of failure
to pay undisputed amounts due thereunder (the " _Payment Default Notice_ ").
The Beneficiary is permitted to withdraw Assets from the Trust Account under
the preceding sentence, following delivery of written notice from a
Beneficiary Authorized Officer to the Trustee with a copy to the Grantor,
in accordance with _Section 2(a)(ii)_, substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B-1_ (a " _Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice_ "), specifying
the Assets or cash amount to be withdrawn. Any such withdrawals shall be for
an amount necessary to reimburse the Beneficiary for any undisputed amounts
due to the Beneficiary and not yet paid by the Grantor under the Coinsurance
Agreement (but not in excess of the amount specified in the related Payment
Default Notice) and may be utilized and applied by the Beneficiary (or any
successor by operation of law of the Beneficiary, including, without
limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the
Beneficiary) without diminution because of any insolvency, rehabilitation,
conservatorship or comparable status on the part of the Beneficiary or
Grantor, only for such purpose. Each withdrawal from the Trust Account by the
Beneficiary shall constitute a representation and certification of
the Beneficiary to the Grantor that such withdrawal is being made in
accordance with the terms of the Coinsurance Agreement and this Agreement. The
Beneficiary shall not deliver a Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice except as
expressly permitted by this  _Section 2(a)(i)_.

(ii) The occurrence of any one of the following four events subsequent to the
Beneficiary giving the Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice to the Trustee and the
Grantor shall be a condition precedent to the withdrawal of Assets by the
Beneficiary in accordance with the Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice delivered
under _Section 2(a)(i)_: 



     | (1) | Five (5) Business Days shall have elapsed from and including
the date on which the Trustee and the Grantor shall both have received a copy
of the Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice, and the Trustee shall not have received
any notice, given as provided in _Section 14_ hereof, from the Grantor
disputing the amount requested for withdrawal by the Beneficiary in the
Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | The Trustee shall have received a certificate signed by the
Beneficiary and the Grantor fixing and determining the amount of Assets, if
any, the Beneficiary may withdraw from the Trust Account; or 
---|---|--- 
 



3 Beneficiary certifying that a non-appealable award from an arbitration panel
or judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction has been entered specifying
the amount of Assets which the Beneficiary may withdraw from the Trust
Account, with a copy of such arbitration award or judgment attached; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | The Trustee shall have received, in the manner provided in
Section 14 hereof, written confirmation from the Grantor consenting to the
withdrawal requested in the Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice. 
---|---|--- 
 

The satisfaction of such condition precedent shall be the sole condition to
the withdrawal of such Assets by the Beneficiary. 

(b) _Grantor Withdrawal_

 

(i) If the aggregate Statutory Book Value of the Assets at the end of any
Accounting Period exceeds the Required Balance at the end of such Accounting
Period, the Grantor shall have the right to withdraw Assets from the Trust
Account, but only to the extent of such excess. The Grantor shall have the
right to withdraw Assets from the Trust Account pursuant to the
preceding sentence upon written notice from a Grantor Authorized Officer to
the Trustee with a copy to the Beneficiary in accordance with _Section
2(b)(ii)_, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B-2_ (a "
_Grantor Withdrawal Notice_ ") specifying the Assets or cash amount to be
withdrawn. Each withdrawal from the Trust Account by the Grantor shall
constitute a representation and certification of the Grantor to the
Beneficiary that such withdrawal is being made in accordance with the terms
of the Coinsurance Agreement and this Agreement. Following such withdrawal,
the aggregate Statutory Book Value of all Eligible Assets held in the Trust
Account shall be at least equal to the Required Balance as of the end of the
Accounting Period referenced in the first sentence of this _Section 2(b)(i)_.
The Grantor shall not deliver a Grantor Withdrawal Notice except as expressly
permitted by this Section 2(b)(i).

 

(ii) The occurrence of any one of the following four events subsequent to the
Grantor giving the Grantor Withdrawal Notice to the Trustee and the
Beneficiary shall be a condition precedent to the withdrawal of Assets by the
Grantor in accordance with the Grantor Withdrawal Notice delivered under
_Section 2(b)(i)_:

 



     | (1) | Five (5) Business Days shall have elapsed from and including
the date on which the Trustee and the Beneficiary shall both have received a
copy of the Grantor Withdrawal Notice, and the Trustee shall not
have received any notice, given as provided in _Section 14_ hereof, from the
Beneficiary disputing the amount requested for withdrawal by the Grantor in
the Grantor Withdrawal Notice; or 
---|---|--- 
 



4 the Beneficiary and the Grantor fixing and determining the amount of Assets,
if any, the Grantor may withdraw from the Trust Account; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) | The Trustee shall have received a certificate from the
Grantor certifying that a non-appealable award from an arbitration panel or
judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction has been entered specifying
the amount of Assets which the Grantor may withdraw from the Trust Account,
with a copy of such arbitration award or judgment attached; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | The Trustee shall have received, in the manner provided in
Section 14 hereof, written confirmation from the Beneficiary consenting to the
withdrawal requested in the Grantor Withdrawal Notice. 
---|---|--- 
 

The satisfaction of such condition precedent shall be the sole condition to
the withdrawal of such Assets by the Grantor.

 

(c) The party withdrawing Assets as permitted pursuant to _Sections 2(a)_ or
_2(b)_ shall be referred to herein as the " _Withdrawing Party_ " and the
Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice or the Grantor Withdrawal Notice, as applicable,
shall be referred to herein as a " _Withdrawal Notice_ ".

 

(d) Following receipt of a Withdrawal Notice, the Trustee shall promptly take
any and all steps necessary to transfer, absolutely and unequivocally, all
right, title and interest to the invested Assets or cash amount specified in
such Withdrawal Notice, and shall deliver such invested Assets or cash amount
as specified in such notice to the appropriate party. The Beneficiary
or Grantor (as applicable) shall acknowledge receipt of any such Assets
withdrawn upon request by the Trustee.

(e) The Trustee shall be fully protected in relying conclusively upon any
Withdrawal Notice or any other written demand, instruction, direction,
acknowledgment, statement, notice, resolution, request, consent, order,
certificate, report, appraisal, opinion, electronic mail, letter, or other
communication (collectively, " _Communications_ ") of the Beneficiary or the
Grantor, as applicable, for any such withdrawal that on its face conforms to
the requirements of this Agreement.

 

(f) Subject to _Section 3_ of this Agreement, in the absence of a Withdrawal
Notice, the Trustee shall allow no substitutions or withdrawals of any Asset
from the Trust Account. The parties hereto agree that the Trustee shall have
no responsibility whatsoever to determine that any Assets withdrawn from the
Trust Account pursuant to this _Section 2_ will be used and applied in the
manner contemplated therein.

 



5 (g) The Trustee may neither take, nor consent to the taking of, any action
which would or could result in the placement of any lien on any Assets. In
addition, the Trustee shall have no authority to assign, transfer, pledge, or
set off any of the Assets except as expressly permitted herein. Neither the
Grantor, nor the Trustee, nor their respective successors and assigns, shall
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, encumber or otherwise impair any of the
Assets except as stated under this Agreement.

 

(h) The Grantor may retain (and pay the service fees of) an investment manager
(which may be an affiliate of the Grantor) (the " _Investment Manager_ ") to
manage and make investment decisions with regard to any of the Assets held in
the Trust Account, and the Grantor agrees to provide reasonable advance
written notice to the Trustee and the Beneficiary of the appointment of each
Investment Manager so retained; _provided_ that the Grantor shall remain
responsible for all its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement
despite delegation of any such obligations or liabilities to such
Investment Manager and the Grantor shall be liable with respect to the
services to be provided by the Investment Manager as if provided by the
Grantor.



   Section 3. | _Redemption, Investment and Substitution of Assets_ _._ 
---|--- 

(a) The Trustee shall surrender for payment all maturing Assets and all
Assets called for redemption, deposit the principal amount of the proceeds of
any such payment to the Trust Account and provide notice of such payment to
the Beneficiary and the Grantor.

 

(b) From time to time, at the written order and direction of the Grantor or
its designated Investment Manager, and without consent of, or prior notice
to, the Beneficiary (but subject to _Section 3(c)_ below), the Trustee shall,
invest and reinvest the Assets in the Trust Account in Eligible Assets. The
Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine that
such designated investments constitute Eligible Assets, and may rely on the
direction of the Grantor or its designated Investment Manager.

(c) From time to time, the Grantor or its designated Investment Manager may
direct the Trustee to substitute Assets in the Trust Account, _provided_ that,
at the time of such substitution and after giving effect to such substitution,

Market Value of the Assets in the Trust Account is at least equal to the Fair
Market Value of the Assets in the Trust Account immediately prior to such
substitution and (ii) the Statutory Book Value of the Assets in the Trust
Account are at least equal to the Required Balance at the end of the
immediately preceding Accounting Period. The Trustee shall have no
responsibility whatsoever to determine the value of such substituted Assets
or that such substituted Assets constitute Eligible Assets.

(d) All investments and substitutions of Assets referred to in paragraphs (b)
and (c) of this Section shall be in compliance with the definition of
"Eligible Assets" in _Section 11_. Any instruction or order concerning such
investments or substitutions of Assets shall be referred to herein as an "
_Investment Order_." The Trustee shall execute Investment Orders and settle
securities transactions by itself or may utilize agents or brokers, including
Affiliates, and shall not be responsible for any act or omission, or for the
solvency, of any such agent or broker. The Grantor shall reimburse the Trustee
such fees and charges of such agent.

 



6 (e) When the Trustee is directed to deliver Assets against payment, delivery
will be made in accordance with generally-accepted market practice.

(f) Any loss incurred from any investment pursuant to the terms of this 
_Section 3_ shall be borne exclusively by the Trust Account. The Trustee
shall not be liable for any loss due to changes in market rates or penalties
for early redemption.

 



   Section 4. | _The Income Account._ 
---|--- 

All payments of interest, dividends and other income in respect of Assets
(the " _Income_ ") shall be posted and credited by the Trustee in the separate
income column of the custody ledger (the " _Income Account_ ") within the
Trust Account established and maintained by the Grantor at any office of the
Trustee in the United States. Any Income automatically posted and credited on
the payment date to the Income Account which is not subsequently received by
the Trustee shall be reimbursed by the Grantor to the Trustee and the Trustee
may debit the Income Account for this purpose. The Grantor may withdraw
amounts from the Income Account upon notice to the Trustee.



   Section 5. | _Taxes; Right to Vote Assets._ 
---|--- 

(a) The Grantor shall pay, prior to delinquency, all taxes, assessments and
other charges levied upon the Assets or the Trust Account and shall discharge
all liens against the Assets and the Trust Account; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that unless and until foreclosure, levy, sale or similar proceedings shall
have been commenced, the Grantor need not pay any such tax, assessment or
other charge so long as the validity thereof is contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and so long as security sufficient to pay such
tax, assessment or other charge (and any interest and penalties which may be
applicable thereon) has been provided to the Trustee to protect the
Beneficiary and the Trustee. In the event that the Grantor shall fail to pay
any such tax, assessment or other charge (and shall not be so contesting it)
or to discharge any such lien, the Beneficiary may, at its option, but shall
not be required to, make any payments necessary to pay such tax, assessment or
other charge or to discharge such lien, and the Grantor shall, upon demand,
reimburse the Beneficiary for the full amount of such payments (together with
interest from the date paid to but not including the date reimbursed at, a
fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime rate as announced by the
Trustee from time to time). The Trustee shall not be responsible for paying
any taxes, assessments or other charges or discharging liens on the Trust
Account or any of the Assets thereof.

 

(b) The parties hereto intend that the Trust Account be classified for United
States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust (pursuant to sections
671 through 677 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended). Each party
hereto agrees to treat the Trust Account as a grantor trust and the Grantor as
the owner of the Assets for all United States federal, state and local
tax purposes and, thus, any and all income derived from the Assets held in
the Trust Account shall constitute income or gain of the Grantor as owner of
such Assets. The Trustee shall not be authorized or empowered to do anything
that would cause the Trust Account to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or
the Grantor to fail to be treated as the owner of the Assets for such tax
purposes. The Trustee shall be responsible for any tax reporting, tax
withholding or other tax compliance required to be performed by the Trustee
on behalf of the Trust Account

 



7  pursuant to Applicable Law. The Grantor shall be responsible for any other
tax reporting, tax withholding or other tax compliance required on behalf of
the Trust Account and shall notify the Trustee of the tax identification
number of the Trust Account.

(c) The Trustee will transmit to the Grantor or its Investment Manager upon
receipt, and will instruct any entities authorized to hold Assets in
accordance with the terms hereof to transmit to the Grantor upon receipt, all
financial reports, stockholder communications, notices, proxies and proxy
soliciting materials received from issuers of Assets, and all information
relating to exchange or tender offers received from offerors with respect to
such Assets. The Grantor or its Investment Manager shall have the full
unqualified right to vote and execute consents and to exercise any and all
proprietary rights not inconsistent with this Agreement with respect to any
securities or other property forming a part of the Trust Account.



   Section 6. | _Additional Rights and Duties of the Trustee._ 
---|--- 

(a) The Trustee shall furnish to the Grantor and the Beneficiary a statement
of all Assets in the Trust Account upon the inception of the Trust Account and
at the end of each calendar month thereafter (the " _Monthly Statement_ ").
The Monthly Statement shall list (i) all of the Assets with CUSIP number (if
applicable) and other specific identifying information with respect to any
Asset that has no CUSIP number and (ii) any transfers of Assets to or from the
Trust Account during such calendar month, including all purchases and sales
of Assets during such calendar month. The Monthly Statement shall be given as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
the end of each calendar month. In addition, the Trustee shall provide daily
reporting to the Beneficiary, the Grantor or its designated Investment Manager
of the Assets in the Trust Account by granting access to the Trustees
automated data system affording on-line access to trust account information.

(b) Before accepting any asset for deposit to the Trust Account, the Trustee
shall determine that such asset is in such form that the Beneficiary whenever
necessary may, or the Trustee upon written direction by the Beneficiary may,
negotiate such asset without consent or signature from the Grantor or any
other Person other than the Trustee, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

(c) The Trustee shall notify the Grantor and the Beneficiary, within ten (10)
days, of any deposits to or withdrawals from the Trust Account.

(d) All Assets shall be held in a safe place by the Trustee in its office in
the United States, except that the Trustee may hold any Asset that is in
book-entry form as of the date it is credited to the Trust Account (a " _Book-
Entry Asset_ ") through the book-entry account maintained by the Trustee with
the related depository for such Book-Entry Asset (such a depository being
referred to herein as a " _Depository_ "). A Book-Entry Asset may be held in
the name of a nominee maintained by the Depository.

 

(e) The Trustee shall accept and may open all mail directed to the Grantor or
the Beneficiary in care of the Trustee. The Trustee shall promptly forward
all mail to the addressee whether or not opened.

 



8 (f) The Trustee shall keep full and complete records of the administration of
the Trust Account. Upon the reasonable written request of the Grantor or the
Beneficiary, the Trustee shall promptly permit the Grantor or the Beneficiary,
their respective agents, employees or independent auditors to examine, audit,
excerpt, transcribe and copy, at their own expense, during the Trustees
normal business hours any books, documents, papers and records relating to the
Trust Account or the Assets.

 

(g) The duties and obligations of the Trustee shall only be such as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement, as it may from time to time be
amended in accordance with the terms hereof, and no implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee. The Trustee
shall be liable only for its own fraud, negligence, willful misconduct or lack
of good faith. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Trustee is not liable
(i) for acting in accordance with or relying upon any instruction, notice,
demand, certificate or document contemplated by and given in accordance with
this Agreement from the Grantor or the Beneficiary, or (ii) for any
consequential, punitive or special damages.

(h) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Trustee to take any
action which, in the Trustees reasonable judgment, would result in any
violation of this Agreement or any provision of law. The Trustee shall
exercise the same due care that is expected of a fiduciary with
the responsibility for the safeguarding of the Assets in the Trust Account
and for compliance with all provisions of this Agreement, whether or not the
Assets are in the Trustees possession.

 

(i) The Trustee may confer with a nationally recognized outside law firm of
its selection in relation to matters arising under this Agreement. The
written opinion of such law firm shall be full and complete authority and
protection for the Trustee with respect to any action taken, omitted or
suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such law
firm.

 

(j) The parties hereto acknowledge that nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Trustee to risk or expend its own funds in performing
its obligations under this Agreement or obligate the Trustee to extend
credit, grant financial accommodation or otherwise advance moneys for the
purpose of making any payments or part thereof or otherwise carrying out any
instructions, including, without limitation, any Investment Order.

(k) The Trustee hereby waives any right of counterclaim, bankers lien, liens
or perfection rights as securities intermediary with respect to the Assets
and the Trust Account.



   Section 7. | _The Trustee s Compensation, Expenses and
Indemnification._ 
---|--- 

(a) The Grantor shall pay the Trustee, as compensation for its services under
this Agreement, a fee computed at its usual and customary rates for services
of this sort, as determined in good faith by the Trustee from time to time and
communicated to and agreed to in writing by the Grantor. The Grantor shall
also pay or reimburse the Trustee for all of the Trustees expenses and
disbursements in connection with its duties under this Agreement (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and reasonable accounting and
consulting fees and expenses), except any such expense or disbursement as may
arise from the Trustees negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith.

 



9 (b) The Grantor hereby indemnifies the Trustee for, and holds it harmless
against, any losses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and
reasonable consulting and accountants fees and expenses) incurred or paid
(other than as a result of the Trustees negligence, willful misconduct or
lack of good faith), arising out of or in connection with the performance of
its duties and obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation
any loss arising out of or in connection with the status of the Trustee in
connection with the performance of its duties and any nominee as the holder
of record of any or all of the Assets. The Grantor hereby acknowledges that
the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation of the Trustee or the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) No Assets shall be withdrawn from the Trust Account or used in any manner
for paying compensation to, or reimbursement or indemnification of, the
Trustee.

(d) The Trustee hereby waives any and all rights of offset, counterclaim and
recoupment against the Beneficiary and Trust Account, and waives any lien
(statutory or otherwise) that it may assert against the Trust Account.

(e) The Trustee hereby indemnifies each of the Grantor and the Beneficiary
for, and holds each of them harmless against, any losses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) directly arising out of the performance of the
Trustees obligations under this Agreement with respect to such party to the
extent resulting from the Trustees fraud, negligence, willful misconduct or
lack of good faith in the performance of responsibilities specifically
allocated to the Trustee by the terms of this agreement. The Trustee hereby
acknowledges that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation of
the Trustee or the termination of this Agreement.



   Section 8. | _Resignation of the Trustee._ 
---|--- 

(a) The Trustee may resign at any time by giving not less than ninety (90)
days written notice thereof to the Beneficiary and to the Grantor. The
Grantor and the Beneficiary jointly also may remove the Trustee at any time,
without assigning any reason therefor, on ninety (90) days prior written
notice thereof to the Trustee. Such resignation or removal shall become
effective on the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee and the
transfer to such successor Trustee of all Assets in the Trust Account in
accordance with paragraph (b) of this _Section 8_.

(b) Upon receipt of the Trustees notice of resignation or notice to the
Trustee of removal, the Grantor and the Beneficiary shall promptly appoint a
successor trustee. Any successor trustee shall be a bank that is a member of
the Federal Reserve System and shall not be a parent, a subsidiary or
an Affiliate of the Grantor or the Beneficiary. If a successor trustee has
not accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the notice of
resignation or removal, the Trustee may, in its sole discretion, apply at the
expense of the Grantor to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor trustee or for other appropriate relief. The costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by
the Trustee in connection with such proceeding shall be paid by, and be
deemed an obligation of, the Grantor. Upon the acceptance of the appointment
as trustee hereunder by a successor trustee, such successor trustee shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges

 



10  and duties of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be discharged from any
future duties and obligations under this Agreement, but the Trustee shall
continue after its resignation to be entitled to the benefits of the
indemnities provided herein for a Trustee for any actions taken as a Trustee
from the date of this Agreement until the date of discharge.

the Coinsurance Agreement, upon receipt of such certification by the Trustee,
the provisions of _Sections_ _2(a)_ , _2(b)_ and _3(c)_ hereof shall no longer

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Beneficiary shall
have the unconditional right to withdraw Assets valued at Fair Market Value
from the Trust Account at any time and from time to time, without notice to

Officers to the Trustee substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
B-1_ (a " _Beneficiary Withdrawal Notice_ "), for any of the purposes set

conditions or qualifications not contained in this Agreement.

Account in an amount not to exceed such excess, by delivering a written
notice from the Grantor Authorized Officers substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B-2_ (a " _Grantor Withdrawal Notice_ ") to the Trustee
with a copy to the Beneficiary. The Grantor Withdrawal Notice shall specify
the invested Assets or cash amount to be withdrawn. Each withdrawal from the
Trust Account by the Grantor shall constitute a representation and
certification of the Grantor to the Beneficiary that such withdrawal is being
made in accordance with the terms of the Coinsurance Agreement and this
Agreement.

 



11 (iii) _Section 3(c)_ shall be replaced with the following:

time of such substitution, the withdrawn Assets are replaced with other
Eligible Assets having a Fair Market Value at least equal to the Fair Market
Value of the Assets withdrawn. The Trustee shall have no responsibility
whatsoever to determine the value of such substituted Assets or that such
substituted Assets constitute Eligible Assets.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust Account created hereunder shall
continue in existence following the occurrence of a Triggering Event.
Following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Grantor shall ensure that
the Assets in the Trust Account have an aggregate Fair Market Value at least

   Section 16. | _Entire Agreement._ 
---|--- 

This Agreement, together with the Exhibits referred to herein and the
agreements referenced herein, contain the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements,
written or oral, with respect thereto.

 



   Section 17. | _Interpretation._ 
---|--- 

For purposes of this Agreement, the words " _hereof_ ," " _herein_ ," "
_hereby_ " and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a
whole unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the singular is used herein, the
same shall include the plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the
same shall include the singular, where appropriate. The term " _including_ "
means " _including but not limited to_." The word "or" shall not be exclusive.
Whenever used in this Agreement, the masculine gender shall include the
feminine and neutral genders. All references herein to Articles, Sections,
Subsections, Paragraphs and Exhibits shall be deemed references to Articles
and Sections and Subsections and Paragraphs of, and Exhibits to, this
Agreement unless the context shall otherwise require. Any reference herein to
any statute, agreement or document, or any section thereof, shall, unless
otherwise expressly provided, be a reference to such statute, agreement,
document or section as amended, modified or supplemented (including any
successor section) and in effect from time to time. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meaning when used in any Exhibit,
Schedule, certificate or other documents attached hereto or made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The parties intend that the
terms of this Agreement shall, to the fullest extent possible, be interpreted
and applied consistently with the terms of the Coinsurance Agreement. The
parties acknowledge and agree that, except as specifically provided herein,
they may pursue judicial remedies at law or in equity in the event of a
dispute with respect to the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the
provisions hereof without the aid of any canon, custom or rule of law
requiring or suggesting constitution against the party causing the
drafting of the provision in question.

 



18 ---|--- 

The headings in this Agreement are for reference only, and shall not affect
the interpretation of this Agreement.



   Section 19. | _Waivers and Amendments._ 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be amended, superseded, canceled, renewed or extended, and
the terms hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument signed by the
parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving compliance. No
delay on the part of any Party on exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver
on the part of any Party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.
The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and, unless provided
otherwise in this Agreement or the Coinsurance Agreement, are not exclusive of
any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.



   Section 20. | _Severability._ 
---|--- 

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be inoperative or unenforceable for any reason
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be so broad as to be unenforceable, that
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.



   Section 21. | _Execution in Counterparts._ 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof each
signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.
Each counterpart may be delivered by facsimile or electronic mail
transmission, which transmission shall be deemed delivery of an originally
executed document.
