&#147;<U>Survey</U>&#148; and collectively, the &#147;<U>Surveys</U>&#148;) to be performed at each Owned Real
Property listed on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.6</U>. If any such Title Commitment or Survey shows any
Encumbrances on any such Owned Real Property, other than Permitted Encumbrances, Sellers shall be
obligated to cure and or remove of record such Encumbrances at or prior to the Closing so that
Purchaser shall be able to obtain a policy of title insurance from the Title Company at the Closing
insuring title to such Owned Real Property in the condition required hereunder. In the event that
the Title Commitment or Survey for any such Owned Real Property reveals any Encumbrance that is not
a Permitted Encumbrance, and it becomes apparent that Sellers cannot or shall not cure or remove of
record such Encumbrance at or prior to Closing, Purchaser shall have the option to elect to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby with a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price in

ALTA policy (or applicable state required form) of extended title insurance issued by the Title
Company (or the unconditional commitment of the Title Company to issue such policy) for each Owned
Real Property listed on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.6</U> (i.e., one such policy for each such Owned Real
Property) effective as of the Closing Date (collectively, the &#147;<U>Title Policies</U>&#148;), with each
Title Policy being in the amount specified on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.7</U>. The Title Policies shall
insure Purchaser that fee simple interest in and to such Owned Real Properties is vested in
Purchaser, subject only to the printed terms and provisions of such Title Policies (as such terms
and provisions may be modified by endorsements purchased by Purchaser), the Permitted Encumbrances
expressly set forth on the final commitments for issuance of the Title Policies and any other
matters approved in writing by Purchaser. Sellers shall pay the portion of the premium for each
Title Policy that would be equal to a standard owner&#146;s policy of title insurance on each such Owned
Real Property covered by such Title Policy in the same face amount, and Purchaser shall pay any
additional premium for the extended coverage and for any endorsement on such Title Policy requested
by Purchaser. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for satisfying, at its cost, any requirement
of the Title Company for any Title Policy endorsement requested by Purchaser.

charges. If the Closing does not occur because of the termination of this Agreement by Purchaser
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.1(c)</U> or <U>(e)</U>, ParentCo shall be liable for all customary Real
Property Escrow cancellation charges. If the Close of Escrow does not occur for any other reason,
ParentCo and Purchaser shall each be liable for one-half (1/2) of all customary Real Property
Escrow cancellation charges.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">2.9 <U>Closing Costs and Recording Fees</U>. Upon the Closing, each of ParentCo and
Purchaser agrees to pay one-half (1/2) of all Real Property Escrow charges and recording fees,
other than with respect to the Title Policies, which shall be paid for as described in <U>Section
2.7</U>.
On or before the Closing Date, each of ParentCo and Purchaser shall deposit with the Title
Company cash in an amount sufficient to pay each such party&#146;s share of Title Policy premiums and
other Real Property Escrow-related costs; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U> that ParentCo may
instruct Purchaser to pay ParentCo&#146;s share of such costs and deduct the same amount from the

attributable to the period up to and including the Closing Date for electricity, water, gas and any
other utilities servicing the Owned Real Properties and Acquired Leased Real Properties, and for
separate billing to Purchaser for all such charges attributable to the period beginning on the day
after the Closing Date. If any such separate billing cannot be arranged by the Closing Date, such
charges shall be equitably prorated on the basis of the most recent ascertainable invoices or
statements for such services. With respect to any utilities in place and servicing the Owned Real
Properties and Acquired Leased Real Properties as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall endeavor to
have the respective utility providers read the meters for the utilities such that the prorations
can be made based on such final meter readings. If such meter readings cannot be obtained in such
manner, charges for utilities shall be prorated by good faith estimation as of the Closing Date
based on the per diem rate obtained by using the last available billing period and associated bills
for such utilities. Once all applicable utility billings have been delivered after the Closing
Date and an accurate proration of utility charges can be determined therefrom, the net amount
payable to Sellers or Purchaser (as applicable) after combining such prorations shall be paid
concurrently with the payment due under <U>Section&nbsp;1.11(e)</U> after determining the Final Price
Adjustment.
