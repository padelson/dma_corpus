compliance of such Seller with any applicable Law (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer"
Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to

however, that pursuant to section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer
of the Transferred Assets shall be free and clear of any Encumbrance arising
under any bulk transfer laws, and the parties shall take such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to so provide in the Sale Approval Order).

Value Shortfall (if any), and _minus_ the amount of any Unauthorized
Indebtedness, in each case as determined pursuant to _Section 1.11_

_Section 2.10)_ (the " _Closing Payment_ ") as follows: 

  

(a) first, to the extent of Purchasers interest as assignee of Fleetwood
under the DIP Facility, by way of credit and set-off against the outstanding
balance of the DIP Facility as of the time of Closing (provided, that if the
Closing Payment is less than the total outstanding balance of the DIP
Facility as of the time of Closing, such outstanding balance and any
subsequent interest accruals thereon shall remain payable by Sellers in
accordance with the provisions of the DIP Facility); and 

  

(b) second, to the extent the Closing Payment exceeds the outstanding balance
of the DIP Facility as of the time of Closing, by wire transfer of

place or at such other time or on such other date as ParentCo and Purchaser
may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place
being the " _Closing Date_ ").

_Sections 1.1(a)_ and _1.3(a)_ , (i) at the Closing, but effective as of the

to sections 363(b), (f) and (m) and section 365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code
each of the Assumed Contracts that may be assumed pursuant to the Sale
Approval Order, and (ii) to the extent contemplated in _Section 1.3(a)_ (and

course pay, discharge, perform and satisfy in accordance with their
respective terms all of the obligations under such Assumed Contracts pursuant
to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code from and after the Closing, and shall
pay the Cure Costs so that all applicable Assumed Contracts may be assigned
to Purchaser pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. 

  

1.11 _Base Price Adjustment_. The adjustment to the Base Price with respect to
the valuation of the Inventory and the Accounts Receivable of Sellers and any
Unauthorized Indebtedness shall be determined in accordance with the
following provisions: 

  

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, ParentCo shall
deliver to Purchaser a report setting forth (i) a good faith estimate as of
the Effective Time of the Inventory and the Accounts Receivable of Sellers
and any Unauthorized Indebtedness, based on current information then
reasonably available to Sellers and broken down on a line-item
basis, together with reasonable documentation in support of such estimate
(including at a minimum a complete aging report of all Accounts Receivable of
Sellers and a report of all Inventory, with such Accounts Receivable and
Inventory reports being the most recently available accounts receivable
report and inventory report before such date of delivery by ParentCo) and,
based thereon, any downwards adjustment to be made to the Base Price for
purposes of determining the Closing Payment as contemplated by _Section 1.6_
(the " _Initial Price Adjustment_ "). The Initial Price Adjustment (or
ParentCos determination that no Initial Price Adjustment is required) shall
be subject to the review and approval of Purchaser upon receipt, acting
reasonably and in good faith (which approval shall be for Closing purposes
only and shall not constitute Purchasers acceptance of the Initial Price
Adjustment (or ParentCos determination that no Initial Price Adjustment is
required) as definitive), and Purchaser shall have two (2) Business Days
to submit to ParentCo any objection to the Initial Price Adjustment (or
ParentCos determination that no Initial Price Adjustment is required),
provided that such objection must be submitted in writing setting forth in
reasonable detail Purchasers objection; and provided further that such
objection may only be based on (i) the failure of ParentCo to provide
adequate back-up information or documentation for the Initial Price
Adjustment, (ii) a deviation from available financial information on which
the Initial Price Adjustment is to be based, (iii) the failure of the Initial
Price Adjustment to be calculated in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement, (iv) the failure of the Initial Price Adjustment to be calculated
in accordance with GAAP (except as such failure is expressly permitted or
required pursuant to this Agreement), or (v) calculation error. During such
two (2)-day period, ParentCo shall provide Purchaser and its
Representatives with access to the relevant books, records and personnel of
Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Purchaser to
assist Purchaser in its review of the Initial Price Adjustment. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
ParentCo a report showing (i) Purchasers determination, as of the Effective
Time, of the Inventory and Accounts Receivable of Sellers and any
Unauthorized Indebtedness existing as of the Effective Time, which report
shall be in reasonable detail and broken down on a line-item basis, together
with reasonable documentation in support of such determination (including at
a minimum a complete aging report of all Accounts Receivable of Sellers and a
report of all Inventory, with such Accounts Receivable and Inventory reports
having been prepared as of the Effective Time) and, based thereon, any
downwards adjustment to be made to the Base Price for purposes of determining
the Purchase Price (the " _Post-Closing Price Adjustment_ "). ParentCo shall
have ten (10) days after its receipt of the Post-Closing Price Adjustment to
give written notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Purchaser of any objection
to the Post-Closing Price Adjustment. Any Objection Notice must specify in
reasonable detail the objections of ParentCo and may only be based on (i) the
failure of Purchaser to provide adequate back-up information or documentation
for the Post-Closing Price Adjustment, (ii) a deviation from available
financial information on which the Post-Closing Price Adjustment is to be
based, (iii) the failure of the Post-Closing Price Adjustment to be
calculated in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, (iv) the
failure of the Post-Closing Price Adjustment to be calculated in accordance
with GAAP (except as such failure is expressly permitted or required pursuant
to this Agreement), or (v) calculation error. During such ten
(10)-day period, Purchaser shall provide ParentCo and its Representatives
with access to the relevant books, records and personnel of Purchaser
reasonably requested by ParentCo to assist ParentCo in its review of the
Post-Closing Price Adjustment. 

  

(c) If, within the ten (10)-day period referred to in _Section 1.11(b)_, an
Objection Notice that meets the requirements of _Section 1.11(b)_ is
delivered by ParentCo to Purchaser, Representatives of ParentCo and Purchaser
shall confer in good faith for up to ten (10) days after the date of
Purchasers receipt of the Objection Notice to resolve the objections
raised by ParentCo. If such Representatives are unable to resolve all such
objections within such period, then at any time thereafter, ParentCo or
Purchaser may require that the objection raised by ParentCo be immediately
submitted to the Bankruptcy Court for resolution, whereupon the parties shall
cooperate reasonably and in good faith to establish fast-track procedures for
presenting their respective positions to the Bankruptcy Court. Any
determination of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the matters that are
the subject of ParentCos objection shall be final, binding and conclusive on
the parties hereto. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) Upon the first to occur of, (i) the written agreement between ParentCo and
Purchaser as to the Post-Closing Price Adjustment, including any amendment to
be made thereto, (ii) the passage of the thirty (30)-day (or more, if
mutually agreed upon by ParentCo and Purchaser) period after ParentCo has
received the Post-Closing Price Adjustment without ParentCos delivery of an
Objection Notice (in which case ParentCo shall be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the Post-Closing Price Adjustment), or (iii) the determination of
the Bankruptcy Court of all matters that are the subject of an Objection
Notice, the final adjustment to be made to the Base Price based on the value,
as of the Effective Time, of the Inventory and Accounts Receivable of Sellers
and any Unauthorized Indebtedness, as finally determined pursuant to one
or more of the foregoing (the " _Final Price Adjustment_ ") shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. 

  

(e) If the amount of the Final Price Adjustment is less than the amount of the
Initial Price Adjustment, then, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Price Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall pay to
ParentCo, on behalf of Sellers, the amount of such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account referred to in
_Section 1.6(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser
be required to pay more than the Base Price as the total Purchase Price due
to Sellers. If the amount of the Final Price Adjustment Amount exceeds the
amount of the Initial Price Adjustment, then, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Price Adjustment, ParentCo, on behalf
of Sellers, shall refund to Purchaser the amount of such shortfall by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account specified by
Purchaser in writing to ParentCo. 

   

1.12 _Valuation and Treatment of Uncollectable Accounts Receivable_. 

  

(a) For purposes of calculating the Initial Price Adjustment, the Post-Closing
Price Adjustment and the Final Price Adjustment, and any adjustment to the
Base Price as contemplated in  _Section 1.11_, the Accounts Receivable of
Sellers shall be valued by the parties in the following manner: 

  

(i) subject to _Section 1.12(a)(ii)_, one hundred percent (100%) of the
amount of any Account Receivable shall be counted if, as of the Effective
Time, such Account Receivable is aged ninety (90) or less days from the
earlier of (A) the date of issuance of the statement or invoice therefor or
(B) the date on which such Account Receivable first became payable; and 

  

(ii) no value shall be given to any Account Receivable that, as of the
Effective Time, is aged more than ninety (90) days from the earlier of (A)
the date of issuance of the statement or invoice therefor or (B) the date on
which such Account Receivable first became payable, or any Account Receivable
that is owing by an account debtor that is bankrupt, in receivership or
insolvent or has ceased to conduct business or is disputing such Account
Receivable. 

  

(b) If, within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser has been
unable to collect any Seller Account Receivable (or portion thereof) referred
to in _Section 1.12(a)(i)_, Purchaser may, prior to or concurrently with its
delivery to ParentCo of the Post-Closing Price Adjustment, assign such
uncollected Account Receivable (or portion thereof) back to the
applicable Seller. The stated amount of any such uncollectible Account
Receivable, to the extent included in the calculation of the Initial Price
Adjustment, shall not be counted in the current assets included in the
calculation of the Post-Closing Price Adjustment and the Final Price
Adjustment. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.13 _Allocation of Proceeds_. Purchaser shall within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the Closing Date prepare and deliver to ParentCo a schedule
reasonably allocating the Purchase Price among the Transferred Assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Tax Code (such schedule, the "
_Allocation_ "). Purchaser shall permit ParentCo to review and
provide comments on the Allocation and shall consult with ParentCo with
respect to any such comments. However, the Allocation shall be finally
determined in Purchasers sole discretion. Purchaser and Sellers shall report
and file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for
refund) in all respects and for all purposes in a manner consistent with the
Allocation. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall take any position contrary
thereto or inconsistent therewith (including in any audits or examinations by
any Governmental Body or any other proceeding) unless otherwise required by
applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) each party to this Agreement
shall notify the other parties in the event that any Governmental Body takes
or proposes to take a position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with
such Allocation and (ii) ParentCo and its Affiliates shall not be bound by
the Allocation for purposes of allocating the Purchase Price in connection
with proceeds of the sale of the Transferred Assets and any claims related
thereto under the Bankruptcy Case. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in
the filing of any forms (including Form 8594 under Section 1060 of the Tax
Code) with respect to the Allocation.

so that Purchaser shall be able to obtain a policy of title insurance from
the Title Company at the Closing insuring title to such Owned Real Property
in the condition required hereunder. In the event that the Title Commitment
or Survey for any such Owned Real Property reveals any Encumbrance that is
not a Permitted Encumbrance, and it becomes apparent that Sellers cannot or
shall not cure or remove of record such Encumbrance at or prior to Closing,
Purchaser shall have the option to elect to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby with a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price in an
amount necessary to cure or remove such Encumbrance at the Closing. 

  

2.7 _Title Policies_. At the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser an
owners ALTA policy (or applicable state required form) of extended title
insurance issued by the Title Company (or the unconditional commitment of the
Title Company to issue such policy) for each Owned Real Property listed on
_Schedule 2.6_ (i.e., one such policy for each such Owned Real Property)
effective as of the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Title Policies_ "),
with each Title Policy being in the amount specified on _Schedule 2.7_. The
Title Policies shall insure Purchaser that fee simple interest in and to such
Owned Real Properties is vested in Purchaser, subject only to the printed
terms and provisions of such Title Policies (as such terms and provisions may
be modified by endorsements purchased by Purchaser), the Permitted
Encumbrances expressly set forth on the final commitments for issuance of the
Title Policies and any other matters approved in writing by Purchaser.
Sellers shall pay the portion of the premium for each Title Policy that would
be equal to a standard owners policy of title insurance on each such
Owned Real Property covered by such Title Policy in the same face amount, and
Purchaser shall pay any additional premium for the extended coverage and for
any endorsement on such Title Policy requested by Purchaser. Purchaser shall
be solely responsible for satisfying, at its cost, any requirement of the
Title Company for any Title Policy endorsement requested by Purchaser. 

  

2.8 _Real Property Escrow Cancellation Charges_. If the Closing does not occur
because of the termination of this Agreement by Sellers (or any of them)
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ or _(e)_ , Purchaser shall be liable for all
customary Real Property Escrow cancellation charges. If the Closing does not
occur because of the termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ or _(e)_ , ParentCo shall be liable for all customary
Real Property Escrow cancellation charges. If the Close of Escrow does not
occur for any other reason, ParentCo and Purchaser shall each be liable for
one-half (1/2) of all customary Real Property Escrow cancellation charges. 

  

2.9 _Closing Costs and Recording Fees_. Upon the Closing, each of ParentCo
and Purchaser agrees to pay one-half (1/2) of all Real Property Escrow
charges and recording fees, other than with respect to the Title Policies,
which shall be paid for as described in _Section 2.7_. On or before the
Closing Date, each of ParentCo and Purchaser shall deposit with the
Title Company cash in an amount sufficient to pay each such partys share of
Title Policy premiums and other Real Property Escrow-related costs;
_provided_ , _however_ that ParentCo may instruct Purchaser to pay ParentCos
share of such costs and deduct the same amount from the Closing Payment. 

  

    ##### 

  

   

2.10 _Apportionments for Real Properties_. The following apportionments shall
be made between Sellers and Purchaser as of the Effective Time (the "
_Closing Apportionments_ ") based on the latest available information, and
the amounts derived therefrom shall be (as applicable) added to or deducted
from the Closing Payment in accordance with _Section 1.6_: 

  

(a) _Taxes and Assessments_. Real estate Taxes, ad valorem Taxes, personal
property Taxes, transaction privilege Taxes, and other similar Taxes related
to the ownership and/or operation of each Owned Real Property shall be
prorated between the applicable Seller or Transferred Subsidiary and
Purchaser and set forth on (i) the Closing Statement applicable to such Owned
Real Property, if owned by a Seller or (ii) for any Owned Real Property owned
by a Transferred Subsidiary or any Leased Real Property in respect of which
the Real Property Lease is included in the Assumed Contracts (each, an "
_Acquired Leased Real Property_ "), a written statement agreed to by ParentCo
and Purchaser. Sellers shall be responsible for all Taxes attributable to the
Owned Real Properties and Acquired Leased Real Properties through and
including the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be responsible for such Taxes
attributable to the Owned Real Properties and Acquired Leased Real Properties
beginning the first day after the Closing Date. If any current assessments,
statements or other necessary information on any such amounts are
not available before the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser shall agree upon
reasonable estimates of such amounts based on prior amounts assessed against
or paid by the applicable Sellers. 

  

(b) _Utilities_. Purchaser and Sellers agree to use their respective
reasonable efforts to arrange, before the Closing Date, for separate billing
to the applicable Sellers of all charges attributable to the period up to and
including the Closing Date for electricity, water, gas and any other
utilities servicing the Owned Real Properties and Acquired Leased Real
Properties, and for separate billing to Purchaser for all such charges
attributable to the period beginning on the day after the Closing Date. If
any such separate billing cannot be arranged by the Closing Date,
such charges shall be equitably prorated on the basis of the most recent
ascertainable invoices or statements for such services. With respect to any
utilities in place and servicing the Owned Real Properties and Acquired
Leased Real Properties as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall endeavor to have
the respective utility providers read the meters for the utilities such that
the prorations can be made based on such final meter readings. If such meter
readings cannot be obtained in such manner, charges for utilities shall be
prorated by good faith estimation as of the Closing Date based on the per
diem rate obtained by using the last available billing period and associated
bills for such utilities. Once all applicable utility billings have been
delivered after the Closing Date and an accurate proration of utility charges
can be determined therefrom, the net amount payable to Sellers or Purchaser
(as applicable) after combining such prorations shall be paid concurrently
with the payment due under _Section 1.11(e)_ after determining the Final
Price Adjustment. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) _Form 1099-B_. If applicable to the sale and purchase of the Owned Real
Properties as contemplated herein, the Title Company is hereby authorized and
instructed to file as the " _Reporting Person_ " Internal Revenue Service
Form 1099-B, Proceeds from Real Estate, Broker, and Barter Exchange
Transactions, as required by § 6045(d) of the Tax Code.

business as presently conducted. No Seller or Transferred Subsidiary is the
subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened action or
proceeding for or contemplating the suspension, termination, modification,
limitation, cancellation, revocation, nonrenewal or impairment of any of its
Permits. Except for the filing of the Bankruptcy Case, Sellers have

obtained, no Permit held by any Transferred Subsidiary shall be suspended,

timely paid by Sellers. Sellers shall be responsible for all income, profit
and similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the sale of the
Transferred Assets by Sellers. Purchaser shall provide Sellers with resale
exemption certificates as are appropriate and available to Purchaser
under applicable Law. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in the filing of
all necessary documentation and all Tax Returns with respect to all such
Taxes, including any available pre-sale filing procedure. 

  

(c) _Cooperation_. The parties hereto shall cooperate reasonably with each
other and with each others respective Representatives, including accounting

Tax Return(s) and any Tax claim or litigation in respect of the Transferred
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or any of the assets or Liabilities of any

activities, operations or events on or prior to the Closing Date, which
cooperation shall include making available employees, if any, for the purpose
of providing testimony and advice, or original documents, or either of them;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such cooperation shall be conditioned on the

employees who provide such cooperation, (ii) travel costs of such employees
incurred in connection with providing such cooperation, (iii) reasonable
costs of document retrieval, review and/or delivery incurred in providing

5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the earlier of the Closing or
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any fact, change,
condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which
it is aware that shall or is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ becoming incapable
of being satisfied. In furtherance of the foregoing, ParentCo (on behalf of
Sellers) shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of (i) the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event that would cause either (A) any representation or
warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect at any time after the date hereof, or (B) directly
or indirectly, any Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any material failure of
Sellers to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by them hereunder, or (iii) the termination of
employment of any senior manager or the termination of employment or furlough
of any material number of employees of any Seller or Transferred
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall not (x) be deemed to amend or
supplement any Schedule to this Agreement, (y) be deemed to cure any breach
of any representation, warranty covenant or agreement or to satisfy any
condition, or (z) limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice. 

  

5.11 _Knowledge of Breach_. If prior to the Closing Purchaser shall have
reason to believe that any breach of a representation or warranty of Sellers
has occurred (other than through notice from ParentCo), Purchaser shall
promptly so notify ParentCo, in reasonable detail. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this _Section 5.11_, shall imply that Sellers are making any
representation or warranty as of any date other than the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

5.12 _Employment Arrangements_. 

  

(a) _Future Employment_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser may offer employment
to those of Sellers current employees as Purchaser shall determine in its
sole discretion. All such offers of employment shall be subject to such
compensation and other terms of employment as Purchaser shall determine in
its sole discretion. Each such Seller employee who accepts Purchasers offer
of employment and is hired by Purchaser is referred to herein as a "
_Transferred Seller Employee_ ". On the Closing Date, the applicable Sellers
shall terminate the employment of each Transferred Seller Employee and
Purchaser shall commence its employment of such Transferred Seller Employee.
If Purchaser does not wish to offer employment to any employee of a Seller or
if Purchaser offers such employment but any employee of a Seller refuses to
be employed by Purchaser, the applicable Seller may elect to retain or
terminate such employee, but such Seller shall be solely liable for all costs
of any retention or termination of such employees employment. 

  

(b) _No Right to Employment_. Notwithstanding _Section 5.12(a)_, nothing
herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the employees of any
Seller or Transferred Subsidiary or any Transferred Seller Employees any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

(c) _No Obligation_. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have
any Liability whatsoever for (i) any compensation or other obligations
actually or purported to be owing to any Transferred Seller Employee by any
Seller, including any severance, separation pay, change of control payments
or benefits, retention payments or any other payments or benefits arising in
connection with such employees employment by, or termination of employment
with, any Seller before, on or after the Closing Date, or (ii) any Claim
under the WARN Act or any similar state or local Law by any past or present
employee of any Seller (whether or not a Transferred Seller Employee) in
connection with Sellers pre-Closing conduct of the Business or any
other business, including any plant closing or mass layoff. 

  

(d) _Sellers  Cooperation in Review and Hiring of Employees_. Subject to
applicable Law and prior approval and arrangements in advance by and through
one or more executive officers of ParentCo, not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser and shall permit Purchaser
a reasonable period during normal business hours prior to the Closing
Date, (i) to meet with employees of Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries
(including managers and supervisors) at such times as Purchaser shall
reasonably request, (ii) to speak with such employees managers and
supervisors (in each case with appropriate authorizations and releases
from such employees) who are being considered for employment (or in the case
of the Transferred Subsidiaries, continued employment) by Purchaser, (iii) to
distribute to such employees such forms and other documents relating to
potential employment (or continued employment) after the Closing; and (iv)
subject to any restrictions imposed under applicable Law, to permit
Purchaser, upon request, to review personnel files and other relevant
employment information regarding such employees. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) _Post-Closing Cooperation on Employee Compensation and Benefits_.
Following the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate reasonably with
each other to provide an orderly administrative transition to Purchaser of
the Transferred Seller Employees and the employees of the Transferred
Subsidiaries, including (i) the provision by Sellers to Purchaser of all
necessary or appropriate documents, records, materials, accounting files and
Tax information with respect to the Transferred Seller Employees and the
employees of the Transferred Subsidiaries, and (ii) Sellers causing their
Employee Benefit Plan providers to assist in the conversion and rollover of
employee benefits for Transferred Seller Employees and the employees of the
Transferred Subsidiaries to Purchasers applicable Employee Benefit Plans,
including medical, dental, short-term disability, long-term disability, life
insurance and 401(k) plans. ParentCo shall provide Purchaser
with Certificates of Credible Coverage for all health plan participants under
any applicable Employee Benefit Plan of Sellers and/or the Transferred
Subsidiaries within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. Sellers and
Purchaser agree to utilize the standard procedure set forth in IRS Revenue
Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting for Transferred Seller
Employees, such that Sellers shall be responsible for all reporting of wages
and other compensation paid by it to Transferred Seller Employees before the
Closing Date (including furnishing and filing of Forms W-2 and W-3). 

  

(f) _Sellers to Retain COBRA Liability_. At the Closing, to the extent
required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall assume Sellers obligations to
provide health care continuation coverage under Tax Code §4980B and ERISA
§601 for all MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (as that term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4) of Sellers; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that such assumption of Sellers obligations shall apply only to MandA
Qualified Beneficiaries who timely elect to receive COBRA coverage through
Purchaser and only with respect to claims incurred by such MandA Qualified
Beneficiaries after the Closing Date (it being understood and agreed by the
parties hereto that any claim incurred (whether or not reported) by an MandA
Qualified Beneficiary on or before the Closing Date shall constitute an
Excluded Liability). 

  

5.13 _Insurance_. Between the date hereof and the earlier of the Closing Date
or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
Sellers shall, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, at their
cost, keep in effect and in good standing all policies of insurance
maintained by any of them to insure the Business, the Transferred Assets
and the assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Existing
Insurance Policies_ "). To the extent that any Existing Insurance Policy
insures against any loss, Liability, Claim, damage or expense resulting from,
arising out of, based on or relating to occurrences arising on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing with respect to the Business, the
Transferred Assets or the assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries and permit
claims to be made thereunder with respect to such losses, Liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses after the Closing, Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an insurance certificate naming
Purchaser as an additional insured under the Existing Insurance Policies. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

5.14 _Licensed Computer Software; Consents_. Prior to and (if necessary)
following the Closing, to the extent requested by Purchaser, Sellers shall
cooperate reasonably and in good faith to assist Purchaser with obtaining any
required third-party consent, waiver or approval for (i) Sellers assignment
and transfer to Purchaser of the licensed Computer Software to be included in
the Transferred Assets, and (ii) if applicable, the change of control of
any Transferred Subsidiary that is a party to any Computer Software license
where such license provides that a change of control constitutes a deemed
assignment of such license requiring the consent of the licensor or otherwise
requires such licensors consent or would permit such licensor to terminate
such license; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Seller shall be required to
pay any transfer fee or similar payment to obtain any such consent, waiver or
approval. If any such consent, approval or waiver which is required in order
to assign any licensed Computer Software to be included in the Transferred
Assets is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, or if an
attempted assignment would be ineffective or would adversely affect the
ability of any Seller to convey its interest in question to Purchaser,
Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in good faith and in a reasonable
manner in any lawful arrangement to provide that Purchaser shall receive the
interests of any Seller in the benefits of such licensed Computer Software;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if such consent, waiver or approval is not
obtained before the Closing Date, it shall not be an impediment or condition
to any partys obligation to consummate the Closing under this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for obtaining
any approvals, waivers or consents (and paying any fees or costs) related to
the assignment to (or permitted use by) Purchaser of any licensed Computer
Software to be included in the Transferred Assets. 

  

5.15 _Seller Release of Claims Against Transferred Subsidiaries_. Effective as
of the time of Closing, Sellers hereby unconditionally waive, release and
discharge each Transferred Subsidiary from and against any and all Claims and
Liabilities, whether or not known to Sellers (or any of them) as of the
Closing Date, including any Claim or Liability arising under the
Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable Law. 

  

5.16 _Change of Purchaser s Name; Dissolution_. Within two (2) Business Days
following the earlier of (i) the date on which Purchaser is not selected as
the winning bidder in the sale auction for the Transferred Assets
contemplated by the Bidding Procedures and is not selected by the Bankruptcy
Court as the back-up purchaser for the Transferred Assets in the event that
the successful bidder in the sale auction fails to close its purchase of the
Transferred Assets that it agrees to purchase, or (ii) the date on which
ParentCo notifies Purchaser in writing of the completion of closing of the
sale of Transferred Assets to either the third-party winning bidder in the
sale auction or another Person designated by the Bankruptcy Court as the back-
up bidder, Purchaser shall either change its name to a name that does not
include the words "Palm Harbor Homes" or any confusingly similar words or
cause itself to be wound up and dissolved.

the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are resolved
against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation

completion or observance of a covenant, agreement, obligation or notice by

day other than a Business Day, then the date for such performance, delivery,
completion, observance or occurrence shall automatically be extended to the
next Business Day following such date.

provision or portion of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected
thereby. 

  

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof
each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties
hereto.
