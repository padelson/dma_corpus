ARTICLE I.

_The Merger _

SECTION 1.01. _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
and in accordance with Section 104H of the Bermuda Companies Act of 1981 (the
" _Bermuda Companies Act_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving company in
the Merger (such surviving company, the " _Surviving Company_ ").

SECTION 1.02. _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub will (a) on or prior to the Closing Date, execute and deliver the
Statutory Merger Agreement, (b) on or prior to the Closing Date, cause an
application for registration of the Surviving Company (the " _Merger
Application_ ") to be executed and delivered to the Registrar of the Companies
in Bermuda (the " _Registrar_ ") as provided under Section 108 of the Bermuda
Companies Act, and (c) cause to be included in the Merger Application a
request that the Registrar issue the certificate of merger with respect to the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date. The Merger
shall become effective upon the issuance of the Certificate of Merger by the
Registrar (such time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

SECTION 1.03. _Effects of Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 109(2)
of the Bermuda Companies Act.

SECTION 1.04. _Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws of the Surviving
Company_. At the Effective Time, the memorandum of association of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become
the memorandum of association of the Surviving Company and the bye-laws of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be in
the form of (except with respect to the name of the Company) the bye-laws of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and in such forms shall be
the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable
Law (in each case, subject to _Section 5.08_).

 

SECTION 1.05. _Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The
directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their

 



2  respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.
The officers of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 1.06. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Conyers Dill and Pearman Limited, Clarendon House,
2 Church Street, Hamilton, Bermuda at 10:00 a.m., Hamilton time, on the third
Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver of those conditions at such time), or at such other place, time and
date as shall be agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

ARTICLE II.

 

 _Effect on the Share Capital of the Constituent Entities; Payment of
Consideration_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect of Merger on the Share Capital of Merger Sub and the
Company_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Merger,
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
holder of any common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Shares_ ") or any common shares, par value $1.00 per share, of
Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Shares_ "):

(a) _Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding Merger
Sub Share shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable common share, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving
Company (the " _Surviving Company Shares_ ").

 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All Company
Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury shares and any Company
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to _Section 2.01(b)_ and _Section
2.02(i)_, each issued and outstanding Company Share shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $3.00, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). As of the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each registered holder of Company Shares (a " _Registered Shareholder_ ")
(whether holding a certificate representing Company Shares (a " _Certificate_
") or holding Company Shares that are not represented by certificates ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ")) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pertaining to the
Company Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the
case may be, the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)_, and the right to receive dividends and other distributions in
accordance with _Section 2.02(c)_, in each case without interest.

 



3 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange Fund_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company promptly to
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make all payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any former holder of Company Shares
to receive the Merger Consideration pertaining thereto as provided herein.

(b) _Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Certificates_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two Business
Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall instruct
the Paying Agent to mail to each Registered Shareholder a form of letter of
transmittal (which (i) may specify that payment of the Merger Consideration
shall only be effected upon delivery to the Paying Agent of (in the case of
certificated Company Shares) the Certificate and (ii) shall be in such form
and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving Company may
specify, subject to the Companys reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to
the Effective Time)), together with instructions thereto, setting forth, inter
alia, the procedures by which Registered Shareholders may receive the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. After
the Effective Time, each Registered Shareholder who holds Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent cash in an amount (subject
to _Section 2.02(h)_) equal to the number of Company Shares represented by
such Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration. Upon the
completion of such applicable procedures by a Registered Shareholder who
holds Certificates, such Registered Shareholder shall be entitled to receive
from the Paying Agent cash in an amount (subject to _Section 2.02(h)_) equal
to the number of Company Shares represented by such Certificates multiplied by
the Merger Consideration, and any such surrendered Certificates (in the case
of certificated Company Shares only) shall forthwith be canceled. If payment
of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name a Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Person requesting such payment (1) shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the Registered Shareholder or (2) shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on the cash payable pursuant to this  _Section 2.02(b)_.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of each Company Share upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until satisfaction of the applicable
procedures set

 



4  forth in this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company Shares formerly
represented thereby as contemplated by this Article II. From and after the
Effective Time, each Registered Shareholder shall cease to have any rights
with respect to their Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto and funds in respect of the amount of Merger
Consideration attributable to Company Shares that are Dissenting Shares) that
had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed
to Registered Shareholders, and thereafter such Registered Shareholders shall
be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent
and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claims of
the Merger Consideration pertaining to their former Company Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such Registered Shareholders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration
made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will
be returned to Parent, upon demand.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any
provision of other applicable Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



5 (i) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled (but shall not entitle
their holders to receive the Merger Consideration) and converted into the
right to receive the fair value thereof under Section 106 of the Bermuda
Companies Act (provided that if a Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect
effectively, withdraws or waives or loses such dissenters` rights action, such
Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration).
The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of (i) any demands for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares or attempted negotiations to settle or
attempted withdrawal or withdrawals of such demands received by the Company
and any other instruments served under the Bermuda Companies Act and received
by the Company relating to any Dissenting Shareholders right to be paid the
fair value of such Dissenting Shareholders Dissenting Shares and (ii) any
applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value
of the Dissenting Shares and (b) the right and opportunity to participate with
the Company in any and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
written demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands
or applications, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act.

SECTION 2.03. _Company Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any duly authorized committee
thereof administering the Company Share Plans) shall adopt such resolutions
and take such other actions as may be required to provide that, immediately
following the Effective Time, the Company Share Plans will terminate and,
subject to _Section 2.02(h)_:

 

(a) Without any action on the part of any holder or the Company, each
outstanding stock option granted under a Company Share Plan or otherwise (a "
_Company Option_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time and shall be exchanged for a
cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Shares subject
to the Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger
Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Share subject
to such Company Option; and

 

(b) Without any action on the part of any holder or the Company, each
outstanding restricted stock unit or restricted share unit granted under a
Company Share Plan or otherwise (a " _Company RSU_ "), whether or not then
vested, shall become fully vested and all restrictions with respect thereto
shall lapse immediately as of the Effective Time and shall be exchanged for
a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Company RSU and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) Without any action on the part of any holder or the Company, each
outstanding share of restricted stock of the Company granted or awarded under
the Company Share Plan or otherwise (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") whether
or not then vested, shall become fully vested and all restrictions with
respect thereto shall lapse immediately as of the Effective Time and shall
be exchanged for a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of
Company Restricted Shares and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 



6 (d) _Rights of Holders_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU
and Company Option shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto; _provided_ , that such holders shall
have the right to receive the applicable consideration to be paid in respect
of each such Company RSU and Company Option as contemplated by this _Article
II_.

SECTION 2.04. _Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards_.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event, no later than three
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company shall pay
through its payroll systems the amounts due pursuant to _Section 2.03_ to the
holders of Company Options and Company RSUs.

SECTION 2.05. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, which change shall not take place without the express prior
consent thereto in accordance with _Article V_ , the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or

Schedule_ ") (it being understood that any information set forth on one
Section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other Section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
information is relevant to such other Section or subsection) or (B) disclosed
in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC and publicly available prior to the Business Day
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed SEC Documents_
"), excluding any disclosures set forth in any section of a Filed SEC Document
entitled "risk factors" or "forward-looking statements" to the extent they
are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature:

company duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of Bermuda. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
necessary to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company
is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where
such concept or an equivalent thereto is recognized under applicable Law) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. A true and complete copy of the Company
Charter and the bye-laws of the Company are included in the Filed SEC
Documents.

 



7 (b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (where such concept or an equivalent thereto is recognized

orally or in writing, that the Company or such Subsidiary is commercially
domiciled in any jurisdiction.

 

SECTION 3.02. _Capitalization_. (a) At the close of business on December 31,

Company Shares were held by the Company as treasury shares and (iii) 955,804
Company Shares in the aggregate were reserved and available for issuance

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (1) issued any
Company Securities or incurred any obligation to make any payments based on
the price or value of any Company Securities or dividends paid thereon that
were outstanding as of the Capitalization Date or (2) established a record
date for, declared, set aside for payment or paid any dividend on, or made
any other distribution in respect of, any shares of the Companys capital
stock.

equity or voting interests in, the Company, (ii) no outstanding securities of
the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,

interests in, the Company, (iv) no obligations of the Company to grant, extend
or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable
security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company (the items in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being referred to collectively as " _Company
Securities_ ") and (v) no other obligations by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any Company
Securities or dividends paid thereon. There are no outstanding agreements of
any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities (or obligate the Company to
grant, extend or enter into any such agreements relating to any Company
Securities) or that grant any preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-
dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights with respect to any
Company Securities. Except as described in this _Section 3.02_, no direct or
indirect Subsidiary of the Company owns any Company Shares. Other than the
Registration Rights Agreement, none of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party to any shareholders agreement, voting trust agreement,

8  agreement or other similar agreement or understanding relating to any
Company Securities or any other agreement relating to the disposition, voting
or dividends with respect to any Company Securities. All outstanding Company
Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

 

(c) The Company Shares constitute the only issued and outstanding class of
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the " _Exchange Act_ ").

 

(d) There have been no re-pricings of any Company Options through amendments,

Transactions. None of the Company Options was granted with an exercise price
below the fair market value, as determined in accordance with the Company
Share Plan, on the date of grant. All grants of Company Options were validly
made and properly approved by the Companys Board of Directors (or a duly
authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in compliance with all
applicable Law, and no such grants of Company Options involved any "back
dating," "forward dating" or similar practices.

 

(e) _Section 3.02(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
the date of this Agreement, the name and jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary of the Company. Except as set forth in _Section 3.02_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of
the Company (except for directors qualifying shares) are owned directly or
indirectly, beneficially and of record, by the Company free and clear of all
Liens and material transfer restrictions, except for such Liens and
transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be created under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Act_ ") or other applicable
securities Laws. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of each

respect to any securities of any Subsidiary of the Company. None of the
Subsidiaries of the Company has any outstanding equity compensation or similar
plans relating to the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, any Subsidiary of the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to make any payments based on the price or
value of any securities of any Subsidiary of the Company or dividends paid
thereon.

amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to

 



11  state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, to the Companys Knowledge, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment letters received by the

processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow

 



12  timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. No
employee of the Company who has a significant role in the preparation of the
Companys financial statements or the internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries has, in

liabilities of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent

906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to such Company SEC Documents.

 

(g) The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and will not, at the time it is filed
with the SEC, at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company, at the time of any amendment thereof or supplement thereto and at the
time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliates
thereof specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting any fact

good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it

Schedule) no consent or approval of, action by or in respect of, or filing,
license, permit or authorization, declaration or registration with, any
Governmental Authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub
of their obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub
of the Transactions, other than such other consents, approvals, filings,
licenses, permits or authorizations, declarations or registrations that,

of the Transactions and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent and
Merger Sub.

SECTION 4.06. _Certain Arrangements_. Except for the Support Agreement, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no Contracts or other arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into

and any member of the Companys management or Board of Directors, on the other
hand, that relate in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Transactions or (b) pursuant to which any Registered Shareholder or holder of

pursuant to which any Registered Shareholder agrees to vote to approve
the Merger and this Agreement or agrees to vote against any Superior
Proposal.

SECTION 4.07. _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for Guggenheim Securities,
LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent or its Affiliates,

connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except for
Persons, if any, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Parent.

statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Company Shareholders Meeting which has become false or
misleading.

 

SECTION 4.09. _Legal Proceedings_. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there is no (a) pending or, to the

Merger Sub, investigation against Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or (b) injunction, order, judgment, ruling,

any solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be

VII_ , not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly

the Companys Board of Directors.

 



33 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 5.02(a)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal did not
result from any material breach of this  _Section 5.02_, then (i) the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons
making the Takeover Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and
(ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) enter
into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of
Persons making the Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant thereto information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover
Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall concurrently therewith (in the

of the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal, and the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed at all times of any and all
material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal (including
any material changes thereto and the status thereof). The Company agrees that
it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.02(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ will be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof

cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Board of Directors
of the Company may: (x) if the Company has received a Superior

 



34  Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(d)(ii)_ and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , that the Company has given Parent at
least three (3) Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ ") prior written notice
of its intention to take such action and (i) the Company has attached to such
notice the most current version of the proposed Company Acquisition Agreement
(and the Company shall promptly deliver to Parent any revised draft of such
Company Acquisition Agreement that is exchanged between the Company and the
Person making such Superior Proposal prior to the termination of this
Agreement that constitutes a material revision to the terms thereof), (ii) the
Company has caused its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to
make such adjustments (it being understood and agreed (I) that in the event
that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision
to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the
Notice Period will be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two
(2) Business Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the
Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood
that any material revision or amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal
will require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 5.02(d)_ that is subject
to such two-Business Day Notice Period), and (II) that there may be multiple
extensions of the Notice Period), and (iii) the Board of Directors has
considered any adjustments to this Agreement (including a change to the price
terms hereof) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be offered
in writing by Parent (collectively, the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later
than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the final Business Day of such three
(3)-Business Day or two (2)-Business Day period, as applicable, and has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and outside financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given
effect; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that any purported termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 5.02(d)_ will be void and of no
force and effect unless such termination by the Company is in accordance with
_Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ and, as a condition precedent to such termination, the
Company has paid Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.03(a)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination; and (y)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors has determined
in good faith after consultation with its financial advisers and outside
legal counsel that, as a result of a development, occurrence, event, state of
facts or change (other than a Takeover Proposal) with respect to the Company
that was not known to the Board of Directors as of or prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ "), the failure to
take such action (after taking into account any Proposed Changed Terms
proposed by Parent in response to such Intervening Event as contemplated by
clause (B) below) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that (A) any improvement in the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company to the extent arising out
of or resulting from any Related Transaction or the announcement thereof
shall not be deemed an Intervening Event hereunder and (B) prior to making an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall give Parent at least three
Business Days (also, a " _Notice Period_ ") prior written notice of the
intention of the Board of Directors to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
and, in determining whether the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
the Board of Directors shall take into account any Proposed Changed Terms
proposed by Parent in response to such Intervening Event no later than 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the final Business Day of such Notice Period.

 



35 (e) Nothing in this _Section 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof from taking and disclosing to Registered Shareholders a
position or communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
that any such position or disclosure (other than a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, in each case that includes a reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation, a factually accurate public statement describing the Companys
receipt of a Takeover Proposal or a statement to the effect that a Takeover
Proposal is under consideration by the Board of Directors of the Company)
will be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of
Directors of the Company expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation.

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "
means (x) any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and
after the date of this Agreement that contains provisions that are no less

a standstill provision, or (y) any confidentiality agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any bona fide
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer, in each case in written

consolidated revenue, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of
Company Securities, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,

Company or any one or more Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the

net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or of the surviving
entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect
parent of the Company or such surviving entity, in each case, other than the
Transactions.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all relevant (in
the view of the Board of Directors of the Company) legal,
regulatory, financial and other aspects of such proposal, including any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, certainty of completion and
conditions to consummation, as well as any Proposed Changed Terms proposed by
Parent in response to such Takeover Proposal, are more favorable to the
Registered Shareholders than the Merger (after giving effect to the

 



36  Proposed Changed Terms, if any); _provided_ , that for purposes of the
definition of " _Superior Proposal_ ", the references to " _15%_ " in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to " _50%_
".

SECTION 5.03. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_. (a)
Subject to _Section 5.03(b)_, the Company shall take all necessary actions in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Companys bye-laws
and the rules of the NASDAQ to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of Registered Shareholders (including any adjournment, recess,
reconvening or postponement thereof, the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments
on the Proxy Statement. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall not submit any Takeover Proposal
for approval by the Registered Holders, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to _Section
7.01(c)(iv)_, the Company may, in its sole discretion, adjourn, recess,
reconvene or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) after consultation
with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Registered Shareholders
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, (ii) to obtain a quorum of Registered Holders to take action at the
Company Shareholders Meeting or (iii) to solicit from the holders of the
Company Shares proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions if the Company determines, in good faith, that the Company
Shareholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the Company Shareholders
Meeting.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent as set
forth herein) shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the SEC. The
Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
finalized with the SEC such that it can be disseminated to its shareholders
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Subject to _Section
5.02_, the Board of Directors of the Company shall make the Company Board
Recommendation to the Registered Shareholders and shall include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide to the
Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as is required to be
included in the Proxy Statement or that is reasonably requested by the Company
in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and
cooperate with the Company in the resolution of any comments thereto received
from the SEC. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their
respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement or any other
filing required under applicable Law, as applicable, would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the applicable filing
required under applicable Law describing such information will be promptly
prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law
or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Registered Holders. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly upon 

 



37  the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with
copies of all written correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments received from the SEC concerning the Proxy
Statement and to resolve such comments with the SEC, and shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to its shareholders promptly after the resolution
of any such comments; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor
any of its Affiliates, if applicable, will file the Proxy Statement, deliver
the Proxy Statement to its shareholders, or correspond or otherwise
communicate with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement in
any such case without having provided Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon or participate therein, as the case
may be, and the Company agrees that it shall consider the comments of Parent
and Merger Sub with respect thereto in good faith.

SECTION 5.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with
the other parties and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any
action, another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein) to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to
be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the
Transactions and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Related
Transactions, including (A) taking all such actions contemplated by the terms
of the Statutory Merger Agreement, (B) otherwise preparing and filing promptly
and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents and (C) executing and delivering any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and, in the
case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Related Transactions, (ii) obtain all
approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders
and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions and, in the
case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Related Transactions, including any such
approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders
and other confirmations required with respect to the Company Insurance
Approvals, the Parent Insurance Approvals and under applicable Antitrust
Laws, (iii) take all steps that are necessary, proper or advisable to avoid
any Actions by any Governmental Authorities with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions or, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Related
Transactions, and (iv) defend or contest in good faith any Action by any third
party (including any Governmental Authority), whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or that could otherwise prevent or
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the
consummation of the Transactions or, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the
Related Transactions, including by seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated to agree to any
arrangement that would:

 



     | A. |

require or involve (x) the sale, disposition, or separate holding, through the
establishment of a trust, or otherwise, of any material portion of the
Company 

---|---|--- 
 



38 properties acquired pursuant to this Agreement, or material portion of any of
the assets, properties or business of Parent, AmTrust or NGHC or any of their
respective Affiliates, or (y) the making of any material (1) debt, equity
investment or capital contribution to, (2) capital or reserve maintenance
commitment or "keepwell" to or (3) guaranty of obligations of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent, AmTrust or NGHC or any of their respective
Affiliates; 
---|--- 



     | B. | require or involve any material modification of the existing
capital structure of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent, AmTrust
or NGHC or any of their respective Affiliates; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | C. | involve any material requirement or restriction on the
business of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent, AmTrust or NGHC
or any of their respective Affiliates; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | D. | restrict, in connection with the consummation of the Related
Transactions, any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries from being able to
effectuate a Permitted Transfer of Value (and " _Permitted Transfer of Value_
" is defined herein as a transfer of assets from a Company Insurance
Subsidiary to an Affiliate (whether referred to as a dividend, a reserve
transfer or other event) that, when taken together with other such transfers
in connection with the Related Transactions, would not result in the failure
of any Company Insurance Subsidiary to have sufficient capital to support its
business plan as presented to the applicable Insurance Regulator); or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | E. | otherwise be reasonably likely to materially adversely impact
the economic, tax or business benefits to any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent, AmTrust or NGHC, of the
Transactions and the Related Transactions, taken as a whole. 
---|---|--- 

(each of the circumstances in (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) being a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of each of (A),
(B), (C) and (E), "material" (including "materially" and any other forms of
such term) shall mean an amount greater than $15 million in the aggregate for
all instances of events described therein for all of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Parent, AmTrust, NGHC and their respective Affiliates in the
aggregate; _provided_ that no arrangement, condition or restriction that is
customarily imposed in transactions of the type contemplated by this
Agreement or any Contract that relates to the Related Transactions will be
deemed a Burdensome Condition hereunder.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Related
Transactions, and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions or any of the Related
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions and,
in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Related Transactions, may

 



39  be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and the Contracts related to the Related Transactions, as
applicable, and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such Takeover Law
on the Transactions and the Related Transactions.

(c) Without limiting the general applicability of  _Section 5.04(a)_, each
of the Company and Parent shall, in consultation and cooperation with the
other and as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
file (i) with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice the notification and
report form, if any, required under the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) all appropriate documents, forms, filings or submissions
required under any non-U.S. Antitrust Laws and (iii) with applicable
Insurance Regulators, all documents, forms, filings or other submissions
required under applicable Insurance Laws with respect to the Transactions or,
in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the Related Transactions. Any such
filings shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of applicable
Law. Each of the parties shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
_Section 5.04(a)_, (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with
its preparation of any documents, forms, filings or submissions contemplated
by the first sentence of this  _Section 5.04(c)_, (ii) give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, of any substantive communication with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental
Authority regarding the Transactions or the Related Transactions, and permit
the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of, and secure, to the extent reasonably
practicable, the participation of, the other party in connection with, any
such filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (iii)
furnish the other party with copies of all filings, submissions,
correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of any Governmental
Authoritys staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the
Transactions or any Related Transaction and (iv) comply with any inquiry or
request from any Governmental Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable,
other than in respect of a Burdensome Condition.

SECTION 5.05. _Transfer Taxes_. All share transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving
Company, and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in preparing, executing and filing any applicable Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

SECTION 5.06. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and joint approval of Parent and
the Company, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or the
rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system (in which case Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall have the right to review such press release or other public
statement prior to its issuance,

 



40  distribution or publication) and except for matters permitted to be
disclosed pursuant to _Section 5.02_. The parties hereto agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions following
execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the
parties hereto.

 

SECTION 5.07. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Subject to
applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company (i) shall afford to
Parent and Parents Representatives (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
AmTrust, NGHC and their respective Representatives) reasonable access during
normal business hours to the Companys officers, employees, agents,
properties, books, Contracts and records (including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, access to the foregoing and work papers of the
Companys auditors and access to the Companys auditors, in each case as may
be necessary for Parent or any of its Affiliates to begin the preparation,
review and audit by Parent, its Affiliates or their respective auditors of
financial statements with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective assets, liabilities and results of operations in order to allow
Parent and such Affiliates to comply with their reporting obligations after
the Closing Date under applicable Law), (ii) shall provide Parent and Parents
Representatives (including, for the avoidance of doubt, AmTrust, NGHC and
their respective Representatives) reasonable cooperation with respect to the
foregoing and the consummation of the Related Business Acquisitions, and (iii)
shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parents Representatives such
information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and
properties as Parent or any of Parents Representatives may reasonably
request; _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any
such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if doing
so could violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party, or waive the protection of an
attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege (as long as the Company has
used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any third party
required thereunder). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the
Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk
waiver of such privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section 5.07_ shall be directed to the Person designated by the Company.
Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the
terms of the letter agreement dated as of November 5, 2013, by and among the
Company and AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (as may in the future be amended
from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.07(a)_, the Company will furnish to Parent,
for the interim period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
internally prepared, unaudited financial statements for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for each monthly period completed prior to 31 days before the
Closing Date.

 

SECTION 5.08. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, out of the
assets of the Surviving Company (subject to Section _5.08(d)_ below),
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of 

 



41  the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including reasonable
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based
on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was
a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at
any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole
or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnitee), to the fullest extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries would
be permitted or required to indemnify the Indemnitees under the Company
Charter and bye-laws of the Company, and the organizational documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnity contract filed with the SEC prior
to the Business Day immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall
cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the memorandum of association and
bye-laws of the Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the Business Day
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter and
bye-laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, out of the assets of the Surviving
Company (subject to Section _5.08(d)_ below), advance any expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this
_Section 5.08_ (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations referred to in this _Section 5.08_) as incurred to the
fullest extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries would be permitted or
required to indemnify the Indemnitees under the Company Charter and the
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnity
contract filed with the SEC prior to the Business Day immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the individual to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be
determined that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to not settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
_Section 5.08_ for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such litigation claim or proceeding or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent.

 

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals
who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the 

 



42  Effective Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage,
and in amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute
therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage
with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including a "tail" policy); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the aggregate
premium for such "tail" policy shall exceed 300% of the annual premium paid by
the Company in its last completed fiscal year (such 300% threshold, the "
_Maximum Premium_ "), then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a
policy for the applicable individuals with the greatest coverage as shall then
be available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. The Company may
prior to the Effective Time purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed
the aggregate Maximum Premium for six years, a six-year prepaid "tail policy"
on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits
as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained
by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Company to obtain insurance pursuant to this  _Section
5.08(c)_ and the Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

 

(d) During the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall not, and Parent shall not permit the
Surviving Company to, pay any dividend, distribution or other amount to
holders of its capital stock, repurchase or redeem any shares of its capital
stock, or sell, transfer or dispose of any asset to an Affiliate at less than
its fair value if the consolidated tangible net asset value of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, calculated in accordance with GAAP, would be
less than $70,000,000 following the payment of such dividend, distribution or
other amount, the redemption or repurchase of such shares or the consummation
of such sale, transfer or disposition.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.08_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Charter, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this _Section 5.08_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.08_ applies unless (x)
such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 5.08_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.08_).

 

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth
in this _Section 5.08_.

 



43 (g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.08_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

SECTION 5.09. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 5.10. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of one year following the
Effective Time or, if longer, the time required by applicable Law, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company, AmTrust or NGHC, as
applicable (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the
assets and business of the Surviving Company, AmTrust or NGHC, as applicable,
its successors and assigns), to provide, each individual who is employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a " _Company Employee_ "), for so long as such Company Employee is an
employee of the Surviving Company, AmTrust or NGHC, as applicable, after the
Effective Time, with (i) a base salary or wage rate at least equal to the
Company Employees base salary or wage rate in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (other than any incentive
compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and
retiree medical benefits) that are, in the aggregate, not, in any material
respect, less favorable than the employee benefits (other than any incentive
compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and
retiree medical benefits) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent,
AmTrust, NGHC or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, no provision of this Agreement shall guarantee employment
to any Company Employee for any period of time or preclude Parent,
the Surviving Company, AmTrust or NGHC from terminating any such Company
Employee for any reason.

(b) With respect to each Company Employee who (i) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, is a participant in, covered by, or eligible for benefits
under, a Company Plan that provides for severance benefits (a " _Company
Severance Pay Plan_ ") and (ii) whose employment with the Surviving Company,
Company Subsidiaries and its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated in a
severance-qualifying manner during the one (1) year period following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, such Company Employee with severance benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the severance benefits, if any, that would
have been provided pursuant to the terms of the severance plan of the
Company to such employees upon an involuntary severance-qualifying
termination of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided
that no such severance benefits shall be provided to any Company Employee who
is a party to a Company Employment Agreement that otherwise provides for
severance benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that a
transfer of employment between the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent,
AmTrust, NGHC and/or any Affiliate of the foregoing shall not entitle an
individual to severance hereunder or under any Company Severance Plan, and,
effective prior to the Closing, the Company shall amend each Company Severance
Plan to provide that there shall be no such entitlement.

 



44 (c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies,
each Company Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was
recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer
of all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company,
its successors and assigns); _provided_ , however, that such service need not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control", the occurrence of
the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change
of control."

(e) (i) The Company shall cause each participant to be fully vested in his or
her benefits under (A) the Tower Group, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, (B)
the Tower Group International, Ltd. Short Term Performance Incentive Plan, and
(C) any other Company Plan providing for deferred compensation within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code (collectively, the " _Terminating Plans_
") and (ii) the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law, terminate
each of the Terminating Plans effective immediately prior to, but conditioned
on the occurrence of, the Effective Time.

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.10_ is
intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise,
provide any Person with a right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period and, except as otherwise explicitly provided for in this
Agreement, no current or former employee or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of

is unavailable over a particular matter, the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack
of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The
consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section 8.07(b)_ shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of New York
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties
hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in
_Section 8.10_ of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , that nothing in the foregoing
shall restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding,
or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

 

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right of the
Company or Parent to cause the Merger to be consummated on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the courts
described in _Section 8.07(b)_ without proof of damages or otherwise, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 8.08_ shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.
