SECTION 1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the  Transferred Equity Interests_. On the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller
and Intermediate Holdco shall sell, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall purchase and accept  from Seller and Intermediate Holdco, the

  2

 

   


 

 


 

 

permitted by applicable Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefit
thereof (except in any such case for any such  conditions that by their
nature can be satisfied only on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver by the party entitled to waive such conditions) ( _provided_ that if

Marketing Period specified by Purchaser to Seller on no less than two Business
Days' prior written notice to Seller and (ii) the last Business Day of the

(Conditions Precedent) at such time (except in any such case for any  such
conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only on the Closing Date, but
subject to the satisfaction of such conditions or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver by the party entitled to waive such conditions) (
_provided_ that if (x) the final day of the Marketing Period occurs during the
calendar month in which the Outside Date would occur (or during the pendency
of such  Marketing Period Purchaser specifies to Seller it desires the
Closing to occur notwithstanding the fact the Marketing Period has not been
completed) and (y) the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (Conditions
Precedent) have been so satisfied or waived by the date referred to in clause

Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall prepare in
good faith and deliver to Purchaser (x) a statement (the " _Estimated
Closing  Statement_ "), in form and substance consistent with the
illustrative example set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto (provided that in the
event of any  inconsistency between the illustrative example and the
Accounting Principles or this Agreement, the Accounting Principles and this
Agreement shall control), setting forth (i) Seller's good faith estimate of
Closing Cash (" _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Seller's good faith estimate of
Closing Working Capital (" _Estimated Working  Capital_ "), (iii) Seller's
good faith estimate of Closing Indebtedness (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ "),
(iv) Seller's good faith estimate of the Closing  Required Payment Amount
(the " _Estimated Required Payment Amount_ "), (v) Seller's good faith
estimate of all Change of Control Payments (the " _Estimated Change of Control

_Estimated Retiree Medical Liability Amount_ ").        The Estimated
Closing Statement and the Estimated Unfunded Employee Liability Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles (to the extent
applicable) and this Agreement and shall include a reasonably detailed
summary  of the calculations made to arrive at, and reasonable supporting
documentation for, such amounts. Seller has previously provided or made
available to Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement (x) an illustrative
calculation of the Estimated  Unfunded Defined Benefit Plan Liability Amount
as of December 31, 2018 consistent with the Pension Principles and (y) an
illustrative calculation of the Estimated Retiree Medical Liability Amount as
of December 31, 2018 consistent with the  Retiree Medical Principles. In the
event of any conflict between such illustrative calculations and the Pension
Principles or Retiree Medical Principles, as applicable, the Pension
Principles or Retiree Medical Principles, as applicable, shall  control.

 


 

 

(b) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare in
good  faith and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth (i) Cash as of the Reference Time (but giving effect to any
subsequent cash  dividends or distributions to Seller or Intermediate Holdco,
or use of Cash to pay down Indebtedness

 


 

  
 

  4

 

 

 


  
 

or pay expenses in connection with the Transactions, in each case, prior to
the Closing) (" _Closing Cash_ "), (ii) Working Capital as of the Reference
Time (" _Closing Working  Capital_ "), (iii) Indebtedness as of immediately
prior to Closing (" _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iv) the Required Payment
Amount as of immediately  prior to Closing (the " _Closing Required Payment
Amount_ "), (v) the Change of Control Payments (the " _Closing Change of
Control Payments_ ") and (vi) the Final Closing Date Amount. Within 180

Statement_ ") setting forth (x) the Unfunded Defined Benefit Plan Liability
Amount (the " _Closing Unfunded Defined Benefit Plan Liability Amount_ ") and
(y) the Transferred Retiree Medical Liabilities (the " _Closing Retiree
Medical Liability Amount_ "). The Closing Statement and the Closing Unfunded
Employee Liability Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles (to the extent applicable) and  this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Each of the Closing Statement and the Closing Unfunded Employee Liability
Statement shall  become final and binding upon the parties on the 45th
calendar day following delivery thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of
its disagreement with the Closing Statement or Purchaser gives written notice
of its disagreement with the  Closing Unfunded Employee Liability Statement,
as applicable, based on mathematical errors or based on Closing Cash, Closing
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Required Payment Amount,
the Closing Change of Control Payments, the  Closing Unfunded Defined Benefit
Plan Liability Amount or the Closing Retiree Medical Liability Amount, as
applicable, not being calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles
(to the extent applicable) and this Agreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ")
to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, on or prior to such date (or on such
earlier date on which the applicable party may deliver to the other  party
written notice that it has no disagreements with the Closing Statement or the
Closing Unfunded Employee Liability Statement, as applicable). Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement
so  asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable, within the 45 calendar day period referred to above,
then the Closing Statement or the Closing Unfunded Employee Liability
Statement (in each case, as  revised in accordance with this sentence), as
applicable, shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of
(i) the date on which Purchaser and Seller resolve in writing all differences
they have with respect to the matters  specified in such Notice of
Disagreement that were not resolved by Purchaser and Seller and (ii) the date
on which all disputed matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement are
finally resolved in writing by the Independent Expert pursuant  to the
procedures set forth in this _Section 1.04_. During the 45 calendar day period
following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser and Seller
shall  seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may
have with respect to the matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement.
Promptly after the end of such 45 calendar day period, Purchaser and Seller
shall submit to the  Independent Expert for review any and all matters that
remain in dispute and were included in a Notice of Disagreement. The parties
shall instruct the Independent Expert to render its decision as to the
disputed items and the effect of its  decision on the Closing Statement or
the Closing Unfunded Employee Liability Statement, as applicable, as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than 45 calendar days after its
selection. Each party shall furnish to the Independent  Expert such working

 


 

 


 

  5

 

 


 

 


 

 

papers and other relevant documents and information relating to the disputed
items, and shall provide  interviews and answer questions, as the Independent
Expert may reasonably request in connection with its determination of such
disputed items; _provided_ that  any such working papers or other relevant
documents and information shall also be provided to the other party. In the
event any party shall participate in teleconferences or meetings with, or make
presentations to, the Independent Expert, the  other party shall be entitled
to participate in such teleconferences, meetings or presentations. The terms
of appointment and engagement of the Independent Expert shall be as agreed
upon between the parties in writing.

 


 

 

(d) In resolving any such disputed item, the Independent Expert (i) shall act
in the capacity of  an expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) shall limit its
review to matters specifically set forth in a Notice of Disagreement as a
disputed item (other than matters thereafter resolved by mutual written
agreement of the parties), (iii) shall  not assign a value to any disputed
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party, in each
case, (x) in respect of Purchaser, in the Closing  Statement and (y) in
respect of Seller, in the Estimated Closing Statement, the Estimated Unfunded
Employee Liability Statement and the Closing Unfunded Employee Liability
Statement, (iv) shall not permit or authorize ex parte communications, 
presentations, discovery or testimony and (v) shall base its decision solely
on the provisions of this Agreement (including, as applicable, the Accounting
Principles) and the written submissions by Purchaser and Seller and their
respective  representatives and not by independent review. The Independent
Expert is not authorized to, and shall not, make any other determination,
including (A) any determination with respect to any matter included in the
Closing Statement, the Closing  Unfunded Employee Liability Statement or a
Notice of Disagreement that was not submitted for resolution to the
Independent Expert, (B) any determination as to whether the Accounting
Principles were followed with respect to the Financial  Statements, (C) any
determination as to whether the Target Working Capital was properly calculated
in accordance with the Accounting Principles, (D) any determination as to the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.05_
(Financial Statements) or any other representation or warranty in  this
Agreement, (E) any determination as to compliance by any party with any of
their respective covenants in this Agreement or (F) any determination that an
issue was not properly included by Seller or Purchaser in a Notice of
Disagreement.   Any dispute not within the scope of disputes to be resolved
by the Independent Expert pursuant to this _Section 1.04_ shall be resolved as
otherwise provided in this  Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 1.04_ is not intended to adjust the Initial Closing Date Amount or
the Final Closing Date Amount for errors or  omissions, under GAAP or
otherwise, that may be found with respect to the Financial Statements or
Target Working Capital. Any determination by the Independent Expert, and any
work or analyses performed by the Independent Expert, may not be  offered as
evidence in any Proceeding as evidence of a breach of _Section 3.05_
(Financial       Statements), a breach of any other representation or
warranty in this Agreement or a breach of any covenant in this Agreement
(other than a breach of this _Section 1.04_).

 


 

 

(e) The final determination by the Independent Expert of the matters submitted
to it pursuant to  _Section 1.04(c)_ shall (i) be in writing, (ii) include
the Independent Expert's

 


 

 

 


 

  6

 

 

 


 

 


 

 

 

calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount or the Final Unfunded Employee
Liability Amount, as applicable, (iii) include the Independent  Expert's
determination of each matter submitted to it pursuant to _Section 1.04(c)_ and
(iv) include a brief summary of the Independent Expert's reasons for  its
determination of each issue.

 


 

 

(f) Absent fraud or manifest error by the Independent Expert, the resolution
of disputed items by  the Independent Expert shall be final and binding, and
the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an arbitral award
that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court having  jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Expert incurred pursuant to this _Section 1.04_  with respect to a Notice of
Disagreement shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller based on the inverse of
the percentage that the Independent Expert's resolution of the disputed items
covered by such Notice of Disagreement (before such  allocation) bears to the
total amount of such disputed items as originally submitted to the Independent
Expert (for example, if the total amount of such disputed items as originally
submitted to the Independent Expert equals $1,000 and the  Independent Expert
awards $600 in favor of Seller's position, sixty percent (60%) of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Expert would be borne by Purchaser and forty
percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Independent Expert would be 
borne by Seller).

 


 

 

(g) Within five Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and
binding in accordance  with this _Section 1.04_ (the " _Final Closing
Statement_ ") upon the parties:

 


 

 

(i) if the Final Closing Date Amount is less than the Initial Closing Date
Amount (such amount,  the " _Shortfall_ "), Purchaser and Seller shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to deliver to Purchaser an amount  equal to the Shortfall; _provided_
that (A) to the extent the Shortfall is less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds
(the amount by which the Shortfall is less than the  Adjustment Escrow Funds
is referred to as the " _Adjustment Escrow Excess Amount_ "), such joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent shall include instructions to 
release to Seller from the Adjustment Escrow Account the Adjustment Escrow
Excess Amount, and (B) to the extent the Shortfall is greater than the
Adjustment Escrow Funds (the amount by which the Adjustment Escrow Funds is
less than the  Shortfall is referred to as the " _Adjustment Escrow Shortfall
Amount_ "), Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Adjustment Escrow Shortfall
Amount by wire transfer of  immediately available funds to the bank account
designated in writing by Purchaser at least two Business Days prior to the
date such payment is required to be made; or

 


 

 

(ii) if the Final Closing Date Amount is greater than the Initial Closing Date
Amount,  (A) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated in
writing by Seller at least two Business Days prior to the date such payment is
required to be made  and (B) Purchaser and Seller shall deliver joint written

 


 

 

 

  7

 

 


   


 

 

instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to
Seller from the Adjustment  Escrow Account the Adjustment Escrow Funds,

 


 

 

in each case, together with interest thereon, from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of  payment, at the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 


 

 

(h) Within five Business Days after the Closing Unfunded Employee Liability
Statement becomes  final and binding in accordance with this _Section 1.04_
(the " _Final Closing Unfunded Employee  Liability Statement_ ") upon the
parties:

 


 

 

 

 

 

(i) if the Final Unfunded Employee Liability Amount is greater than the
Initial Unfunded Employee Liability  Amount (such amount, the " _Employee
Liability Shortfall_ "), Purchaser and Seller shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to  deliver to
Purchaser an amount equal to the Employee Liability Shortfall; _provided_ that
(A) to the extent the Employee Liability Shortfall is less than the Employee 
Liability Adjustment Escrow Funds (the amount by which the Employee Liability
Shortfall is less than the Employee Liability Adjustment Escrow Funds is
referred to as the " _Employee  Liability Adjustment Escrow Excess Amount_
"), such joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent shall include
instructions to release to Seller from the Employee Liability Adjustment
Escrow Account the Employee Liability Adjustment  Escrow Excess Amount, and
(B) to the extent the Employee Liability Shortfall is greater than the
Employee Liability Adjustment Escrow Funds (the amount by which the Employee
Liability Adjustment Escrow Funds is less than the Employee Liability 
Shortfall is referred to as the " _Employee Liability Adjustment Escrow
Shortfall Amount_ "), Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Adjustment Escrow
Shortfall Amount by wire  transfer of immediately available funds to the bank
account designated in writing by Purchaser at least two Business Days prior to
the date such payment is required to be made; or

 


 

 

(ii) if the Closing Unfunded Employee Liability Amount is less than the
Estimated Unfunded Employee  Liability Amount, (A) Purchaser shall pay to
Seller the amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the bank account designated in writing by Seller at least two
Business Days prior to the date such payment is  required to be made and (B)
Purchaser and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Seller from the Employee
Liability Adjustment Escrow Account the Employee Liability  Adjustment Escrow
Funds,

 


 

 

in each case, together with interest thereon, from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of  payment, at the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 


 

 

(i) During the period from the Closing until such time as the Closing
Statement and the Closing  Unfunded Employee Liability Statement shall become
final and binding upon the parties in accordance with this _Section 1.04_,
each of the parties shall afford, and

 


 

  
 

  8

 

 


   


 

 

shall cause its Affiliates to afford, to the other party and any accountants,
counsel or financial advisers  retained in connection with any adjustment to
the Purchase Price contemplated by this _Section 1.04_ reasonable access
during normal business hours and under  reasonable circumstances, at the sole
cost and expense of such other party, to all the properties, books, Contracts,
personnel and records of the Companies, the work papers (subject to the
execution of customary access letters) of Purchaser and  the Companies and
the work papers of Seller (subject to the execution of customary access
letters) relevant to the adjustments contemplated by this _Section 1.04_, 
and shall provide, upon a party's reasonable request, copies of any such
books, Contracts, records and work papers.

 


 

 

(j) Any payment made under this _Section 1.04_  shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.05 _Escrow_. At the  Closing, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to
be delivered, on behalf of Seller, payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated in writing by the Escrow Agent an
amount equal to (a) the Adjustment Escrow  Amount, (b) the Employee Liability
Adjustment Escrow Amount, (c) the Indemnity Escrow Amount, each of (a), (b)
and (c) to be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "), by and among Purchaser, Seller and the Escrow Agent and (d) 
the Escrow Agent Fee. The Adjustment Escrow Funds, the Employee Liability
Escrow Funds and the Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be held, invested and
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.06 _Withholding_.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Purchaser or its  Affiliates are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. Any
decision by Purchaser or its Affiliates to deduct or withhold  from any
payment pursuant to this Agreement shall only be made after prior consultation
with Seller, which shall include providing Seller with a written notice
describing the amount and basis for such deduction or withholding at least 10
calendar  days prior to the applicable payment date (as reasonably estimated
by the parties), or as soon as reasonably practical thereafter (but in any
case prior to such payment date), and providing Seller with reasonable
opportunity to produce any forms,  certificates or other documentation that
may eliminate or reduce the amount of such deduction or withholding, it being
understood that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with
Seller in securing any available reduction or  exemption from such
withholding Tax. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to a
relevant Taxing Authority by Purchaser or its Affiliates, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been 
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made.

ARTICLE II

 


 

 

_Representations and Warranties Relating to Seller, Intermediate  Holdco and
the Transferred Equity Interests_

 


 

 

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Letter (it being understood that
each item set forth in any section of  the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to apply to the representation and warranty of Seller and Intermediate
Holdco contained in this _Article II_ and _Article III_ (Representations and
Warranties Relating to the Companies) to which  such section corresponds in
number and to each other section of the Seller Disclosure Letter and each
other representation and warranty of Seller contained in this _Article II_ 
and _Article III_ (Representations and Warranties Relating to the Companies)
to  which its relevance is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure), Seller and Intermediate Holdco, as applicable, hereby represent
and warrant to Purchaser, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date, as follows:

 


 

 

SECTION 2.01 _Organization and Standing; Power_.        Each of Seller,
Intermediate Holdco and each other Affiliate of Seller that will be a party to
a Transaction Agreement (each such Affiliate, together with Intermediate
Holdco, the " _Selling       Affiliates_ ") is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (to the extent the concept is recognized by the
applicable jurisdiction) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized. Seller has full corporate  or other organizational power and
authority to enable it to execute this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions. Each of Seller and Intermediate Holdco has full corporate or
other organizational power and authority to enable it to (a) own  the
applicable Transferred Equity Interests and (b) own, lease or otherwise hold
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently owned or
conducted, except, in the case of clause (b), where the failure to have such
power or  authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay,
the consummation of the Transactions by Seller or any Selling Affiliate (a "
_Seller Material Adverse Effect_ "). Each of Seller and each Selling Affiliate
has, or will have at the Closing, as applicable, full corporate or other
organizational power and authority to  execute each other Transaction
Agreement to which it is or will be party and to consummate the Transactions.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery;  Enforceability_. The
execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation by
Seller of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary

SECTION 2.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_.        (a) The execution,
delivery and performance by each of Seller and each Selling Affiliate of each
Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be party, the consummation of the
Transactions and the compliance by each of Seller and each Selling  Affiliate
with the terms thereof will not conflict with, or result in any violation of
or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of
any  obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
creation of any Lien (other than any Permitted Liens) upon any of the
properties or assets of Seller or any Selling Affiliate (including any assets
held under a lease or license)  under, (i) the organizational documents of
Seller or any Selling Affiliate or (ii) (A) any contract, lease, sublease,
license, indenture, debenture, note, bond, indenture, mortgage, guarantee,

in the aggregate, would  not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect.

Purchaser set forth in  _Article IV_ (Representations and Warranties of
Purchaser), no consent, approval,  license, permit, order, waiting period

declaration, notice or filing with, any federal, state,  local or foreign
government or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental or quasi-governmental entity or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required
to be obtained or made by or with respect to Seller or any Selling Affiliate
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
or any of the other  Transaction Agreements or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (i) the Required Regulatory Approvals, (ii) those
that may be required solely by reason of Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates'
(as opposed to any other third Person's)  participation in the Transactions
and (iii) those the failure of which to obtain or make, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Companies or
the Business, taken as a whole, or prevent or  materially impede, interfere

SECTION 2.04 _The Transferred Equity Interests_.        Seller or

  11

 

 

 


 

 


 

 

of all Liens (other than those arising under applicable securities Laws) and
is the sole record and beneficial owner of each  of the Transferred Equity
Interests. Assuming Purchaser has the requisite corporate or other
organizational power and authority to be the lawful owner of the Transferred
Equity Interests, upon completion of the actions described in  Section
1.03(b) (Transactions to be Effected at the Closing) and Seller's receipt from
Purchaser of an aggregate amount equal to the Initial  Closing Date Amount
minus the Initial Unfunded Employee Liability Amount, good and valid title of
the Transferred Equity Interests shall pass to Purchaser and Purchaser shall
be the record and beneficial owner of the Transferred Equity Interests,  free
and clear of all Liens, other than those arising from acts of Purchaser or its
Affiliates at the Closing and those arising under applicable securities Laws.
The Transferred Equity Interests are not subject to any voting trust
agreement,  proxy, shareholder agreement, commitment, undertaking,
understanding or other Contract restricting the voting, dividend rights,
transfer or disposition of such Transferred Equity Interests, or any option,
warrant, right, call, pledge, put or  other Contract providing for the
disposition, acquisition or transfer of such Transferred Equity Interests
(including rights of first refusal, rights of first negotiation, rights of
first offer or similar rights).

 


 

 

SECTION 2.05 _Brokers or Finders_. No  agent, broker, investment banker or
other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any broker's, finder's,

Agreement or the Transactions based upon arrangements made  by or on behalf
of Seller or any of its Affiliates, except Evercore Inc., whose fees and
expenses will be paid by or on behalf of Seller (which fees and expenses, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be Excluded Liabilities) and, upon payment of 
such fees and expenses, no Company shall have any continuing obligations to
Evercore Inc.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.06 _Opinion of Duff and Phelps, LLC_.        The boards of
directors of Seller and Intermediate Holdco have received, and authorized
entry into this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements after
receiving, reviewing, analyzing and approving, the opinion of Duff and Phelps,
LLC (the  " _Opinion_ ") to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion
and based upon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions,
limitations and other matters set  forth therein, the consideration
contemplated hereby to be received for the Transactions (i) is fair, from a
financial point of view, to Seller and Intermediate Holdco and (ii)
constitutes at least reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the  assets
to be sold pursuant to this Agreement. Seller has furnished to Purchaser a
true and complete copy of such opinion. The boards of directors of Seller and
Intermediate Holdco determined, after consultation with their outside legal
and  financial advisors and review of the Opinion, that the Transactions were
negotiated at arm's length and in good faith.

properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted.
Each Company is duly qualified and licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the  conduct or nature of its business or the ownership
or lease of its properties or assets makes such qualification necessary,

are  no options, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities,
"phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
which any Company is party  or by which any Company is bound (A) obligating
any Company to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests in any
Company, or any security convertible or  exercisable for or exchangeable into
any membership interest of, or other Equity Interest in, any Company or any
Voting Company Debt or (B) obligating any Company to issue, grant, extend or
enter into any such option, warrant, call, right,  security, commitment,
Contract, arrangement or undertaking (each, a " _Company Stock Right_ "). None
of the Transferred Equity Interests are subject to vesting or  forfeiture
conditions or a right of repurchase by any of the Companies. All of the
Transferred Equity Interests have been validly issued and are not subject to

so-called controlled group basis with  reference to any provision of Section
52(a) or Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA, as applicable, that
is due to a Company or its Affiliates' affiliation with (i) any of their

Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller and Intermediate Holdco, as

SECTION 4.01 _Organization and Standing; Power_.        Purchaser is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent the
concept is recognized by the applicable jurisdiction) under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized. Purchaser has full corporate or other 
organizational power and authority to enable it to own the Transferred Equity
Interests, to execute this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions.
Purchaser has, or will have at the Closing, as applicable, full corporate or
other  organizational power and authority to execute each other Transaction
Agreement to which it is or will be party and to consummate the Transactions.
Purchaser has full corporate or other power and authority to enable it to own,
lease or  otherwise hold its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently owned or conducted, except where the failure to have
such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or  materially impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay, the consummation of the Transactions by Purchaser (a "
_Purchaser Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 


 

 

SECTION 4.02 _Authority; Execution and  Delivery; Enforceability_. The
execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation by
Purchaser of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other organizational action and no  other action or proceeding
on the part of Purchaser or its stockholders or other equityholders is
necessary to authorize this Agreement. Purchaser has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement, assuming the due 
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, constitutes
its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent 
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a Proceeding in equity or at Law). The execution and delivery by
each of  Purchaser and each other Affiliate of Purchaser that will be a party
to a Transaction Agreement (such Affiliates, the " _Purchasing Affiliates_ ")
of each other  Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be party and the
consummation by each of Purchaser and each Purchasing Affiliate of the
Transactions have been, or will be at the Closing, as applicable, duly
authorized by all necessary corporate or  other organizational action and no
other action or proceeding on the part of Purchaser or any of the Purchasing
Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders or other equityholders is
necessary to authorize the Transaction Agreements or  the Transactions. Each
of Purchaser and each Purchasing Affiliate has, or will have at the Closing,
as applicable, duly executed and delivered each other Transaction Agreement to
which it is or will be party, and such Transaction Agreement,  assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of such Transaction Agreement by
Seller or a Selling Affiliate, constitutes or will constitute its legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, 
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other Laws relating to or affecting creditors'
rights generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a
Proceeding in  equity or at Law).

 


 

 


 

  31

 

 


 

 


 

 

SECTION 4.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_.        (a) The execution,
delivery and performance by each of Purchaser and each Purchasing Affiliate of
each Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be a party, the consummation
of the Transactions and the compliance by each of Purchaser and  each
Purchasing Affiliate with the terms thereof will not conflict with, or result
in any violation of or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation
or  acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than any Permitted Liens) upon any
of the properties or assets of Purchaser or any Purchasing Affiliate
(including any assets  held under a lease or license) under, (i) the
organizational documents of Purchaser or any of the Purchasing Affiliates or
(ii) (A) any Contract by which Purchaser or any of the Purchasing Affiliates
or by which any of their respective  properties or assets is bound or (B) any
Judgment or applicable Law applicable to Purchaser or any of the Purchasing
Affiliates or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clause (ii) above, any such items that,  individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

(b) Assuming the truth and accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Seller relating  to Seller, the Transferred Equity Interests and the
Companies set forth in _Article II_ (Representations and Warranties Relating
to Seller, Intermediate Holdco and the Transferred Equity Interests) and
_Article III_ (Representations and Warranties Relating to the Companies), no
Consent of or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is  required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
Purchaser or any of the Purchasing Affiliates in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Agreements or the consummation of  the Transactions, other than
(i) the Required Regulatory Approvals, (ii) those that may be required solely
by reason of the participation of Seller and the Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates (as opposed to any other third Person)  in the
Transactions and (iii) those the failure of which to obtain or make,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.04 _Proceedings_. There  are not any (a) outstanding Judgments
against Purchaser or any Purchasing Affiliates, (b) Proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of the
Purchasing Affiliates, or (c) investigations by any  Governmental Entity that
are, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, pending or threatened against Purchaser or
any of the Purchasing Affiliates that, in any such case, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser  Material
Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.05 _Securities Act_.   Purchaser is acquiring the Transferred
Equity Interests for investment only and not with a view to any public
distribution thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that the Transferred Equity
Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other
federal, state, foreign or local securities Law, and  agrees that the
Transferred Equity Interests may not be sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to
an exemption from such registration available under the Securities Act, and 
in compliance with any other federal, state, foreign or local securities Law,
in each case, to the extent applicable.

SECTION 4.06 _Financing_. (a)   Purchaser has delivered to Seller true,
correct and complete copies of (i) a fully executed commitment letter, each
dated on or about the date of this Agreement, from each of (A) WaveDivision
Capital VII, LLC, (B) Searchlight Capital II, L.P.  and Searchlight Capital
II PV, L.P., (C) Port-aux-Choix Private Investments Inc., (D) IMCPE 2019 Inc.
and (E) Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (each such commitment letter,
together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets  attached
thereto and as each may be amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or
extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with
_Section 5.18_  (Financing), is referred to as an " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ "), in each case  providing for an equity investment in Purchaser,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, in cash in the aggregate amount
set forth therein (collectively, the " _Equity  Financing_ "); and (ii) a
fully executed commitment letter (and Redacted Fee Letter) dated on or about
the date of this Agreement from the financial institutions identified therein
(as such parties may be supplemented or amended  from time to time, the "
_Lenders_ ") (such letters, together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and
term sheets attached thereto and as amended, modified,  supplemented,
replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with _Section 5.18_ (Financing)), collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letters, the "
_Financing Letters_ "), providing, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, for debt financing in cash in the amounts set forth therein
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity
Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of  this Agreement, none of
the Financing Letters in the form delivered to Seller has been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated (other than
amendments to the Debt Commitment Letter to add additional commitment 
parties thereto as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and in
accordance with _Section 5.18_ (Financing)), and none of the obligations or
commitments contained therein have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in
any respect and no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated.
Purchaser  has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other fees in
connection with the Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the date
of this Agreement. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Financing Letters, the net  proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters
(after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and
similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of
flex (including original issue discount flex)  provided under the Debt
Commitment Letter) will in the aggregate be sufficient to enable Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions (including paying related fees, costs and
expenses) (collectively, the " _Required Amount_ ") and otherwise perform its
obligations hereunder. As of the date hereof, each Financing Letter in the
form delivered to Seller (x) constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of  Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the
other parties thereto, (y) is enforceable in accordance with its terms against
Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each of the other parties
thereto, subject to the effects of  bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law) and (z) is  in full force and
effect. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article II_ (Representations and Warranties Relating to Seller,
Intermediate Holdco and the Transferred Equity Interests) and _Article III_
(Representations and Warranties Relating to the Companies) and the performance
by Seller of its obligations hereunder, as of the date of this Agreement, no 
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part
of Purchaser or, to the

 


 

 


 

 

  33

 

 


 


 

 

Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party thereto under any Financing Letter or
otherwise cause any portion of the Financing to  be unavailable or delayed.
As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser does not have any reason to
believe that it or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any conditions to funding under any Financing Letter  required
to be satisfied by it, that the conditions thereof will not otherwise be
satisfied, or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available, in
each case on the Closing Date assuming compliance by Seller with this
Agreement and  the satisfaction (or to the extent permitted, waiver) of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (Conditions Precedent) (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing).
The  only conditions precedent or other contingencies (including the market
flex provisions) related to the obligations of the parties to the Equity
Commitment Letters to fund their respective portions of the full amount of the
Equity Financing and  the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt
Financing are those expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters and
the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no side letters (other than bond  placement engagement letters and
fee credit letters) or any other Contracts, arrangements or understandings to
which Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof is a party related to the Financing
other than as expressly contained in the Financing  Letters and delivered to
Seller prior to the date of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to
consummate the  Transactions and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article II_ (Representations and Warranties Relating
to Seller, Intermediate Holdco and the Transferred Equity Interests) and
_Article III_ (Representations and Warranties Relating to the Companies)
hereof in all material respects, and after giving effect to the Transactions
(including the  Financing) and the payment of the Purchase Price, Purchaser
will be Solvent immediately after the Closing.

expressly set forth in _Article II_ (Representations and Warranties Relating

Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their respective representatives by or on
behalf of Seller or any Company, and that any such  representations or

relating to Seller, the Transferred Equity Interests or the Companies, or any

materials made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives, whether orally or in writing, in any data room,
offering memoranda, confidential information memoranda, management 
presentations (formal or informal), functional "break-out" discussions,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates or
in any other form in connection with the Transactions, and that any such
representations and  warranties are expressly disclaimed.

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) there are uncertainties
inherent in preparing and making the Projections, (ii) Purchaser is familiar
with such uncertainties and (iii) Purchaser is not relying on the Projections
and is taking full  responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of the Projections.

 


 

 

(d) Purchaser       further acknowledges and agrees that no
representative of Seller, the Companies or their respective Affiliates has any
authority, express or  implied, to make any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements not specifically set forth in this Agreement. Except
as expressly set forth in _Article II_  (Representations and Warranties
Relating to Seller, Intermediate Holdco and the Transferred Equity Interests),
_Article III_ (Representations and Warranties Relating to the Companies) or
any other Transaction Agreement, no  representation or warranty (express or
implied) is made with respect to the value, condition, non-infringement,
merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose as to the
Transferred Equity Interests or any of the properties or  assets of the
Companies.

 


 

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section  4.07_ shall limit claims by Purchaser for
Actual Fraud.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.08 _Independent Investigation_.        Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that (a) it is sophisticated and knowledgeable about the industry
in which each Company operates, (b) it has conducted  its own independent
investigation, review and analysis of the Business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects of the Companies, which investigation,
review and analysis was conducted solely by Purchaser and its representatives,
(c) it has had the opportunity to request access to the books and records,
facilities, equipment, Tax Returns, Contracts and other properties and 
assets of the Companies that it and its representatives have desired and have
received responses they deem adequate and sufficient to all such requests, and
it and its representatives have had the opportunity to meet with the officers
and  employees of the Companies to discuss the Business and (d) it is
purchasing the Transferred Equity Interests based solely upon the results of
the  aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and the
representations and warranties made to it in _Article II_ (Representations and
Warranties Relating to Seller, Intermediate Holdco and the Transferred Equity
Interests), _Article III_  (Representations and Warranties Relating to the
Companies) and the other Transaction Agreements, and not in reliance on any
representation or warranty of  Seller, the

Companies, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives not expressly set forth therein.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.09 _Brokers or Finders_.   No agent, broker, investment banker or
other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any broker's, finder's,

of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, except any Person whose fees and
expenses will be paid by Purchaser.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.10 _Guarantee_.   Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Purchaser has delivered to Seller the duly executed guarantees of
the Guarantors, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of Seller in

SECTION 5.02 _Access to Information;  Consultation_. (a) From the date of

Purchaser and its accountants, counsel, other representatives and Lenders
reasonable access, upon reasonable

 


 

 


 

  40

 

 


 

 


 

 

notice during normal business hours, to all the personnel, properties
(including facilities, plant and network locations for  equipment,
installation with contractors, connection to power and fiber, it being
understood that the preliminary list of sites to which Purchaser will be
granted such access is set forth on Section 5.02 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, which  list will be subject to update as reasonably agreed between
Seller and Purchaser between the date hereof and the Closing), books,
Contracts, Tax Returns and records to the extent relating to the Business
(including, for the avoidance of doubt,  any Tax Returns and Tax books and
records, together with any note papers or work papers related thereto, and
allow Purchaser and its representatives to document, observe, measure,
photograph and plan) and, during such period, shall furnish to  Purchaser any
information relating to the Business as Purchaser may reasonably request
(other than any of the foregoing that relate to the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement or any proposals from other parties relating to any
competing  or alternative transactions and any Seller Consolidated Return);
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that Purchaser and its accountants, counsel, other
representatives and Lenders shall conduct any such permitted activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the Business and pursuant
to protocols governing such access and  activities to be reasonably agreed
between Seller and Purchaser; _provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that (i)
none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide such
access if Seller determines, in its reasonable judgment, that  doing so could
reasonably be expected to (A) violate applicable Law, an applicable Judgment
or a Contract or (B) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection or other legal privilege (in each
case,  it being understood that Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access in a manner
that does not violate any such Law, Judgment or Contract or jeopardize any
such privilege or  protection) and (ii) such access shall not include any
Phase II environmental investigations or any other environmental testing or
sampling of, at or under any Company Real Property by or on behalf of
Purchaser, its accountants, counsel, other  representatives or Lenders. All
requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ shall be
directed to an executive officer or other Person  designated by Seller.

 


 

 

(b) Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed and consult and cooperate
with, and consider  in good faith the views of, Purchaser on any matters
relating to item 1 on Section 3.12 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, including
any filing, submission, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument or proposal made or  submitted in connection therewith. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any applicable
Law, in connection with such matter, Seller will permit authorized
representatives of Purchaser to be consulted in  connection with any
substantive document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with such matter.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.03 _Confidentiality_.   Purchaser agrees that the information being
provided to it in connection with the Transactions (including the terms of the
Transaction Agreements and the contents of the Seller Disclosure Letter) will
remain subject to the terms of the  confidentiality agreement, dated as of
September 27, 2018, between WDC Management, LLC and Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Effective upon the Closing, the 
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating
solely to the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser agrees that
any and all other information provided to it or any of its Affiliates, or any
of their respective representatives, by Seller or any of its

 


 

 


 

  41

 

 


 

 

 

 


 

 

Affiliates, or any of their respective representatives, shall remain subject
to the terms and conditions of the  Confidentiality Agreement after the
Closing, and Purchaser shall otherwise comply with the Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with its terms. The terms of this _Section 5.03_ 
shall not apply to communications by Purchaser to its counsel, accountants,
prospective Lender Related Parties (including communications with respect to
communications made in connection with Purchaser's financing efforts), other
professional  advisors, its limited partners and investors or its prospective
limited partners and investors, in each case who are subject to customary
confidentiality obligations.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.04 _Efforts to Consummate the  Transactions_. (a) On the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall each
use their reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another
standard of performance is expressly  provided for herein) to cause the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, including taking all reasonable
actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on it or any of its Affiliates with respect to  the Closing. Seller
and Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
Affiliates to, take any action in the Territory (including acquiring or making
any investment in any Person or any division or assets thereof in the 
Territory) that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a
material delay in the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (Conditions Precedent) or any of such conditions not being
satisfied.

 


 

 

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) as  promptly as practicable file with the appropriate
Governmental Entities any notices and applications necessary to obtain
approval under any applicable Laws for the Transactions, including the
Required Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ that, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to (and shall
cause its applicable Affiliates to) (i) make an  appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), with respect to 
the Transactions within ten Business Days following the date hereof, (ii) (x)
submit, as promptly as practicable, to CFIUS a draft CFIUS Notice with respect
to the Transactions, (y) file, as a promptly as practicable, a CFIUS Notice
with  respect to the Transactions and (z) supply, as promptly as practicable,
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested in
connection with the CFIUS review process, (iii) file all applications with the
FCC and any  applicable State Regulators that may be required by the
Communications Act or similar rules, regulations, policies, instructions and
orders of State Regulators for the transfer of control of the Transferred
Communications Licenses to Purchaser  as promptly as practicable and (iv)
make all filings and submissions required by Local Franchising Authorities in
the Territory with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable. Any
such filings shall be in compliance with the  requirements of such Laws.
Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to)
furnish each other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other may request in connection with its preparation of any  filing or
submission that is necessary under such Laws. Seller and Purchaser shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional  or supplemental information from, and shall invite the other to
attend any scheduled meetings pertaining to any such filings with, any such
Governmental Entities

 


 

 


 

  42

 

 


 

 


 

 

and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request and shall (and
shall cause their respective  Affiliates to) promptly provide any additional
or supplemental information requested in connection with any filings made
hereunder pursuant to such Laws. Any such additional or supplemental
information shall be in compliance with the  requirements of such Laws. Each
of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any clearance required under such
Laws for the consummation of the Transactions as  promptly as practicable.
Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall consent to any voluntary delay of the
Closing or extension of any applicable waiting period at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the consent of the other, such consent not  to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree
that (A) Purchaser shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all 
communications, strategy and other aspects relating to all applicable Laws in
connection with obtaining Required Regulatory Approvals or causing the waiting
periods or other requirements under such Laws to terminate or expire no later
than the  Outside Date and (B) neither the Guarantors nor any of their
Affiliates (other than Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) shall be required to
take any action in connection with the obligations to use reasonable best
efforts to obtain any clearance  required under such Laws for the
consummations of the Transactions other than responding to any reasonable
requests for information from Purchaser or Seller that may be required in
connection with any filings with any Governmental Entity  pursuant to this
_Section 5.04_.

 


 

 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 5.04_,  the "reasonable best efforts" of
Purchaser shall include (i) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
avoid any Proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
the Transactions as violative of any Law,  (ii) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines,
assets or operations of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or of  the
Companies, (iii) conducting its and its Affiliates' businesses or the
Companies' businesses in a specified manner, or proposing and agreeing or
permitting to conduct any of such businesses in a specified manner, or
committing to make  capital expenditures or other expenditures in the
Territory, including, in each case, by agreeing to undertakings required by a
Governmental Entity that it or any of its Affiliates or any Company will take,
or refrain from taking, any action,  and (iv) otherwise taking or committing
to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Purchaser's or its
Affiliates' ability to retain one or more of the businesses, product lines,
assets or operations of Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates or any Company,
in each case, to the extent necessary to obtain any such clearance, resolve
any such objections or avoid or eliminate any such impediments (the actions
described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the " _Remedy Actions_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that the effectiveness of any such Remedy Action
shall be conditioned upon the Closing; _provided_ _further_   that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of
Purchaser under this _Section 5.04(c)_ shall not include Purchaser committing
to  (whether or not conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing) taking
any Remedy Action if such action, individually or together with any other
proposed Remedy Action(s), and when combined with the Required Payment Amount
and any other  payments or costs incurred or borne by Purchaser to obtain any
of the Required Regulatory Approvals, would or would reasonably be expected to
materially

 


 

 


 

 

  43

 

 


   


 

 

diminish the commercial value of, or result in an impact that is materially
adverse to, or cost that is  material to, the assets, business, results of
operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Companies (taken as a
whole) or the Business (after giving effect to the Closing and the
transactions contemplated hereby to occur on or prior  to the Closing), but
disregarding for this purpose any Remedy Action that is consistent with
Purchaser's plans for developing the Business as of the date hereof or is
otherwise proposed or offered by Purchaser in its discretion in an initial 
application for an order approving the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). For the avoidance of doubt and 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.04_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other
than  any Company effective upon the Closing) shall be required to (A) make
any payment or incur any cost in order to obtain any of the Required
Regulatory Approvals (other than (x) payments or costs related to the Business
that result in a  dollar-for-dollar payment to Seller as a Required Payment
Amount and (y) legal and accounting fees and disbursements and regulatory
filing fees and related incidental costs and expenses (this clause (y), the "
_Incidental Expenses_ ")) or (B) sell, divest, dispose of or enter into any
other arrangements or take any other Remedy Action with respect to, their
businesses, product lines, assets or  operations pursuant to this _Section
5.04_ or any other provision of this Agreement, and the "reasonable best
efforts" of Seller shall not include making any  such payments, incurring any
such costs or taking any such Remedy Actions.

 


 

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.04_, Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to), to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) give each other prompt
notice of the making or  commencement of any request, inquiry or Proceeding
by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, (ii)
keep each other reasonably informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry or Proceeding, (iii) promptly  inform each other of any substantive
communication (and provide each other with copies of all written
communications) to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions,
(iv) consult and cooperate with each other in good faith in  connection with
any meetings or oral communications, formal or informal, with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, provide each other with advance notice and an 
opportunity to attend and participate in all such meetings and oral
communications and (v) consult and cooperate with each other in good faith in
connection with, and provide each other with reasonable advance opportunity to
review and comment  upon (and each will consider in good faith the views of
the other in connection with), any filing, registration, declaration, notice,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion,
proposal or other communication,  oral or written, made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions. Notwithstanding any provisions
of this _Section 5.04_ to the contrary,  (x) materials provided to the other
party pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ may be redacted (A) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Companies, (B) as  necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address privilege or
confidentiality concerns and (y) each party shall have the right to reasonably
designate information provided to the other party as for the other  side's
outside counsel only.

 


 

 


 

  44

 

 


 

 


 

 

(e) Other than with respect to Seller's obligations under _Section 5.01_
(Covenants Relating to Conduct of Business), nothing in this Agreement shall
(i) apply to or  restrict communications or other actions by any Company with
or with respect to Governmental Entities in connection with its business in
the ordinary course of business or (ii) give Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or  direct the operations of any Company
prior to the Closing.

 


 

 

(f) Prior to the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use its reasonable  best efforts (at its own expense) to obtain, and to
cooperate in obtaining, all Consents from Persons (other than any Governmental
Entity) necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction  Agreement, the parties
shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any
obligation or grant any concession in favor of) any such Person (other than
the reimbursement of such Person's reasonable expenses in connection  with
obtaining such consent).

 


 

 

(g) To the extent necessary to comply with any state Laws and regulations and
the rules,  regulations, written policies, instructions and orders of the
FCC, including those prohibiting "slamming" as set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section
64.1120, at least 60 calendar days prior to the estimated Closing Date (as
reasonably estimated by the  parties), (i) Purchaser shall, at its own
expense, prepare and deliver to Seller a draft notice providing the
information required by 47 C.F.R. Section 64.1120(e) addressed to the
telecommunications customers of the Business, it being  understood that
Seller shall have the opportunity to review and comment on the contents of
such notice and Purchaser shall give reasonable consideration to any comment
proposed by Seller and (ii) Seller shall, at Purchaser's cost and expense 
(which shall be a reimbursement of Seller's reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses), cause such notice to be delivered to such
customers at least 30 calendar days before the estimated Closing Date (as
reasonably estimated by  the parties) by a direct mailing or in accordance
with such method of notice and notification period that the FCC or applicable
State Regulators may order or require. Seller will be responsible for
preparing, distributing and filing (at  Purchaser's expense) any notices
relating to "discontinuance, reduction, or impairment" of service to the
customers of the Business required by 47 C.F.R. Sections 63.19 and 63.71.

 


 

 

(h) Subject to the preceding provisions of this _Section 5.04_, from time to
time, as and when requested by any party hereto, each other party hereto shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and  shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further
actions, as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
consummate the Transactions, including, in the case of Seller and its
Affiliates, executing and delivering to  Purchaser such assignments, deeds,
bills of sale and other instruments as Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably
request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

 


 

 

(i) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective periods  of any Required Regulatory Approval, and neither party
shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, then each
of Purchaser and Seller

 


 

 


 

  45

 

 


 

 


 

 

shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of
the effective period of each  such Required Regulatory Approval to permit
consummation of the Transactions in accordance with this Agreement. Upon
receipt of the Required Regulatory Approvals, the parties hereto shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to  maintain in effect the Required
Regulatory Approvals to permit consummation of the Transactions in accordance
with this Agreement. No such extension of any Required Regulatory Approvals
shall limit the right of Seller and Purchaser to  terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms hereof.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.05 _Expenses_. Whether or  not the Closing takes place, except as
expressly set forth in any other provision of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the  Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

 

 

 


 

 

SECTION 5.06 _Employee Matters_. (a) Seller shall  comply with any legal or
contractual notice requirements to labor unions representing the Employees of
the Business and, where required, to Employees of the Business antecedent to
Closing, provided Seller shall consult with and obtain agreement  of
Purchaser on the content of any such notification or communication that
address, directly or indirectly, Purchaser's intentions with respect to
purchased operations and the Employees of the Business (such agreement not to
be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

(b) No later than 30 calendar days prior to the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates shall take  such steps as are required to (i) transfer the
employment of each Employee of the Business to a Company and (ii) transfer the
employment of each employee who is not an Employee of the Business from the
applicable Company to Seller and its  Affiliates (other than the Companies).
No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser an updated _Section 9.06(b)(iii)_ of  the Seller Disclosure Letter
listing the Employees of the Business as of the Closing Date, which shall
include the names of the Employees of the Business.

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser shall cause the Companies to take all actions necessary to adopt
and assume the  Collective Bargaining Agreements effective as of the Closing
Date so that, effective immediately following the Closing, the Companies shall
assume and be liable for all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates under
the Collective Bargaining  Agreements with respect to the Transferred
Employees. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) to, provide the
Transferred Employees who are covered by the  Collective Bargaining
Agreements with the compensation and benefits required by such Collective
Bargaining Agreements. For avoidance of doubt, the assumption of the
Collective Bargaining Agreements by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, 
after the Closing, the Companies), means that Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) assume all liabilities relating
to Business Employee Benefit Plans or other benefit plans required to be
maintained for  those Transferred Employees who are covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreements, including any retiree medical and/or retiree life
insurance benefits (the " _Retiree Medical  Benefits_ ") or defined benefit
pension plan benefits.

 


 

  
 

  46

 

 


  
 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, retain all liabilities for  Retiree Medical Benefits and defined benefit
pension plan benefits related to any individual who is (or was) covered by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement and who, as of the Closing, is no longer
employed by Seller or the Companies and Purchaser  and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall have no liability for
Retiree Medical Benefits and defined benefit pension plan benefits related to
such individual and shall indemnify Purchaser for any such liability in 
accordance with _Section 5.06(g)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
retained liabilities described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be
Excluded  Liabilities.

 


 

 

(d) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its  Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) to,
provide to each Transferred Employee who is not covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement, (i) a base salary or wages no less favorable than, and
(ii) other employee benefits  (excluding any equity or equity-based benefits,
retiree medical and retiree life insurance benefits and defined benefit
pension plans) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), those  provided to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies)
to, provide to each Transferred Employee whose employment is  terminated by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Companies) prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date, severance
and termination benefits in an amount equal to the severance and termination 
benefits that would have been due to such Transferred Employee in the event of
such termination under the applicable Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements in
which such Transferred Employee participated in or was a party to as in effect
as of  immediately prior to the Closing Date as set forth on _Section
5.06(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter taking into account such Transferred
Employee's service with  Seller and its Affiliates (including the applicable
Company) and any of their respective predecessors prior to the Closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, severance may be conditioned on a release of
claims and compliance with  post-employment restrictive covenants. Effective
as of the Closing, each Transferred Employee shall cease to be an employee of
Seller or the applicable Subsidiary of Seller, without any interruption or
cessation of employment or break in  service, and shall cease to participate
in any Benefit Plan (other than any Business Employee Benefit Plan) as an
active employee.

 


 

 

(e) (i) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates  (including, after the Closing, the Companies) to, (A) honor all
obligations accrued under the Business Employee Benefit Plans as of the
Closing in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing with respect to  Transferred Employees and (B) recognize all of each
Transferred Employee's accrued and unused vacation and other paid time-off
benefits as in effect immediately prior to the Closing to the extent included
in the Closing Working Capital in the  Final Closing Statement.

 


 

 

(ii) Except as set forth in the following sentence, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates (including,  after the Closing, the Companies) to,
permit each Transferred Employee who is not covered by a Collective Bargaining
Agreement and who participates in a quarterly bonus or commission plan as of
immediately

 


 

 


 

  47

 

 


 

 


 

 

prior to the Closing Date to participate in a quarterly bonus plan or
commission plan, as applicable,  maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates,
with eligibility to earn a bonus or commission, as applicable, under such plan
for the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs (i.e., including any
portion of such quarter elapsed prior to the Closing), without proration.
Solely with respect to Transferred Employees who are not covered by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement, (A)  Seller shall make a prorated quarterly
bonus payment or commission payment, as applicable, to each such Transferred
Employee in respect of the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs equal
to the product of (x) the amount of the bonus or  commission, as applicable,
that would have been payable to such Transferred Employee under the applicable
Seller quarterly bonus plan or commission plan, as applicable, based on actual
performance through the end of the applicable performance  period or
commission period, as applicable, as determined by Seller in its reasonable
discretion pursuant to the terms of such plan, multiplied by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in such calendar quarter that 
elapsed prior to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number
of days in such calendar quarter and (B) Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall not be required to provide
such Transferred  Employees the opportunity to earn a bonus or commission, as
applicable, for the portion of the calendar quarter in which the Closing
occurs that elapsed prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall pay such quarterly
bonus payment or commission  payment, as applicable, on the earlier of (x)
the time quarterly bonuses or commission payments, as applicable, for such
calendar quarter are paid to similarly situated employees of Seller and its
Affiliates and (y) 75 days after the end of  such calendar quarter. Seller
shall not be responsible for making any payments to Transferred Employees who
are covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements with respect to the
performance period or commission period, as applicable, in which  the Closing
occurs under any incentive plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates.

 


 

 

(f) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions of
any Collective  Bargaining Agreements, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) to, recognize, for
eligibility, vesting and accrual purposes (other than benefit accruals under a
defined benefit pension plan,  other than the Accrued DB Benefits, or retiree
medical plan) under the plans, programs and arrangements established or
maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Companies), each Transferred Employee's  service with Seller and
its Affiliates (including the Companies) and any of their respective
predecessors; _provided_ that no such recognition of service shall be 
required to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 


 

 

(g) (i) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither
Purchaser nor any of  its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Companies) shall assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise
discharge, and Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall remain liable
to pay, perform and discharge when due, all  employment, labor, compensation,
severance, redundancy, termination, pension, employee welfare and employee
benefits related liabilities, obligations, commitments,

 


 

 


 

  48

 

 


 

 


 

 

claims and losses relating to each employee or former employee of Seller and
its Affiliates (or any  dependent or beneficiary thereof) who is not a
Transferred Employee and Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for any such
liability.

 


 

 

(ii) Seller and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and
its Affiliates for any Losses  incurred by Purchaser resulting from or
arising out of any material change to Seller's Benefit Plans solely with
respect to those Employees of the Business or Former Employees of the Business
(excluding Transferred Employees) covered by (or  previously covered by) a
Collective Bargaining Agreement for whom Seller has retained liability for
post-retirement Retiree Medical Benefits under _Section 5.06(c)_.   Any
indemnification under this _Section 5.06(g)_ shall be governed by _Section
8.01(a)(ii)_   and such indemnification shall not expire until Seller's
retained liability for such post-retirement retiree medical or life insurance
benefits has been paid, performed and discharged when due.

 


 

 

(iii) Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Companies) shall assume and shall be solely  responsible for all liabilities
that may result from claims made by any Employee of the Business for any
severance, redundancy or similar termination payments or benefits arising out
of, relating to or in connection with the employment or  termination of
employment of any Transferred Employee by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, any Company) following the Closing.

 


 

 

(h) (i) No later than the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates  (including, after the Closing, the Companies) to, have in effect
one or more defined contribution plans that each include a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
(collectively, " _Purchaser 's 401(k) Plan_") that will provide benefits to
Transferred Employees participating in Seller's 401(k) Savings Plan (" _Seller
's 401(k) Plan_") as of the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, but
subject to the asset transfer specified in _Section  5.06(h)(ii)_ ,
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan shall assume and be solely responsible for all
liabilities for or relating to the Transferred Employees' accounts in the
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan. Purchaser or its Affiliates (including after  the
Closing, the Companies) shall be solely responsible for all ongoing rights of
or relating to the Transferred Employees for future participation (including,
but not limited to, the right to make contributions through payroll
deductions) in  Purchaser's 401(k) Plan.

 


 

 

(ii) Effective as of or as soon as administratively practicable (but no later
than ten days)  after the Closing, Seller shall cause the account balances
(including, but not limited to, any outstanding loan balances) in Seller's
401(k) Plan attributable to the Transferred Employees to transfer to
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan in the form of  (x) promissory notes, to the extent
of the account balances of the Transferred Employees that represent
outstanding loans or (y) cash, to the extent of the account balances of the
Transferred Employees that do not represent outstanding loans of  Transferred
Employees. Purchaser shall cause Purchaser's 401(k) Plan to accept such
transfer of accounts and underlying assets and, effective as of the date of
such transfer, to assume and to fully perform, pay or

 


 

 


 

  49

 

 


 

 


 

 

discharge, the obligations relating to the accounts of Transferred Employees
in accordance with any  applicable legal requirements (including Section
414(l) of the Code). The transfers shall be conducted in accordance with the
terms of Seller's 401(k) Plan, Section 414(l) of the Code, Treasury Regulation
1.414(l)-1 and Section 208 of ERISA.   In the event that any circumstance or
any event arises or occurs prior to such transfer that could reasonably be
expected to cause Seller's 401(k) Plan to cease to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, Seller shall  promptly notify
Purchaser of such circumstance or event and in such case, Purchaser shall not
be required to accept the transfer of accounts or any liability thereto, if
such transfer would adversely affect the tax qualification of Purchaser's 
401(k) Plan and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to enable the
transfer without adverse tax consequences. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith in implementing appropriate communications,
transferring appropriate records  and taking any other actions reasonably
required to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 5.06(h)_.

 


 

 

(i) (i) With respect to each defined benefit pension plan, program, agreement
or arrangement that  is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that
is sponsored or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates and in which any
Employee of the Business participates (each, a " _Business       Pension
Plan_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Companies) to, have in effect a defined benefit pension plan that
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code  (each, a "
_Purchaser Pension Plan_ ") and a related trust that is exempt from tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code (each, a " _Purchaser Pension Plan Trust_ "). Each
Purchaser Pension Plan shall be established and maintained for the benefit of
the Transferred Employees who participated in the corresponding Business
Pension Plan as of  immediately prior to the Closing, and each such
Transferred Employee shall become a participant in such Purchaser Pension
Plan. Purchaser shall be responsible for taking or causing to be taken all
necessary, reasonable and appropriate action  to establish, maintain and
administer a Purchaser Pension Plan so that it qualifies under Section 401(a)
of the Code and a Purchaser Pension Plan Trust that is exempt from Federal
income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code.

 


 

 

(ii) No later than immediately prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its  Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) to,
provide that each Purchaser Pension Plan shall assume all liabilities and
obligations of Seller and its Affiliates for the benefits accrued by the
Transferred Employees under the  applicable Business Pension Plan as of
immediately prior to the Closing (such benefits, collectively, the " _Accrued
DB Benefits_ "); _provided_ that, for the period between the Closing and the
applicable Transfer Date (as defined below), Seller or its Affiliates shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, cause the  applicable Business
Pension Plan to continue to make benefit payments to such Transferred
Employees in respect of the Accrued DB Benefits.

 


 

 

(iii) Each Purchaser Pension Plan and each Purchaser Pension Plan Trust (and
any successors to  such plan and/or trust) shall (A) provide that with
respect to assets transferred to such Purchaser Pension Plan from the
applicable Business

 


 

 


 

  50

 

 


 

 


 

 

Pension Plan in accordance with this _Section 5.06(i)_ , such assets shall be
held by the applicable Purchaser Pension Plan Trust for the exclusive benefit
of the participants in such Purchaser Pension Plan; (B) provide that the
Accrued DB Benefits may  not be decreased by amendment or otherwise, and (C)
have terms and features (including employer contribution provisions and
elections in respect of form of payment of Accrued DB Benefits) that are
substantially identical to the applicable  Business Pension Plan, such that
each Business Pension Plan is substantially replaced by a corresponding
Purchaser Pension Plan.

 


 

 

(iv) Effective as of the Closing Date and subject to this _Section
5.06(i)(iv)_ with respect to each Purchaser Pension Plan, Seller and its
Affiliates shall procure that the trustee of the applicable Business Pension
Plan shall transfer to the trustee of  such Purchaser Pension Plan assets
equal to a reasonable estimate of the amount required to be transferred
pursuant to Section 414(l) of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, may be, if applicable, the "de minimis" amount
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(l)-1(h)) using the actuarial
assumptions and methodology deemed reasonable by Seller in its  sole
discretion (for the avoidance of doubt, such actuarial assumptions and
methodology need not include the safe harbor assumptions specified in Section
414(l) of the Code or Section 4044 of ERISA), subject to any requirements
under such  Sections of the Code and ERISA (each such required amount, a "
_Section 4044 Amount_ " and each such reasonable estimate, an " _Initial
Pension Transfer Amount_ "). For purposes of this _Section 5.06(i)(iv)_ , to
the extent permitted by Law or regulation, the  fair market value of the
assets of the Business Pension Plans shall be based on actual market values as
of the Closing.

 


 

 

(v) As soon as practicable following the Closing, but no later than 180
calendar days after the  Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Purchaser (or
an actuary designated by Purchaser) (A) updated calculations of each Section
4044 Amount (each, a " _Final Pension Transfer  Amount_ ") determined by an
enrolled actuary designated by Seller and (B) all information reasonably
necessary to calculate such Final Pension Transfer Amount and to verify that
such calculations have been performed in a manner  consistent with Section
414(l) of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA and in accordance with the
Pension Principles. Within 45 calendar days following receipt by Purchaser (or
an actuary designated by Purchaser) of Seller's actuary's  calculation of a
Final Pension Transfer Amount and the information described in clause (B) of
the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing if there is a
good faith dispute as to whether Seller's actuary's calculation of such 
Final Pension Transfer Amount, as applicable, is in violation of applicable
Law or regulation or contains errors of a mathematical nature or is not in
accordance with the Pension Principles. If Purchaser does not notify Seller of
any such good  faith dispute within such 45 calendar day period, the
determination of Seller's actuary shall become conclusive, final and binding.
If any such dispute remains unresolved for 45 calendar days following Seller's
receipt of such written  notification from Purchaser (or within such longer
period as Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree), Seller and Purchaser
shall (in writing) select and appoint an actuary (the cost of which shall be
borne equally by

 


 

 


 

  51

 

 


 

 


 

 

Seller and Purchaser), who shall make a final and binding determination of the
applicable Final Pension  Transfer Amount in accordance with applicable law
or regulation. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall be responsible for the cost
of its own actuary. Seller's actuary shall be responsible for any required
actuarial certification under  Section 414(l) of the Code.

 


 

 

(vi) If the differential between an Initial Pension Transfer Amount and the
applicable Final  Pension Transfer Amount (each, a " _Differential Amount_ ")
is positive (i.e., an  Initial Pension Transfer Amount is less than the
applicable Final Pension Transfer Amount), then, within five Business Days
following the final determination of the applicable Final Pension Transfer
Amount, Seller and its Affiliates shall  procure that the trustee of the
applicable Business Pension Plan shall transfer to the trustee of the
applicable Purchaser Pension Plan assets equal to the applicable Differential
Amount, _plus_ , for the period between the Closing and the date such assets
are transferred (each, a " _Transfer Date_ "), an interest increment on the 
applicable Differential Amount at the rate equal to the actual rate of return
earned by the related trust, as determined by the trustee of the applicable
Business Pension Plan, through the end of the calendar month preceding the
applicable  Transfer Date. If a Differential Amount is negative (i.e., an
Initial Pension Transfer Amount is more than the applicable Final Pension
Transfer Amount),  then, within five Business Days following the final
determination of the applicable Final Pension Transfer Amount, Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall procure that the trustee of the applicable Purchaser
Pension Plan shall transfer to the  trustee of the applicable Business
Pension Plan assets equal to the applicable Differential Amount, _plus_ , for
the period between the Closing and applicable Transfer  Date, an interest
increment on the applicable Differential Amount at the rate equal to the
actual rate of return earned by such Purchaser Pension Plan's related trust,
as determined by the applicable trustee, through the end of the calendar 
month preceding the applicable Transfer Date. For purposes of this _Section
5.06(i)(vi)_ , to the extent permitted by Law or regulation, the fair market
value of the  assets of the Business Pension Plans shall be based on actual
market values as of the Closing.

 


 

 

(vii) Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate to make any and all
filings and submissions  to the appropriate Governmental Entities required to
be made by Seller or Purchaser in effectuating the provisions of this _Section
5.06(i)(vii)_, with each of Seller  and Purchaser fulfilling the requirements
applicable to it, including (A) IRS Forms 5310-A in respect of the transfers
of assets and (B) in the event that the Transactions constitute a "reportable
event" (within the meaning of Section 4043 of  ERISA) for which the 30-day
notice has not been waived, timely notification of the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation and filing of all reports required in connection
therewith.

 


 

 

(viii) Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Pension Plan to recognize and
maintain all existing  elections, including, but not limited to, beneficiary
designations, required minimum distributions, payment forms and other rights
of alternate payees under qualified domestic relation orders as were in effect
under

 


 

 


 

  52

 

 


 

 


 

 

the corresponding Business Pension Plan, unless and until changed or modified
in accordance with the  terms of the applicable plan or otherwise in
accordance with applicable Law. To the extent applicable, the provisions of
this _Section 5.06(i)(viii)_ shall  apply to the Transferred Employees'
eligible dependents. At or as soon as administratively practicable following
the Closing, Seller shall provide to Purchaser copies of all such beneficiary
designations, payment forms and all other documents,  files and other
information that Purchaser may need to administer each Purchaser Pension Plan
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Seller shall cooperate in
good faith with Purchaser to effectuate the provisions of this _Section
5.06(i)(viii)_.

 


 

 

(j) (i) No later than the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates  (including, after the Closing, the Companies) to, have in effect
plans that are "employee welfare benefit plans" within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA (" _Purchaser 's Welfare  Plans_") to provide the benefits
described in _Section 5.06(d)_. Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the  Companies) to, (A) waive any pre-existing
condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all
Purchaser's Welfare Plans for the benefit of Transferred Employees, except to
the extent such pre-existing condition,  exclusion, requirement or waiting
period would have been applicable under a similar Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement in effect immediately prior to the Closing and (B) provide full
credit for any deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or any  other similar out-
of-pocket payments made or incurred by Transferred Employees prior to the
Closing Date for the plan year in which the Closing occurs.

 


 

 

(ii) Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates (other than the Companies)
to be, responsible  for all (A) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug
claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or his or her
dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits
incurred by any Transferred Employee  and (C) claims for group life, travel
and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits
incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each case, prior to the Closing.
Purchaser shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates  (including, after the
Closing, the Companies) to be, responsible for all (I) medical, vision, dental
and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee
or his or her dependents, (II) claims for short-term and  long-term
disability income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (III)
claims for group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and
dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each
case, on or  after the Closing under any Business Employee Benefit Plan.
Except in the event of any claim for workers compensation benefits, for
purposes of this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities shall be
deemed to be incurred, subject to the  terms and conditions of the applicable
employee benefit plan, as follows: (1) medical, vision, dental and/or
prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses), upon provision of
the services, materials or supplies comprising any such  benefits and (2)
short and long-term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment and
business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death, illness, injury
or accident giving rise to such benefits.

 


 

 


 

  53

 

 


 

 


 

 

(iii) Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies) shall be
responsible for all claims  for workers compensation benefits or any other
liabilities relating to any and all workers compensation claims, events and/or
coverage, whether arising under any law of any state or otherwise, including
any expenses that would be reimbursable  or subject to a deductible under the
applicable workers compensation policy (such liabilities, " _Workers
Compensation Liabilities_ ") that are incurred prior to the  Closing by any
Transferred Employee. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Companies) shall be responsible for all claims for workers
compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the Closing by any
Transferred  Employee. A claim for workers compensation benefits shall be
deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the Workers Compensation
Liabilities thereunder (the " _Workers  Compensation Event_ ") occurs,
without regard to when such claim is reported by any Transferred Employee. If
the Workers Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and
following the Closing, the claim and the Workers  Compensation Liabilities
thereunder shall be the joint responsibility of Seller and Purchaser and shall
be equitably apportioned between Seller and Purchaser based upon the relative
periods of time that the Workers Compensation Event transpired  preceding and
following the Closing. Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in the
administration of any workers compensation claim to the extent that Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, is unable to administer a claim for which it  has
Workers Compensation Liabilities pursuant to this _Section 5.06(j)(iii)_.

 


 

 

(iv) As of the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the  Companies) shall be responsible for administering compliance
with the requirements under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA, or similar state Law (" _COBRA_ "),       and the
portability requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 with respect to Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents. Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies)
shall assume or  retain any obligations under the Benefit Plans to provide
COBRA coverage to any former employees of the Companies and any of their
respective eligible dependents who (A) are enrolled in COBRA continuation
coverage as of the Closing Date or  (B) with respect to whom a COBRA
qualifying event occurred on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

  
 

 

(k) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, have in effect as of
the Closing Date flexible spending  reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria
plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (" _Purchaser 's Cafeteria
Plan_") that provide benefits to the Transferred Employees  that are
comparable to those provided to the Transferred Employees by the flexible
spending reimbursement accounts under Seller's Cafeteria Plan as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date (" _Seller 's Cafeteria Plan_").
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Companies) to, cause Purchaser's Cafeteria Plan to accept a spin-off of
the flexible spending reimbursement  accounts from flexible spending
reimbursement accounts under Seller's Cafeteria Plan and shall honor and
continue through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs the
elections made by each Transferred Employee under Seller's  Cafeteria Plan in
respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect
immediately

 


 

 


 

  54

 

 


 

 


 

 

prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Companies) to  accept for reimbursement
from the transferred flexible spending reimbursement accounts any eligible
expense that was incurred at any time during the year in which the Closing
occurs; _provided_ that such expense was not already or will not be reimbursed
by Seller's Cafeteria Plan and there is a sufficient balance in such accounts
to cover such expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser's obligation to
reimburse Seller is subject to the receipt of adequate  documentation, as
reasonably requested by Purchaser, from Seller. As soon as practicable
following the Closing, Seller shall cause to be transferred from Seller's
Cafeteria Plan to Purchaser's Cafeteria Plan the excess, if any, of the
aggregate  accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts made during the year in which the Closing occurs by Transferred
Employees over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from
such accounts to the Transferred  Employees.

 


 

 

(l) Following the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain the
liability for retiree  medical and retiree welfare benefits related to each
Transferred Employee set forth on _Section 5.06(l)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

 


 

 

(m) Following the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Companies)
shall retain  sponsorship of all Benefit Plans, other than any Business
Employee Benefit Plan, and all liabilities thereunder, and neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall
have any liability with respect  thereto. Seller shall retain liability for
each outstanding long-term incentive award held by a Transferred Employee that
is granted under a long-term incentive plan maintained by Seller and its
Affiliates. Transferred Employees shall be  treated as though involuntarily
terminated by Seller and its Affiliates effective as of the Closing in
accordance with the terms of Seller's long-term incentive plan and the
applicable outstanding long-term incentive award agreements.

 


 

 

(n) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Companies)  to, comply with all applicable Laws, directives and
regulations relating to the Transferred Employees, including providing any
required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1998 or any similar state, local or  foreign Law which calls for advance
notification, wage or benefits continuation in the event of layoffs, closure
or all or part of a business or operation, or relocation of work (the " _WARN
Act_ "), with respect to events occurring after the Closing. Seller shall, and
shall cause each of its applicable Affiliates to, comply with all applicable
Laws, directives and regulations relating to the Employees  of the Business,
including providing any required notice under the WARN Act, with respect to
events occurring prior to the Closing.

 


 

 

(o) In connection with the transaction, the parties agree that Purchaser
shall, or shall cause  its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Companies), as the continuing or successor employer, to assume the entire Form
W-2, Form 1094 and Form 1095 reporting obligations for the Transferred
Employees for the full calendar year in  which the Closing occurs; _provided_
that, within 30 days following the Closing (or, if earlier, by January 15 of
the year following the year in which the Closing  occurs), Seller shall
provide to Purchaser, with respect to each Transferred Employee, all
information for the

 


 

  
 

  55

 

 


 


 

 

period from the beginning of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs
until the Closing Date  necessary for Purchaser to complete such reporting
obligations.

 


 

 

(p) To the extent permitted by applicable Law or Contract, Seller shall, and
shall cause its  Affiliates to, assign to Purchaser and its applicable
Affiliates the right to enforce any provisions in any agreement to which any
Transferred Employee or Employee of the Business who is not a Transferred
Employee is bound, to the extent such  provision relates primarily or
exclusively to the Business, including any assignment of inventions, work made
for hire, confidentiality, non-competition or non-solicitation provisions
contained in any such agreements.

 


 

 

(q) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and subject to
any judicial  challenge or appeal undertaken by Seller or its Affiliates, in
the event that an arbitration or judicial decision orders that a Former
Employee of the Business be reinstated to employment with back pay, Seller or
its Affiliates shall be  responsible for the back pay and any other pre-
reinstatement monetary damages or other relief awarded (including benefits-
related relief), and Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Companies) shall be responsible for  the reinstatement of the
Former Employee of the Business in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the decision; _provided_ , that Seller shall update _Section 9.06(b)(viii)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter no less frequently than monthly prior to the
Closing Date and shall also deliver to Purchaser an updated _Section
9.06(b)(viii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter on the Closing Date. Upon any
reinstatement, such Former Employee of the Business shall cease to be a
Former  Employee of the Business and shall become a Transferred Employee,
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies)
shall have the obligations in respect of such Former Employee of the Business
that it has to the  Transferred Employees generally and Seller and Purchaser
shall in good faith take such actions as shall be necessary or appropriate to
implement the provisions of this _Section  5.06(q)_ and of this Agreement
with regard to such newly characterized Transferred Employee. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall remain solely liable and shall indemnify
Purchaser for any liabilities, including Retiree  Medical Benefits and any
defined benefit pension plan liabilities, and upon written request Seller
shall promptly pay to Purchaser the amount of any such Retiree Medical
Benefits and defined benefit pension plan liability that would otherwise  be
an obligation of Seller had such Former Employee of the Business not been
reinstated.

 


 

 

(r) Nothing contemplated by this _Section 5.06_  shall be construed as (i)
conferring upon any Person (including any Transferred Employee), other than
the parties hereto, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) establishing, or  constituting an
amendment, modification or termination of, or an undertaking to amend,
establish, modify or terminate, any compensation or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (iii) requiring Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to be  obligated to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee for
any period of time after the Closing Date, or (iv) altering or limiting the
rights of Seller and its Affiliates or Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Companies) to  terminate the employment of any Employee of the Business
or to amend, modify or terminate any compensation or employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement.

SECTION 5.07 _Tax Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) _Tax Returns; Payment of  Taxes_. Purchaser and Seller agree that:

 


 

 

(i) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required by applicable
Law to be filed on  or before the Closing Date, Seller shall (x) timely file,
or cause to be filed, such Tax Return with the relevant Taxing Authority and
(y) timely pay, or cause to be paid, to the relevant Taxing Authority the
amount shown as due on such Tax  Return. Each such Tax Return (other than a
Seller Consolidated Return or a Tax Return required to be included in (or
filed with) a Seller Consolidated Return) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise  required by applicable
Law. Seller shall also prepare and file all Tax Returns for the Companies that
are required to be included in (or filed with) a Seller Consolidated Return.

 


 

 

(ii) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required by applicable
Law to be filed  after the Closing Date (other than a Seller Consolidated
Return), Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, such Tax Return in a
manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. Seller shall (A)  deliver such Tax Returns to Purchaser (I)
at least 30 calendar days prior to the due date of such Tax Return (accounting
for any applicable extensions) in the case of a Tax Return relating to income
Taxes and (II) within a reasonable period of  time (and in any event no later
than five calendar days) before such Tax Return is due in the case of a Tax
Return relating to Taxes other than income Taxes, and (B) consider in good
faith any comments of Purchaser with respect to any such Tax  Return (other
than a Tax Return required to be included in (or filed with) a Seller
Consolidated Return). Purchaser shall timely file, or cause to be filed, a Tax
Return delivered in accordance with this _Section 5.07(a)(ii)_ with the
relevant Taxing Authority; _provided_ that Purchaser shall file such Tax
Return in  substantially the same form as that delivered by the Seller, after
Seller has reflected any comments of Purchaser that Seller agrees with in good
faith. Seller shall, no later than five calendar days before any payment with
respect to such Tax  Return is due, remit to Purchaser any Taxes shown as due
on such Tax Returns, and Purchaser shall timely pay, or cause to be paid, to
the relevant Taxing Authority the amount shown as due on such Tax Return.

 


 

 

(iii) In the case of any Straddle Period Tax Return (other than a Seller
Consolidated Return),  Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, such
Tax Return and deliver to Seller for review and comment (A) at least 30
calendar days prior to the due date of such Tax Return (accounting for any
applicable extensions) in the case of a  Tax Return relating to income Taxes
and (B) within a reasonable period of time (and in any event no later than
five calendar days) before such Tax Return is due in the case of a Tax Return
relating to Taxes other than income Taxes, and Seller  shall thereafter, and
in any event, no later than five calendar days (or, if such date is within
five calendar days of Purchaser's delivery of such Tax Return, as promptly as
practicable thereafter) before any payment

 


 

 


 

 

  57

 

 

 


 

  
   

with respect to such Tax Return is due, remit to Purchaser any Taxes shown on
such Tax Returns that are  attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. If
Seller disputes any item on a Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
it shall notify Purchaser of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for
its objection. Purchaser and Seller shall  negotiate in good faith to resolve
any such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is
required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the
item in question shall timely (whether before or after filing  of the
relevant Tax Return) be referred to, and resolved by, the Independent Expert
in accordance with the procedures and rules set forth in Section 1.04(c)-(f),
applied mutatis mutandis. Until such disputed item is resolved by the
Independent  Expert, Purchaser shall not file the relevant Tax Return without
Seller's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, and the relevant Tax Return shall thereafter be adjusted (or
amended, if previously filed)  to reflect its resolution and filed by
Purchaser accordingly.

 


 

 

(iv) Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Company to, (A)
amend, re-file or  otherwise modify any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or any Straddle Period Tax Return, (B) make or change any Tax election
in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period, (C) take any
action outside the ordinary  course of business on the Closing Date after the
Closing or (D) extend any applicable statute of limitations with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Return (other than any such extension that is agreed to in the
context of a Tax Proceeding in  accordance with _Section 8.08_ ), in each
case without Seller's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, to the extent such action  would have the effect of
increasing Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Return or the pre-closing
portion of any Straddle Tax Period Return.

 


 

 

(b) _Cooperation_.   Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors
and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing Tax
Returns of any Company, including by  maintaining and making available to
each other any records reasonably necessary in connection with any Tax Return
of any Company or any Tax dispute or audit relating to Taxes of any Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,  Seller shall not be
required to provide Purchaser with a copy of, or otherwise disclose the
contents of, any Seller Consolidated Return. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Companies to, (i) retain until 60 calendar days after the expiration  of
the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any applicable
extensions) all accounting and Tax records relating to any Tax Return of a
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) allow Seller and its Affiliates,
agents and  representatives, at Seller's expense and at times and dates
mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such
Pre-Closing Tax Period records and information as Seller may reasonably deem
necessary or appropriate  from time to time.

 


 

 

(c) _Refunds and Credits_.        Purchaser and Seller agree that any
refund or credit of Taxes of any Company (x) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(other than any such refund or credit that results from the carryback of
losses, credits or similar items of a Company

 


 

 


 

 

  58

 

 

 


 

  
   

from a Post-Closing Tax Period) shall be for the account of Seller and (y) for
any Post-Closing Tax  Period (including such refunds or credits as are
described in the parenthetical to clause (x)) shall be for the account of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall, if Seller so reasonably requests and at Seller's
expense, file for and obtain, or cause the  Companies to file for and obtain,
any refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under this _Section
5.07(c)_. Except as provided in the immediately  preceding sentence, (A)
Purchaser shall not file for and obtain, or cause the Companies to file for
and obtain, any refunds or credits solely with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (other than a Straddle Period) and (B) Purchaser shall not  file for
and obtain, or cause the Companies to file for and obtain, any refunds or
credits with respect to a Straddle Period without the consent of the Seller,
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that
Seller's consent shall be deemed to not be unreasonably withheld if Seller
reasonably believes that a claim for a refund or a credit would likely trigger
the initiation  of an audit by the relevant Taxing Authority. If a party or
any of its Affiliates receives any refund or credit of Taxes to which the
other party is entitled under this _Section 5.07(c)_,  such party shall pay
to the other party the amount of any such refund within 10 calendar days of
receipt of the refund or the amount of any such credit within 10 calendar days
after the credit is allowed or applied against such party's Tax  liability,
net of any costs or expenses (including Tax costs) imposed with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any portion of such refund or credit
is subsequently disallowed by any Taxing Authority, then amounts previously
paid pursuant to this _Section 5.07(c)_ in respect thereof shall be promptly
reimbursed by the payee party to the payor party.

 


 

 

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_.        Seller shall cause all Tax sharing
or indemnification agreements (other than agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business the primary purpose of which is not the allocation
or sharing of Taxes) (such agreements, " _Tax Sharing Agreements_ ") between
or among Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Company), on the
one hand, and any Company, on the other hand, to terminate on  or before the
Closing Date.

 


 

 

(e) _Tax Certificates_.  At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Purchaser the applicable certificates of non-foreign status
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser,  duly completed and executed and dated
not more than 30 calendar days prior to the Closing Date.

 


 

 

(f) _Purchase Price Allocation_.        Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a schedule allocating the Purchase Price (and any other
amounts treated as paid in consideration for the Companies for applicable Tax
purposes) (x) to each Company and (y) for each Company, among  its assets
(collectively, the " _Purchase Price Allocations_ ") within 90 calendar days
after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
_Section 5.07(f)_ , the term Purchase Price as used herein shall take into
account any adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section
1.04_ , which adjustments shall be incorporated into the Purchase Price
Allocations when finalized in accordance with the terms thereof. The Purchase
Price Allocations shall be prepared in  good faith in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder or applicable state
Tax Law. Seller shall have the right to review and raise any objections in

 


 

 


 

 

  59

 

 

 

 


 

 


 

 

writing to the Purchase Price Allocations during the 30 calendar-day period
after receipt thereof. If  Seller does not raise any objections within such
30 calendar-day period, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to Purchaser's
Purchase Price Allocations and such Purchase Price Allocations shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the  parties. If Seller raises an objection in
writing within such 30 calendar-day period, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the
dispute within 30 calendar days after the  commencement of such negotiations,
then the Independent Expert shall be engaged to review the Purchase Price
Allocations and to finally resolve all disputes. The determination of the
Independent Expert regarding the Purchase Price Allocations  shall be
delivered as soon as practicable following engagement of the Independent
Expert, but in no event more than 60 calendar days thereafter, and shall,
absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon Seller and
Purchaser. The  cost of the Independent Expert shall be shared in accordance
with the terms of _Section 1.04(f)_. Purchaser and Seller agree to (x) be
bound by the Purchase  Price Allocations determined to be final by this
_Section 5.07(f)_ (the " _Final  Purchase Price Allocations_ "), (y) act in
accordance with the Final Purchase Price Allocations in the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns and (z) take no position inconsistent with the Final
Purchase Price Allocations for  all Tax purposes (unless and to the extent
required to do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a)
of the Code or any similar U.S. state or local Tax provision)). The parties
shall, in good faith, make adjustments to the  Final Purchase Price
Allocations as necessary to account for any subsequent adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ or _Article VIII_
(Indemnification). In the event that any Taxing  Authority disputes the Final
Purchase Price Allocations, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the other parties in writing of the nature of such dispute.

 


 

 

(g) _Tax Treatment of Payments_.        Any payment made under this
_Section 5.07_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

 


 

 

(h) _Survival_. The  covenants and agreements contained in this _Section
5.07_ shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.08 _Transfer Taxes_. All  sums payable under this Agreement are
exclusive of Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes imposed or levied by reason
of, in connection with or attributable to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated  hereby or thereby
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the transactions described in
paragraph 1(e) of the Reorganization Plan) shall be borne fifty percent (50%)
by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Seller to the extent that such 
Transfer Taxes in the aggregate equal an amount that is not more than
$6,000,000. Transfer Taxes described in the immediately preceding sentence in
excess of $6,000,000 shall, to the extent of such excess, be borne one hundred
percent (100%)  by Seller. Seller and Purchaser further agree, upon request,
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Taxing Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such Transfer  Taxes. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate to prepare and timely file any Tax Returns relating to such Transfer
Taxes. If either Seller or Purchaser receives any refund, credit or recovery
of any Transfer Tax that was shared by the  parties in accordance with this
_Section 5.08_ ,

 


 

 


 

  60

 

  
   


 

 

such party shall promptly pay to the other party such other party's share of
such refund, credit or recovery, net of any  reasonable third party out-of-
pocket costs and expenses.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.09 _Publicity_. No press  release or other public announcement
concerning the Transactions shall be issued by a party or such party's
Affiliates without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),  except as such press
release or public announcement may be required by applicable Law, Judgment or
any Governmental Entity, in which case the party required to make the press
release or public announcement shall allow the other party reasonable  time
to comment thereon in advance of such issuance. The parties agree that any
press releases to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions shall be in the form, of
substance  and with timing agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser (the "
_Announcements_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) this _Section 5.09_
shall not apply to any press release or other public announcement made by any
of the parties hereto which is consistent with the Announcements and the terms
of this Agreement and does not contain any  information relating to Seller,
Purchaser, the Companies or the Business that has not been previously
announced or made public in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
(b) each of Seller and Purchaser may make internal announcements  to their
respective employees that are consistent with the parties' prior public
disclosures regarding the Transactions. The provisions of this _Section 5.09_
shall  not apply to communications by any party to its counsel, accountants,
prospective Lender Related Parties (including communications with respect to
communications made in connection with Purchaser's financing efforts), other
professional  advisors, its limited partners and investors or its prospective
limited partners and investors, in each case who are subject to customary
confidentiality obligations.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.10 _Intellectual Property Matters_.        (a) Except as
expressly provided in this _Section 5.10_ or in any other Transaction
Agreement, no right, title or interest to or under the Names or the Seller IP
is  being transferred or licensed by this Agreement, either expressly, by
implication, estoppel or otherwise.

 

 


 

 

(b) To the extent Seller has the necessary rights, without violating any law,
regulation, or court order, or  the terms of any agreement with another
Person, and without obligating Seller to make any payment or provide other
consideration to another Person, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date (other than the Companies)  hereby grants
to Purchaser and the Companies (the " _Purchaser IP Parties_ ") a perpetual,
irrevocable, non-terminable, royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive,  non-
transferable (except as provided in this _Section 5.10(b)_) and non-
sublicensable (except as provided in this _Section 5.10(b)_) license under the
Seller IP to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold, import,
export, distribute, reproduce, prepare derivative works, publicly display,
publicly perform, lease,  transfer, dispose of, commercialize, service,
maintain, repair and otherwise exploit any products or services of the
Purchaser IP Parties within the field of the Business. Transfer of any Seller
IP by Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be  made subject to the license
grant in this _Section 5.10(b)_. Purchaser may transfer the license provided
in this _Section 5.10(b)_, in whole or in part, to the acquirer of the part of
the Business to which the license relates.The parties hereto intend and agree
that, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (and  any
amendment thereto) and any equivalent Law in any foreign jurisdiction, the
license in this

 


 

 


 

  61

 

 


 

 


 

 

_Section 5.10(b)_ will be  treated as a license to intellectual property (as
defined in Section 101(35A) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code).

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Companies),  acknowledges and agrees that as between the parties hereto,
Seller or its Subsidiaries have the exclusive right to use and display any and
all of the Names and except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section
5.10_ or in any other Transaction Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) shall, as of the
Closing, have any rights in or to  the Names, including to use the Names in
any manner, or to register or seek to register, or to permit, cause or assist
any third party to register or to seek to register, any of the Names or any
marks confusingly similar to any of the Names  in any jurisdiction.

 


 

 

(d) With respect to the Names:

 


 

 

(i) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 5.10(d)_ , Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Companies)
to, as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than one hundred twenty
(120) calendar days after the  Closing, (A) cease and discontinue any and all
uses of the Names, (B) delete or destroy any and all materials under their
control that contain the Names and (C) cause each Company to, as applicable,
change its corporate or company name, seals  and certificates to remove any
references to the Names and file as promptly as practicable in each
jurisdiction in which each Company is qualified to do business all documents
necessary to reflect such change of name or to terminate its  qualification
in such jurisdiction under such name. Subject to this _Section 5.10(d)_ , in
the event Seller identifies any non-compliance with this _Section 5.10(d)(i)_
, Seller will provide written notice of such non-compliance to Purchaser and
Purchaser shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days to cure such  non-
compliance. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing obligations shall not
require Purchaser to cease and discontinue use of or delete or destroy
materials to the extent such actions are not reasonably practicable (e.g.,
manhole covers).

 


 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Companies shall, for a period of six
(6) months after  the Closing (the " _Transition Period_ "), be entitled to
use the Names in the same manner as such Names were used in the Business as of
the Closing; _provided_ , that Purchaser may sell or distribute in the
ordinary course of business any inventory that exists as of the Closing until
the exhaustion of such inventory; _provided_ , _further_ , that beginning
immediately following the Closing, Purchaser shall ensure  that any use of
the Names in connection with the Business displays (A) the New Name together
with the applicable Name and appearing in more prominent fashion than such
Name, (B) an accompanying statement identifying the New Name as the name  of
the business formerly known by the applicable Name and (C) all materials
containing the New Name together with any Name are destroyed prior to the end
of the Transition Period. Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
mail,  distribute, display or otherwise provide the co-branded materials
described in the foregoing proviso as reasonably directed by

 


 

 


 

  62

 

 


 

 


 

 

Purchaser for a period of sixty (60) calendar days prior to the Closing.
Subject to the name usage  rights provided for in this _Section 5.10_ , as of
and following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Companies) to,  cease to, and not at any time thereafter, hold
themselves out as having any affiliation or association with Seller or any of
its Affiliates.

 


 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall be in  breach of this _Section 5.10(d)_ if, after the
Closing, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (A) uses the Names in a nominative
manner in textual sentences referencing  the historical relationship between
Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Companies, on the other
hand, which references are factually accurate, (B) retains copies of any
books, records or other similar internally-focused  materials that, as of the
Closing, contain or display the Names and such copies are used solely for
internal or archival purposes (and not public display), (C) uses the Names in
internal tax, legal, employment or similar records, (D) uses  equipment and
other similar articles of the Business as of the Closing, notwithstanding that
they may bear one or more of the Names (provided that it is not reasonably
practicable to remove or cover the applicable Names after Purchaser's use  of
reasonable efforts to do so), (E) uses tools, drawings, manuals, work sheets,
operating procedures, other written or electronic data, materials or assets
(including computer source code) for internal purposes only in connection with
the  Business, notwithstanding that they may bear one or more of the Names or
(F) uses the Names to comply with applicable Laws or for litigation,
regulatory or corporate filings and documents filed by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates with any  Governmental Entity. Further, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates shall be in breach of this Section 5.10(d) by reason of (x)
the appearance of the Names in or on any publications, marketing materials,
brochures, instruction sheets,  equipment or products that were distributed
in the ordinary course of business prior to the Closing or (y) the sale by
distributors unaffiliated with Purchaser of inventory containing any Name that
is held by such distributor as of the date  that is up to six months
following the Closing.

 


 

 

(e) Any and all goodwill arising in connection with the use of the Names by
Purchaser or its  Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies),
shall inure solely to the benefit of Seller.

 


 

 

(f) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Companies)  shall contest the use, ownership or validity of any rights of
Seller or its Subsidiaries in or to the Names or (to the extent not a
Transferred Asset) the Seller IP that exists as of the Closing.

 


 

 

(g) (i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to
cause to be obtained,  any Consent, approval or amendment required for the
assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Verizon IP
Rights (for the avoidance of doubt, as in effect on the date hereof) to
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates as  promptly as practicable following the
date hereof and (ii) to the extent Seller seeks an extension of the applicable
term of any Verizon IP Agreement for use in connection with the operation of

 


 

 


 

  63

 

 


 

 


 

 

the Seller Business, Seller will provide written notice of such decision to
Purchaser, and at the  request of Purchaser, Seller shall also use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a corresponding extension of the
applicable term related to the applicable Verizon IP Rights (other than the
Verizon IP Rights granted pursuant to the  Trademark License Agreement) for
use by Purchaser in connection with the operation of the Business; _provided_
that Seller shall not be obligated to pay any  consideration or grant any
concession to Verizon or any other party in order to obtain any extension of
Purchaser's right to use the applicable Verizon IP Rights in connection with
the operation of the Business, and Purchaser shall be  responsible for making
any such payment or concession to Verizon.

 


 

 

(h) If Seller is not granted (or elects not to pursue) an extension to the
Verizon IP  Agreements as described in _Section 5.10(g)_ , and implements any
workarounds, modifications or adjustments to its video delivery system to
ensure the same features,  functionality and quality for such video delivery
system or otherwise without the use of the Verizon IP Rights (other than the
Verizon IP Rights granted pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement) (the "
_System Workarounds_ "), Seller shall cause the System Workarounds to be made
available to Purchaser and its Affiliates' systems, including by granting
Purchaser and its Affiliates a  non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-
terminable, royalty-free, worldwide, transferable and sublicensable license to
use any Software (including source code) and other Intellectual Property owned
by Seller or any of its Affiliates and  used in the System Workarounds;
_provided_ that (i) Purchaser has not altered the operation of its Systems in
a manner that would materially and adversely affect  Seller's ability to make
the System Workarounds available to Purchaser in accordance with this _Section
5.10(h)_ , (ii) to the extent necessary, Purchaser shall  secure, at its own
cost, its own licenses to any third party Software used in the System
Workarounds, (iii) Purchaser shall pay any third party costs necessary to
harmonize any Software developed or used by Seller in the Systems Workaround
to  Purchaser's systems and (iv) Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any
reasonable and documented actual incremental costs and expenses incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with making the Systems
Workaround available to  Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.10(h)_.

Companies to, retain,  for at least seven years after the Closing Date, all
books, records and other documents pertaining to the Business that are

Indemnitee, their heirs and their personal representatives and shall be

costs and expenses related  to such Business Claims), Seller shall, and shall
cause the other members of the Seller Group to, (1) reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser (upon Purchaser's reasonable request) in submitting Business Claims
(or pursuing claims previously made)  on behalf of Purchaser or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, under any Seller Insurance Policy and (2) not
relinquish any of its rights, or take any actions (other than the making of
claims under the Seller Insurance Policies) that could  reasonably be
expected to reduce or otherwise limit the available coverage for any Business
Claims under any of the Seller Insurance Policies; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (A) none of Seller or any other
member of the Seller Group shall be responsible for any Losses that are 
"self-insured" by Seller or any other member of the Seller Group as of
immediately prior to the Closing, that are within any applicable deductible or
retention amounts under any Seller Insurance Policy, (B) none of Seller or any
other member  of the Seller Group shall be liable to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Companies) for any Losses or
other amounts hereunder if any insurance company that has issued any Seller
Insurance Policy fails to  pay such losses or amounts as a result of, or in
connection with, the filing or declaration of, or institution of proceeding
for, any type of bankruptcy (whether voluntary or involuntary), insolvency or
the commencement of any similar action  or proceeding or otherwise, and (C)
the Seller Group may, at any time after the Closing, without liability or
obligation to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, including, after the Closing, the
Companies, amend, commute, terminate, buy-out,  extinguish liability under or
otherwise modify any Seller Insurance Policy, in each case, solely with
respect to the period following the Closing. Nothing in this _Section 
5.14(a)_ shall relieve Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after
the Closing, the

 


 

 


 

 

  66

 

 

 


 

  
   

Companies) from any obligations with respect to the Assumed Liabilities or any
other Losses.

 


 

 

(b) The parties agree that, except as set forth in _Section 5.14(a)_ , from
and after the Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance policies related
to the Business and arranged or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates is only
for the benefit of Seller  and its Affiliates (other than the Companies), and
not for the benefit of Purchaser or the Business, and Purchaser agrees to
arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business and,
without prejudice to any right of  indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of
Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies which may provide coverage for
claims relating in any way to the Business.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.15 _Settlement of Intercompany  Indebtedness_. Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall cause all intercompany indebtedness, accounts and
balances between and among any Company, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other  hand, to be eliminated
(which may include the netting of receivables and payables, contributions to
equity and dividends) without any liability to Purchaser, or after the
Closing, the Companies.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.16 _Confidentiality_.   (a) From and after the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives to, keep strictly
confidential and not disclose to any other Person, or use  for their own
benefit or the benefit of any other Person, any Business Confidential
Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may disclose, or may permit
disclosure of, Business Confidential Information (i) to its or its Affiliates'
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives who have
a need to  know such information for purposes of fulfilling their obligations
hereunder or under another Transaction Agreement and are informed of their
obligation to hold such information confidential to the same extent as is
applicable to Seller and  in respect of whose failure to comply with such
obligations, Seller will be responsible, (ii) if Seller, its Affiliates or
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives are
requested or compelled to disclose any  such Business Confidential
Information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
applicable Law or (iii) in connection with any Proceeding to enforce such
Party's rights under this Agreement or any Transaction  Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Business Confidential
Information is requested, compelled or required to be disclosed pursuant to
clause (ii) above, Seller shall (x) to the extent legally permissible and 
reasonably practicable, promptly notify Purchaser of the existence of such
request or requirement and the disclosure that is expected to be made in
respect thereto in each case with sufficient specificity so that Purchaser
may, at its  expense, seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.16_ and (y) if
requested by Purchaser (at  Purchaser's sole cost and expense), assist Seller
in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy with respect to such
request or requirement. If such a protective order or other remedy or the
receipt of a waiver by Purchaser is  not obtained and Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives is nonetheless required by such judicial or administrative
process or applicable Law to disclose any Business  Confidential Information,
Seller (or such Affiliate or officer, director, employee, agent or
representative) may, after compliance with the immediately

 


 

 


 

 

  67

 

 

 


 

  
   

preceding sentence of this _Section 5.16_,  disclose only that portion of the
Business Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and, if appropriate, such Affiliate or
such officer, director, employee, agent or representative, exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the  confidentiality of such
Business Confidential Information, including by obtaining reasonable
assurances that confidential treatment shall be accorded any Business
Confidential Information so disclosed. Notwithstanding any disclosure of 
Business Confidential Information pursuant to clause (ii) above, Seller and
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives will continue to be bound by their obligations of
confidentiality  (including with respect to any Business Confidential
Information disclosed pursuant to clause (ii) above), non-disclosure,
restriction on use and other obligations under this _Section 5.16_.

 


 

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Business       Confidential
Information_ " means all non-public information included in the Transferred
Assets or otherwise used or held for use in or related to the Business, except
that "Business Confidential Information" shall not include  information which
(1) is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of
its disclosure in violation of _Section 5.16(a)_ above) or (2) after  the
Closing Date, is lawfully made available or known to Seller or its Affiliates
by a Person not subject to any duty of confidentiality to Purchaser or its
Affiliates or their representatives.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Seller shall be
deemed to have  satisfied its obligations hereunder with respect to Business
Confidential Information if it exercises the same degree of care (but no less
than a reasonable degree of care) as it takes to preserve confidentiality for
its own similar  information, materials or other documents.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.17 _Resignations_.   Seller shall cause to be delivered to
Purchaser on the Closing Date resignation letters of such members of the board
of directors (or comparable governing body) of each Company and officers of
each Company which have been requested in writing  by Purchaser at least
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, such resignation letters to be
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.18 _Financing_. (a)  Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts (taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things  necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject only to the
conditions (including the market flex provisions) set forth in the Financing
Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to  (i) maintain in effect
and comply with the Financing Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and subject
only to the conditions (including the market flex provisions) set forth  in
the Financing Letters (or on terms not materially less favorable to Purchaser
than the terms and conditions (including market flex provisions) set forth in
the Financing Letters), (iii) satisfy (and cause its Affiliates to satisfy)
(or, if  deemed advisable by Purchaser, seek the waiver of) on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Purchaser and its Affiliates in the Financing
Letters and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, (iv)
consummate the Financing at  or prior to the Closing, including using its
(and causing its Affiliates to use)

 


 

 

 

 


 

  68

 

 


 

  
   

reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the other Persons committing
to fund the Financing to fund the Financing  at the Closing, (v) enforce its
rights and remedies under the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing and (vi) comply with its covenants and other
obligations under the Financing Letters and the definitive  agreements
relating to the Financing. Purchaser shall not, without the prior written
consent of Seller, agree to or permit any termination of or amendment or
modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the 
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if
such termination, amendment, modification or waiver would (A) reduce (or could
have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including
by  increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) to
an amount below the Required Amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of  the conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any other provision of the Financing Letters in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the
funding of the Financing (or  satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date or (C) adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to enforce its rights and remedies against any other party to any
Financing Letter or the definitive agreements relating to  the Financing.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any amendment,
modification or waiver to or under any Financing Letter or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing. Purchaser will fully pay, or cause to
be  paid, all commitment and other fees under or arising pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter as and when they become due.

 


 

 

(b) Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a reasonable basis and in
reasonable detail of the  status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing. Purchaser shall give Seller prompt written notice of (i) any actual
or potential material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to any Financing Letter or definitive  documents related to the Financing of
which Purchaser becomes aware, (ii) the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Financing source with respect to any (A) actual
or potential material breach, default,  termination or repudiation by any
party to any Financing Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or  disagreement
between or among any parties to any Financing Letter or any definitive
document related to the Financing and (iii) the occurrence of an event or
development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability
of  Purchaser to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by
the Financing Letters on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by any Financing Letter or the definitive documents
related to the  Financing (or if at any time for any other reason Purchaser
believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on the terms and conditions,
in the manner or from the sources  contemplated by any Financing Letter or
the definitive documents related to the Financing). As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two Business Days of the date Seller
delivers to Purchaser a written request, Purchaser  shall provide any
information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any 
applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
or if Purchaser becomes aware of any event or circumstance that could
reasonably

 


 

 


 

  69

 

 


 

 


 

 

be expected to make any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable on the terms
and conditions (including  any applicable market flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall (x) promptly
notify Seller in writing and (y) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain in replacement thereof, and negotiate and enter  into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources in
an amount sufficient, when taken together with the Equity Financing and the
available portion of the Debt Financing, to fund the Required Amount on 
terms and conditions (including market flex provisions) not materially less
favorable to Purchaser (or its Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence  of such event; _provided_ that the failure to obtain alternative
financing shall not relieve Purchaser of any obligations hereunder. Purchaser
shall deliver  to Seller complete copies of all Contracts or other
arrangements (including any Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing. For purposes of this  Agreement, (I) references to the "Financing"
shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted
to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 5.18_,  (II) references
to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to
be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 5.18_ and  (III) references
to the "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this
_Section 5.18_.

 


 

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use, and shall cause the Companies
to use,  reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause any attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or
representative (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ")       retained
by Seller or any Company to provide, in each case at Purchaser's sole cost and
expense, such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist it in 
causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied or as is
otherwise reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing, including:

drafting sessions, rating agency presentations, road shows, and due diligence
sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with
prospective lenders, investors and  ratings agencies, in each case upon
reasonable advance notice and at mutually agreeable dates, times and
locations, and reasonably assisting Purchaser in obtaining ratings as
contemplated by the Debt Financing;

 


 

 

(ii) reasonably assisting Purchaser and the Lenders (or their respective
appropriate  affiliates) in the preparation of (A) offering documents,

Debt Financing, including the execution and delivery of customary
authorization letters in connection  with bank information memoranda and
including customary representations to the lenders contemplated by the Debt

documents  (provided that neither Seller nor any Company or their
representatives shall be responsible in any manner for information relating to
the proposed debt and equity capitalization that is required for such pro
forma financial information or any cost savings or synergies);

 


 

 

(v) using reasonable best efforts to cause their independent auditors to (A)
provide,  consistent with customary practice, (x) customary auditors consents

for a private placement of non-convertible debt securities pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act and (y) reasonable assistance to Purchaser in
connection with Purchaser's  preparation of pro forma financial statements
and information and (B) attend a reasonable number of accounting diligence

documents (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any legal opinions) as
may be reasonably requested by  Purchaser and otherwise facilitating the
pledging of collateral and the granting of guarantees and security interests
in respect of the Debt Financing (including cooperation in connection with the
pay-off of existing Indebtedness to the  extent contemplated by this
Agreement and the release of related Liens and termination of related security
interests);

 


 

 

(vii) reasonably assisting Purchaser in obtaining waivers, consents, estoppels

and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent requested at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the  anticipated Closing Date.

 


 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
_Section 5.18(c)_ shall require any such cooperation or assistance to the
extent that it could result in Seller or any Company being required to (1)
pledge any assets as  collateral other than by any Company at or after
Closing, (2) agree to pay any commitment or other similar fee, bear any cost
or expense that is not reimbursed by Purchaser, incur any other liability or
give any indemnities to any third party  or otherwise commit to take any
similar action in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing, (3)
take any actions to the extent such actions would, in Seller's reasonable
judgment, (A) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing  business or operations
of Seller or the Companies or otherwise interfere with the prompt and timely
discharge by Seller's or any Company's employees of their normal duties, (B)
subject any director, manager, officer or employee of Seller or  any Company
or their Affiliates to any actual or potential personal liability, (C)
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or

contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (6) provide access  to or
disclose information that Seller reasonably determines would jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege of, or conflict with any confidentiality
requirements applicable to, Seller, the Companies or their Affiliates (it
being understood  that Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or disclose such
information in a manner that does not jeopardize such attorney-client
privilege or conflict with such  confidentiality requirements) or (7) cause

are not contingent on the  Closing or would be effective prior to the
Closing.

 


 

 

(d) Purchaser shall be responsible for all fees and expenses related to the
Financing  contemplated hereby. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in _Section 5.05_ (Expenses), Purchaser shall, either at the Closing

accordance with _Section 7.01_  (Termination), reimburse Seller and each of
its Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys'  fees) incurred by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Financing. Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and each Company and their respective Affiliates and all
of their respective directors, officers,  managers, employees and
Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information 
provided by Seller, any Company (prior to the Closing) and their respective
Affiliates and all of their respective directors, officers, managers,
employees and Representatives), except to the extent resulting from the bad
faith, gross  negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this
Agreement by Seller, any Company and their respective Affiliates and all of
their respective directors, officers, managers, employees and Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to  the contrary in this Agreement, no Company shall
have any liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related

(including the Financing or any alternative financing).

 


 

 

(f) Each of Seller and the Companies hereby consents to the customary use of
its and its  Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_
such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm,  disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Business or the
Companies or their reputation or goodwill.

 


 

 

(g) Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, use reasonable best
efforts to periodically  update any Required Information provided to
Purchaser as may be necessary so that such Required Information is (i)
Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition
of "Required Information" and (iii) would not,  after giving effect to such
update(s), result in the Marketing Period to cease pursuant to the definition

effectively access the financing markets, require the  cooperation of Seller
and the Companies under _Section 5.18(c)_ at any time, and from time to time
and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing  Date;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be
applicable as to each attempt to access the markets.

SECTION 5.19 _Notification_.   Seller shall give prompt notice to Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Seller, of (i) the breach or failure
to be true and correct of any representation or warranty made by it contained

rise to the failure of a condition in _Section 6.02(a)_ (Representations and
Warranties) or _Section 6.03(a)_ (Representations       and Warranties),
as applicable, or (ii) the failure by it to perform or comply with in any
material respect any obligation or covenant to be performed or complied with
by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements  of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; _provided_ f _urther_ ,  _however_ , that any failure by a party
to provide such notification shall not be deemed to result in a breach of any

pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(ii)_ (General  Indemnification by Seller) or
_Section 8.02(a)(ii)_ (General  Indemnification by Purchaser), as applicable

representation or warranty contained  in _Article II_ (Representations and
Warranties Relating to Seller, Intermediate  Holdco and the Transferred
Equity Interests), _Article III_ (Representations       and Warranties
Relating to the Companies) or _Article IV_ (Representations  and Warranties
of Purchaser)). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall be deemed not to be in breach of _Section 5.24(a)_   and

the  applicable Financial Statements on or prior to the date that is thirty
(30) calendar days after the date specified for required delivery thereof set
forth in _Section 5.24(a)_   and _5.24(b)(i)-(ii)_ and _(iv)_.

(collectively, with Seller and Intermediate Holdco, the " _Releasors_ "),
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, releases, discharges,  remises
and acquits Purchaser and each of its Affiliates and each of their respective
successors, assigns and past, present and future directors, managers, officers

in respect of capital stock or Equity  Interests of the Companies. Each of
Seller and Intermediate Holdco, for itself and the other Releasors, hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
claim or demand, or commencing, distributing or  causing to be commenced, any
Proceeding of any kind against any Releasees, based on any of the foregoing.
Each of Seller and Intermediate Holdco, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, expressly waives, to the full extent that it may  lawfully waive,
all rights pertaining to a general release of claims, and affirms that it is
releasing all known or unknown claims that it has or may have against any of
the Releasees in its capacity as a direct or indirect holder of any  shares

capital stock or other Equity Interests of any Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing  in this _Section 5.20_ or
any other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to waive, release,
discharge or otherwise affect the rights or obligations  of any Person or
preclude such Person from exercising, any of its rights under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to claims in regards to covenants or agreements contained in 
this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement that by their terms
contemplate performance thereof following the Closing or otherwise expressly
by their terms survive the Closing).

 


 

 

SECTION 5.21 _Replacement of Credit Support  Obligations_. (a) With respect
to any Credit Support Obligations set forth on _Section 5.21(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter pursuant to which  Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Companies) provide credit support to the Business or the Companies,
Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide replacement
guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds or  other assurances of payment,
and Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to obtain any necessary
release effective as of the Closing in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller with respect to all such Credit  Support
Obligations. If Purchaser has not obtained the complete and unconditional
release of Seller and its Affiliates from any such Credit Support Obligation
as of the Closing Date (each such Credit Support Obligation, until such time
as  such Credit Support Obligation is so released, a " _Seller Continuing
Credit Support Obligation_ "), then (i) Purchaser shall continue to use its
commercially reasonable  efforts to obtain promptly the complete and
unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from each Seller Continuing
Credit Support Obligation until the earlier of (A) the date that such release
is obtained and (B) the date that is six  months following the date hereof
and (ii) any demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Seller Continuing
Credit Support Obligation or any cash or other collateral required to be
posted in connection with or in the place of any Seller  Continuing Credit
Support Obligation and the carrying costs of any cash collateral, the fronting
fee costs, and any other out-of-pocket costs and expenses resulting from a
Seller Continuing Credit Support Obligation during such period (" _Assumed
Credit Support Obligations_ ") shall be deemed liabilities of Purchaser.

 


 

 

(b) With respect to any Credit Support Obligations set forth on _Section
5.21(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter pursuant to which the Companies
provide credit support to the Seller Business, Seller agrees to use

of credit, surety bonds or other assurances of payment, and Purchaser and
Seller shall reasonably cooperate to obtain any necessary release effective as
of the Closing in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to Purchaser
and Seller with respect to all such Credit Support Obligations. If Seller has
not obtained the complete and unconditional release of the Companies and their
Affiliates from any such Credit Support Obligation as of  the Closing Date
(each such Credit Support Obligation, until such time as such Credit Support
Obligation is so released, a " _Business Continuing Credit Support Obligation_
"),       then (i) Seller shall continue to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain promptly the complete and unconditional release
of the Companies from each Business Continuing Credit Support Obligation until
the earlier of (A) the date  that such release is obtained and (B) the date
that is six months following the date hereof and (ii) any demand or draw upon,
or withdrawal from, any Business Continuing Credit Support Obligation or any
cash or other collateral required to be  posted in connection with or in the

will use commercially reasonable efforts to  obtain within six months
following the Closing Date, from the counterparty to each Master Agreement any
Consent that is required to divide and/or partially assign the respective
rights and obligations under and in respect of any such Master  Agreement
such that, effective as of the Closing (or such later time such Consent from

Purchaser (including a Company) is the beneficiary of the rights and is 
responsible for the obligations related to the Purchaser Portion of such
Master Agreement and (ii) Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than a
Company) is the beneficiary of the rights and is responsible for the
obligations related to the  Seller Portion of such Master Agreement. If
Seller and Purchaser or their respective Affiliates are not able to enter into
an arrangement to divide and/or partially assign the rights and obligations
under and in respect of any Master  Agreement on or prior to the Closing,
Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in any lawful,

Master Agreement to the extent relating to the Business and (y) the date  on
which the division and/or partial assignment of such Master Agreement as
contemplated by this _Section 5.22_ is effected, Purchaser or an Affiliate of

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any applicable right to enforce such
Contract against the applicable counterparty thereto) and obligations of the
Purchaser Portion  under such Master Agreement and Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (other than a Company) shall receive the interests in the benefits and
the obligations of the Seller Portion under such Master Agreement.

the " _Pre-Closing Reorganization_ ") to occur. The agreements and instruments
to effectuate the Pre-Closing Reorganization shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable  to Purchaser. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, comply with the terms applicable to Seller and its Affiliates

based  Phase II Connect America support in respect of the Territory
referenced in the Public Notice and accepted by Seller in the letter dated as
of June 15, 2015, from Seller to the FCC, and (ii) from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall be  entitled to receive any associated support payments from
the FCC (any such payments, " _CAF II Support Payments_"); _provided_ that if
the Closing occurs in 2020, the monthly CAF II Support Payment in respect of
the calendar month in which the Closing occurs shall be allocated such that
(A) Seller shall receive an amount equal to  the total CAF II Support Payment
due for such month, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days elapsed from and including the first day of such month
through and including the day prior to the Closing  Date, and the denominator
of which is the total number of calendar days in such month, and (B) Purchaser
shall receive an amount equal to the total CAF II Support Payment due for such

respective Affiliates or a Company or its Affiliates by the FCC or another
Governmental Entity and any Losses suffered by Seller, Intermediate Holdco or

with Seller's OSP team with respect to Purchaser's design of, and plan for,

SECTION 5.29 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 


 

 

(a) Seller shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates to not), for a period of
three years after  the Closing (the " _Restricted Period_ "), own, manage,
participate or engage, directly or indirectly (whether as principal, agent,
distributor, representative,  stockholder or otherwise), in, any facilities-
based operations that directly compete with the Business in the Territory (any
such business, a " _Competitive Business_ ").        Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.29(a)_ shall not
prohibit or restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates from (i) engaging  in
any transaction or series of related transactions with any Person or business
that results in Seller acquiring, or being acquired by, such other Person or
business, or any other combination of Seller with such other Person or
business (in  each case, whether by way of merger, consolidation or
otherwise); _provided_ that, at the time of entering such transaction, no more
than fifty percent (50%) of the  gross revenues of such other Person (and its
Affiliates) or business are derived from a Competitive Business; (ii) selling
all or substantially all of the assets of Seller and its Subsidiaries (taken
as a whole); (iii) acquiring or investing  in any equity interest in any
Person by any bona fide employee benefit plan of Seller or its Affiliates; or
(iv) performing any of its obligations under any of the Transaction
Agreements.

 


 

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates not to),  whether directly or indirectly, whether for itself or
for or on behalf of any of its Affiliates, solicit (or permit to be directly
or indirectly solicited) or employ or otherwise seek to employ any Transferred
Employee, in each case, whether  as an employee or consultant; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing restrictions on  solicitation shall not
preclude (i) any generalized searches by use of advertising or recruiting
efforts (including the use of search firms) which are not specifically
targeted at Purchaser or any of its

 


 

 


 

 

  79

 

 

 


 

  
   

Affiliates or a Transferred Employee (including any Company after the Closing)
and that are not  specifically targeted at employees in the Territory (it
being understood that a solicitation that targets states both within the
Territory and outside of the Territory shall not be prohibited by this
_Section 5.29(b))_ or (ii) the hiring of any Transferred Employee who (A) was
terminated without cause by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Companies) at least six (6)  months prior to commencement of employment
discussions between Seller or its Affiliates and such Person or (B) responds
to any generalized search or recruiting efforts described in clause (i) above.

 


 

 

(c) During the Restricted Period, Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates not to),  whether directly or indirectly, whether for itself or
for or on behalf of any of its Affiliates, solicit (or permit to be directly
or indirectly solicited) or employ or otherwise seek to employ any Transition
Team Member or other Retained  Employee, in each case, whether as an employee
or consultant; _provided_ , _however_ , that  the foregoing restrictions on
solicitation shall not preclude (i) any generalized searches by use of
advertising or recruiting efforts (including the use of search firms) which
are not specifically targeted at Seller or any of its Affiliates  (including,
prior to the Closing, the Companies) or (ii) the hiring of any Transition Team
Member or other Retained Employee who (A) was terminated without cause by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the 
Companies) at least six (6) months prior to commencement of employment
discussions between Purchaser or its Affiliates and such Person or (B)
responds to any generalized search or recruiting efforts described in clause
(i) above.

 


 

 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this
_Section 5.29_ are reasonable in scope and duration, and it is the desire and
intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this _Section 5.29_ be
enforced to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law. If any
provision of this _Section 5.29_   is held to be excessively broad as to
duration, scope, activity or subject, such provision will be construed by
limiting and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permissible under applicable Law.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.30 _Wrong Pocket_. If  and to the extent that it is determined at
any time after Closing that (x) legal title to or beneficial or other interest
in all or part of any of the Excluded Assets (as defined in the Reorganization
Plan) has been transferred to Purchaser  or its Subsidiaries (including the
Companies), or (y) legal title to or beneficial or other interest in and all
or part of any Transferred Asset has not been transferred to Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries (including the Companies), including  any Restricted Asset (as
defined in the Reorganization Plan) (each of (x) and (y), a " _Misplaced
Asset_ "), Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall (and shall cause  their
respective Affiliates, as applicable, to) promptly upon the request of the
other party: (a) execute all such agreements, deeds or other documents as may
be necessary for the purposes of transferring, assigning and conveying such 
Misplaced Assets (or part thereof) or the relevant interests in them to the
other party of nominal consideration, (b) obtain all Consents from Persons
necessary or appropriate for the purposes of transferring, assigning, and
conveying such  Misplaced Assets (or part thereof) or the relevant interests
in them to the other party, (c) complete all such further acts or things as
the other party may reasonably direct in order to transfer, assign, and convey
such Misplaced Assets (or  parts thereof) or the relevant interests in them
to the other party and (d) hold such Misplaced Assets (or part thereof), or
relevant interest

 


 

 


 

  80

 

 


 

  
   

in such Misplaced Assets, in trust for the other party (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) until such time as the  transfer is validly
effected to vest the asset (or part thereof) or relevant interest in the
Misplaced Asset to the other party. Seller shall retain and continue to fully
satisfy in the ordinary course of business consistent with past  practice all
Excluded Liabilities. Pending the earlier of the transfer pursuant to this
_Section 5.30_ and three years from the Closing Date, Seller and  Purchaser
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable
best efforts to cooperate (each at its own expense) in any lawful,
contractually permissible and commercially reasonable arrangement designed to
(i) provide  to Purchaser all economic benefits and burdens of any Misplaced
Assets (whether tangible or intangible) constituting Transferred Assets that
have not been transferred to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including the
Companies) and (ii) provide  to Seller all economic benefits and burdens of
any of the Misplaced Assets (whether tangible or intangible) constituting
Excluded Assets that have been transferred to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries
(including the Companies). During such time  period, each party and its
Affiliates shall comply with all applicable covenants and obligations with
respect to any such Misplaced Assets held by it, including the payment of any
costs and expenses in connection therewith, which shall be  performed by such
party or its applicable Affiliate for the other party's account and such other
party shall promptly reimburse such party for any such out-of-pocket costs,
expenses or payments. In addition and without limiting the  foregoing, if
following the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies),
on the one hand, and the Seller Group, on the other hand, shall receive or
otherwise possess any asset or be liable for any Liability that is  allocated
to the other group of Persons pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, Purchaser
and its Affiliates and the Seller Group, as applicable, shall promptly
transfer or assign, or cause to be transferred or assigned, for no
additional  consideration, such asset or Liability to the group of Persons so
entitled thereto or responsible therefor, and such group shall accept such
asset or assume such Liability. Prior to any such transfer, the group of
Persons possessing any such  asset shall hold such asset in trust for such
other group of Persons.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.31 _Pre-Closing Capital  Expenditure Requests_. Following the date
hereof and prior to the Closing, and solely to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, as soon as reasonably practicable following any reasonable
written request from Purchaser, Seller  shall (or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to) make such capital expenditures within the Territory that are
reasonably requested by Purchaser to the extent not unreasonably disruptive of
the business of Seller and its Affiliates; _provided_ that Seller shall not be
required to make any such capital expenditures unless such capital
expenditures have been fully funded by Purchaser at or prior to the  time of
such expenditure. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will
Seller have any obligation to reimburse Purchaser for any amounts paid by
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.31_ , regardless of whether the Closing
occurs.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.32 _Pre-Closing Reports_.        Following the date hereof and
prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (a) in each case
solely to the extent such reports, memoranda or other materials are otherwise
prepared by Seller or any of its Affiliates in the ordinary  course of
business, copies of any material management reports, memoranda or similar
materials regarding the Business promptly following the preparation of any
such report, memorandum or similar material, (b) promptly following the end of
each  fiscal quarter of Seller, a report setting forth the subscribers of the
Business as of the end of such quarter (each, a " _Quarterly Subscriber
Report_ ") and (c)  promptly following the end of each calendar month that

 


 

 


 

 

  81

 

 

 


 

  
   

is not a fiscal quarter end, a report setting forth the subscribers of the
Business as of the end of such month.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.33 _Transition Services Agreement_.        From and after the
date hereof, each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) comply with the provisions applicable to such
parties set forth in _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the " _Transition Services
Agreement_ ").

 


 

 

SECTION 5.34 _Privileged Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) Each party hereto acknowledges that: (i) each party and its Affiliates has
or may obtain  Privileged Information; (ii) there are or may be a number of
Shared Proceedings affecting both of Purchaser and Seller; (iii) both
Purchaser and Seller have a common legal interest in Shared Proceedings, in
the Privileged Information and in  the preservation of the confidential
status of the Privileged Information, in each case relating to the Business;
and (iv) both Purchaser and Seller intend that the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements and  any transfer of
Privileged Information in connection therewith shall not operate as a waiver
of any potentially applicable privilege.

 


 

 

(b) Following the Closing, each of Purchaser and Seller agrees, on behalf of
itself and each of  its Subsidiaries, not to disclose or otherwise waive any
privilege attaching to any Privileged Information relating to the Business
without providing prompt written notice to and obtaining the prior written
consent of the other, which consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed and shall not be withheld, conditioned or delayed if
the other party certifies that such disclosure is to be made in response to a
likely threat of suspension or debarment or similar  action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to give any such  notice or
obtain any such consent and may make such disclosure or waiver with respect to
Privileged Information if such Privileged Information relates solely to the
Business (unless such information relates to matters for which Seller may 
have indemnification obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement). In the event of a disagreement concerning the reasonableness of
withholding such consent, no disclosure shall be made prior to a resolution of
such  disagreement by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the
limitations in this sentence shall not apply in the case of disclosure
required by Law and so certified as provided in the first sentence of this
paragraph.

 


 

 

(c) After the Closing, upon receipt of any subpoena or other compulsory
disclosure notice from  a Governmental Entity or otherwise which requests
disclosure of Privileged Information relating to the Business, to the extent
not prohibited by Law, Seller or Purchaser (in the case of information
relating to matters for which Seller may  have indemnification obligations
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, or in the case of
Privileged Information not solely related to the Business and in which Seller
may have an interest), as applicable, shall as promptly  as practicable
provide to the other party (following the notice provisions set forth herein)
a copy of such notice, the intended response, and all materials or information
that might be disclosed and the proposed date of disclosure. In the  event of
a disagreement as to the intended

 


 

 


 

 

  82

 

 

 


 

  
   

response or disclosure, unless and until the disagreement is resolved as
provided in _Section 5.33(b)_ , the disclosing party shall, at the other
party's expense, cooperate to the extent such other party seeks to limit such
disclosure and take all  reasonable steps to resist or avoid such disclosure,
except as otherwise required by a court order requiring such disclosure.

 


 

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section  5.33_ shall limit a party's ability to assert
its rights under the Transaction Agreements in the event of any dispute
between the parties.

 


 

 

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, within 30 days following the date hereof,
Seller and  Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith the terms of, and enter
into, a joint defense agreement regarding certain matters of common interest
(including with respect any Shared Proceedings) arising from the transactions
contemplated by the  Transaction Agreements; _provided_ , that such joint
defense agreement shall not supersede the allocation of liabilities relating
to such Proceedings set forth in this  Agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.35 _Inventory_. Seller  shall cause the Companies to have, as of
the Closing, an amount of transactional inventory, including set-top boxes,
optical network terminals, modems and cabling necessary for installations,
equal to at least a thirty (30) day supply of such  transactional inventory
used in the operation of the Business in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

(i) Purchaser shall return to Seller or destroy (with confirmation to
Purchaser in writing of  such destruction) all documents and other materials
received by it or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives from Seller or
any of its Affiliates or any of  their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, agents or representatives relating to the
Transactions, whether obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;

 


 

 

(ii) all confidential information received by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any of  their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, agents or representatives with respect to the Business and the
Companies shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and  effect notwithstanding the termination
of this Agreement; and

 


 

 


 

  87

 

 


 

 


 

 

(iii) Seller shall return to Purchaser or destroy all documents and other
materials received by  it or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives from
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, shareholders,  agents or representatives relating to
the Transactions, whether obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement, and Seller shall keep, and cause its Affiliates to keep, all
information received by Seller or any of its Affiliates  from Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, agents or representatives relating to the
Transactions, whether obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement,  strictly confidential in accordance with the rules set forth in
_Section 5.16_ (Confidentiality),       applied mutatis mutandis.

 


 

 

SECTION 7.02 _Effect of Termination_.        (a) If this Agreement is
terminated and the Transactions are abandoned as described in _Section 7.01_
(Termination), this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect, except for the following provisions which shall survive such
termination:

 


 

 

(i) _Section 5.03_  (Confidentiality) (relating to the obligation of
Purchaser to keep confidential certain information obtained by it);

 


 

 

(ii) _Section 5.05_  (Expenses) (relating to certain expenses);

 


 

 

(iii) _Section 5.09_  (Publicity) (relating to publicity);

 


 

 

(iv) _Section 5.18(d)_  (Financing) (relating to expense reimbursement and
indemnification);

 


 

 

(v) _Article VII_ (Termination) (relating to termination); and

 


 

 

(vi) _Article IX_ (General Provisions) (relating to general matters).

 


 

 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.03_  (Termination Fee), which Termination Fee (to
the extent such fee is payable hereunder) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy to Seller in the case of  the termination of this Agreement, nothing
in this _Section 7.02_ shall be deemed to release any party from any liability
for any breach by such party of the terms  and provisions of this Agreement
or to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by any
other party of its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with (and
subject to the limitations set forth in) _Section 9.05_ (Right to Specific
Performance).

 


 

 

SECTION 7.03 _Termination Fee_.   (a) In the event that Seller shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)(v)_ (Termination), or
Purchaser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)(iv)(A)_
(Termination) and at such time Seller could have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)(v)_  (Termination), then Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid to Seller a termination fee of $86,125,000 in cash (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
three Business Days of such termination so long as Seller has provided
Purchaser with wire instructions for such

 


 

 


 

  88

 

 


 

 


 

 

payment (or, otherwise, within one Business Day following receipt of such wire
instructions), it being understood that in  no event shall Purchaser be
required to pay or cause to be paid the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 


 

 

(b) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if  Purchaser fails to timely pay or cause to be paid any amount
due pursuant to this _Section 7.03_, and, in order to obtain the payment,
Seller commences a Proceeding  which results in a Judgment against Purchaser
for the payment set forth in this _Section 7.03_, Purchaser shall pay or cause
to be paid to Seller interest on the  Termination Fee, from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment, at the prime rate
as published in The Wall Street Journal  in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject in
all respects to  Seller's injunction, specific performance and equitable
relief rights and related rights set forth in _Section 9.05_ (Right to
Specific Performance) and the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of
Purchaser under _Section 5.18_   (Financing) and _Section 7.03(b)_ hereof, in
the event that this Agreement  is terminated, payment of the Termination Fee
(to the extent such fee is payable pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and  its Affiliates against Purchaser,
Guarantor or any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers or
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") or the Lender
Related Parties for any loss, cost, expense or other Liability suffered or
incurred as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or 
for any breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and upon payment of such
amount none of the Purchaser Related Parties or the Lender Related Parties
shall have any  further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions. While Seller may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with (and subject to the limitations set
forth in) _Section 9.05_ (Right to Specific Performance) and the payment of
the Termination  Fee under this _Section 7.03_, under no circumstances shall
Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in a Closing  and any monetary damages, including
all or any portion of the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto further acknowledge and agree
that, prior to the Closing (and excluding, for the  avoidance of doubt, any
amounts payable at the Closing in accordance herewith), the aggregate
liability of Purchaser and its Affiliates under, or related to, this Agreement
whether or not this Agreement is terminated, and regardless of the  reason
for any such termination, shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount of
the Termination Fee plus $2,500,000.

respect to any other payment made pursuant to this Agreement), jointly and
severally, indemnify Purchaser against, and hold it harmless from, any loss,
liability, claim, damage, Tax or expense, including  reasonable and
documented third-party legal fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
suffered or incurred by Purchaser, its Affiliates (including the Companies) 
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
partners, members, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Indemnitees_ ")  (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which
indemnification is provided under _Section 8.03_ (Tax Indemnification)) to the
extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from:

 


 

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or
Intermediate Holdco in this  Agreement;

 


 

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement made
or to be  performed by Seller, Intermediate Holdco or any of their respective
Affiliates (including the Companies solely with respect to periods prior to
the Closing);

 


 

 

(iii) any Closing Indebtedness that should have been reflected in the Final
Closing Statement  but was not so reflected;

 


 

 

(iv) the Retained Credit Support Obligations;

 


 

 

(v) the Excluded Liabilities (as defined in the Reorganization Plan); and

 


 

 

(vi) any Refunded Required Payment or Unpaid Contingent Payment that has not
been paid to  Purchaser and any amount reflected as part of the Closing
Required Payment Amount in the Final Closing Statement that should not have
been so reflected.

 


 

 

(b) Seller and Intermediate Holdco shall not be required to indemnify any
Purchaser Indemnitee  and shall not have any liability:

 


 

 

(i) under _Section 8.01(a)(i)_  unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for
which Seller and Intermediate Holdco would, but for this clause (i), be liable
thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis $13,250,000 (the " _Deductible_ "),
and then only to the extent of any such excess;

 


 

 

(ii) under _Section 8.01(a)(i)_  for any individual items, or series of
related items, where the Loss relating thereto is less than $500,000 (the "
_Per Claim Threshold_ "), and such items shall not be  aggregated for
purposes of _Section 8.01(b)(i)_;

 


 

 


 

  90

 

 


 

 


 

 

(iii) under _Section 8.01(a)(i)_  in excess of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
(the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Cap, the Deductible
or the Per Claim Threshold shall apply with respect to any claim for
indemnification arising out of, relating to or  resulting from a breach or
alleged breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation; _provided_ _further_
,  _however_ , that the cumulative indemnification obligations of Seller and
Intermediate Holdco with respect to claims under this Agreement (including
with respect to any  claim for indemnification arising out of, relating to or
resulting from a breach or alleged breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation, but excluding with respect to any claim under _Section
8.01(a)(iii)_, _Section 8.01(a)(iv)_, _Section 8.01(a)(v)_  or _Section
8.01(a)(vi)_ , which shall not be capped) shall not exceed the
Purchase       Price; and

 


 

 

(iv) under _Section 8.01(a)_  to the extent the Loss arose in connection with
any breach of a representation and warranty or covenant made or to be
performed by Purchaser in this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Except for (i) any specific enforcement remedy to which a party is
entitled pursuant to _Section 9.05_ (Right to Specific Performance) and (ii)
claims of, or causes of  action arising from, Actual Fraud, Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and each other Purchaser Indemnitee, agrees that its sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all claims relating
to this Agreement shall be pursuant  to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article VIII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and each other Purchaser  Indemnitee, hereby waives, from
and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than those expressly contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately
preceding sentence) it or any Purchaser Indemnitee may  have against Seller,
Intermediate Holdco or any of their respective Affiliates arising under or
based upon this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection
herewith or any applicable Law, in each case except pursuant to the 
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section 8.01(c)_ shall in any way
impair the rights and obligations of Purchaser and Seller to resolve disputes
with respect to the Closing Statement and the Closing Unfunded Employee
Liability Statement and  the calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount and
the Final Unfunded Employee Liability Amount pursuant to _Section 1.04_
(Purchase Price Adjustment), and the fact that Purchaser may have the right to
pursue a claim for indemnification under _Article VIII_ with respect to any
facts or circumstances shall not operate to impair the application of _Section
1.04_ (Purchase Price Adjustment) in accordance with its terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be entitled to receive
indemnification for Losses (or Taxes) to the extent that any item is
specifically reflected in the  calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount
or the Final Unfunded Employee Liability Amount, as applicable.

 


 

 

(d) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder and for purposes of
establishing whether a  breach has occurred, any materiality, Seller Material
Adverse Effect or Material Adverse Effect qualifications (including any
phrases qualifying any matter by materiality) in the representations and
warranties in _Article II_ (Representations and Warranties Relating to Seller,
Intermediate Holdco and the Transferred  Equity Interests), _Article III_
(Representations and Warranties Relating  to the Companies) or in any

 


 

 


 

 

  91

 

 

 


 

  
   

certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall be disregarded (other than in
_Section 3.09(a)_ and in _Section 3.15_ (Absence of Changes or Events), each
of which shall retain such qualifications for such purposes).

 


 

 

SECTION 8.02 _General Indemnification by  Purchaser_. (a) Subject to the
terms (including the limitations) set forth in this _Article VIII_, from and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall (without  duplication with respect to any
other payment made pursuant to this Agreement) indemnify Seller and
Intermediate Holdco against, and hold them harmless from, any Loss suffered or
incurred by Seller, Intermediate Holdco and their respective  Affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
partners, members, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ")       (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which
indemnification is provided under _Section 8.03_ (Tax Indemnification)) to the
extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from:

 


 

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this
Agreement;

 


 

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement made
or to be  performed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Companies solely with respect to periods following the Closing);

 


 

 

(iii) any Closing Required Payment Amount that should have been reflected in
the Final Closing  Statement but was not so reflected or any amount that
subsequent to the Closing becomes a Required Payment Amount;

 


 

 

(iv) the Assumed Credit Support Obligations; and

 


 

 

(v) the Assumed Liabilities (as defined in the Reorganization Plan).

 


 

 

(b) Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee and
shall not have any  liability:

 


 

 

(i) under _Section 8.02(a)(i)_  unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for
which Purchaser would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds
on a cumulative basis the Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such
excess;

 


 

 

(ii) under _Section 8.02(a)(i)_  for any individual items where the Loss
relating thereto is less than the Per Claim Threshold, and such items shall
not be aggregated for purposes of _Section 8.02(b)(i)_;

 


 

 

(iii) under _Section 8.02(a)(i)_  in excess of the Cap; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of the Cap, the Deductible nor the  Per Claim Threshold
shall apply with respect to any claim for indemnification arising out of,
relating to or resulting from a breach or alleged breach of a Purchaser
Fundamental Representation; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the
cumulative  indemnification obligations of Purchaser with respect to claims
under this Agreement (including with respect to any claim for indemnification
arising out of, relating to or resulting from a breach or alleged breach of a
Purchaser Fundamental  Representation, but excluding with

 


 

 


 

 

  92

 

 


  
 

respect to any claim under _Section       8.02(a)(iii)_ , _Section
8.02(a)(iv)_ or _Section 8.02(a)(v)_ ,  which shall not be capped) shall not
exceed the Purchase Price; and

 


 

 

(iv) under _Section 8.02(a)_  to the extent the Loss arose in connection with
any breach of a representation and warranty or covenant made or to be
performed by Seller or Intermediate Holdco in this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Except for (i) any specific enforcement remedy to which a party is
entitled pursuant to _Section 9.05_ (Right to Specific Performance), (ii)
_Section 1.04_ (Purchase Price Adjustment) and (iii) claims of, or causes of
action arising from,  Actual Fraud, each of Seller and Intermediate Holdco,
on behalf of itself and each other Seller Indemnitee, agrees that its sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all claims relating
to this Agreement shall be  pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article VIII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Seller
and Intermediate Holdco, on behalf of  itself and each other Seller
Indemnitee, hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action (other than those expressly contemplated by
clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence) it or  any Seller
Indemnitee may have against Purchaser or any of Purchaser's Affiliates arising
under or based upon this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith or any applicable Law, in each case except pursuant to 
the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section 8.02(c)_
shall in any way impair the rights and obligations of Purchaser and Seller to
resolve disputes with respect to the Closing Statement and the Closing
Unfunded Employee Liability Statement and  the calculation of the Final
Closing Date Amount and the Final Unfunded Employee Liability Amount pursuant
to _Section 1.04_, and the fact that Seller and  Intermediate Holdco may have
the right to pursue a claim for indemnification under _Article VIII_ with
respect to any facts or circumstances shall not operate to  impair the
application of _Section 1.04_ in accordance with its terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Seller or Intermediate Holdco be entitled
to receive indemnification for Losses (or Taxes) to the extent that any item
is specifically  reflected in the calculation of the Final Closing Date
Amount or the Final Unfunded Employee Liability Amount, as applicable.

 


 

 

(d) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder and for purposes of
establishing whether a  breach has occurred, any materiality or Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect qualifications (including any phrases qualifying any
matter by materiality) in the representations and warranties in _Article IV_
(Representations and Warranties of Purchaser) or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto shall be  disregarded.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.03 _Tax Indemnification_.        (a) Subject to the terms
(including the limitations) set forth in this _Article VIII_, from and after
the Closing, Seller and Intermediate Holdco shall (without  duplication with
respect to any other payment made pursuant to this Agreement), jointly and
severally, indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates against, and hold them
harmless from:

 


 

 

(i) all Taxes of any Company, or imposed with respect to any of the
Transferred Assets, for any  Pre-Closing Tax Period;

 


 

 


 

  93

 

 


 

 


 

 

(ii) all Taxes of any Company, or imposed with respect to any of the

relating to Taxes made or to be performed by Seller, Intermediate Holdco or
any of their respective Affiliates (including the Companies solely with
respect to periods prior to the  Closing);

 


 

 

(iii) all Taxes of any Person other than any Company for which any Company
becomes liable as a  result of being or having been at any time before
Closing, part of any consolidated, combined, affiliated, aggregated, unitary
or similar group;

 


 

 

(iv) any Taxes of any Person other than any Company for which any Company
becomes liable as a  transferee or successor, by contract or by operation of
law, to the extent relating to a contract or other transaction entered into
prior to the Closing;

 


 

 

(v) all Transfer Taxes borne by Seller in accordance with _Section 5.08_ ;

 


 

 

(vi) all Taxes of any Company, or imposed with respect to any of the
Transferred Assets,  resulting from the Pre-Closing Reorganization, other
than Transfer Taxes described in Section 5.08; and

 


 

 

(vii) any reasonable and documented third-party fees, costs and expenses
resulting from the  items described in clauses (i) through (vi) above;

 


 

 

_provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in this Agreement,
Seller and Intermediate Holdco shall not be liable under this _Section 8.03_
for any Taxes (or third-party fees, costs and expenses resulting from  such
Taxes) to the extent any such Taxes (or fees, costs and expenses) (1) are
described in _Section 8.03(b)(ii)-(iv)_ or (2) result from any action taken or
omitted  to be taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing Date, the Companies) other than in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , that Seller's and Intermediate Holdco's
indemnity obligation pursuant to this _Section 8.03_  shall be reduced by the
amount of any refunds or credits of Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (net of any costs or expenses, including Tax costs, incurred by
Purchaser with respect thereto) to the extent received after the Closing 
Date by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any Company) required to
be, and not, remitted to Seller in accordance with _Section 5.07(c)_ (Refunds
and Credits) prior to the date on which Seller and Intermediate Holdco is
required to make the applicable indemnity payment hereunder; _provided_
further that Purchaser shall thereafter have no obligation to make the payment
set forth in _Section 5.07(c)_  (Refunds and Credits) in respect of such set-
off amount.

 


 

 

(b) Subject to the terms (including the limitations) set forth in this
_Article VIII_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller,
Intermediate Holdco and their respective Affiliates against, and hold them
harmless from:

 


 

 

(i) all Taxes of any Company, or imposed with respect to any of the
Transferred Assets, for any  Post-Closing Tax Period;

 


 

 


 

  94

 

 


 

 


 

 

(ii) all Taxes of any Company, or imposed with respect to any of the
Transferred Assets,  resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement
relating to Taxes made or to be performed by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Companies solely with respect to periods following
the Closing);

 


 

 

(iii) all Transfer Taxes borne by Purchaser in accordance with _Section 5.08_
; and

 


 

 

(iv) any reasonable and documented third-party fees, costs and expenses
resulting from the  items described in clauses (i) and (iii) above;

 


 

 

_provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not be liable under this _Section 8.03_ for any Taxes (or
third-party fees, costs and expenses resulting from such Taxes) to the 
extent any such Taxes (or fees, costs and expenses) are described in _Section
8.03(a)_.

 


 

 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 


 

 

(i) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as, solely by way of example,
real, personal and  intangible property taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days during the Straddle Period  that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle
Period;

 


 

 

(ii) Taxes (other than Taxes described in clause (i) above) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period  shall be computed (x) as if such taxable period ended as
of the close of business on the Closing Date and (y) in the case of any such
Taxes attributable to the ownership of any Equity Interest in a partnership,
other "flowthrough" entity or  "controlled foreign corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code or any comparable applicable Law), as if
the taxable period of that entity ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date; and

 


 

 

(iii) Overpayments of estimated Taxes of a Company by Seller, Intermediate
Holdco or their  respective Affiliates with respect to the pre-closing
portion of any Straddle Period and Taxes paid by Seller, Intermediate Holdco
or their respective Affiliates with respect to a Company before the Closing
Date that relate to a post-closing  portion of a Straddle Period shall, to
the extent they actually offset Taxes that Purchaser would otherwise be liable
for under this _Section 8.03_, be promptly  refunded by Purchaser to Seller
or Intermediate Holdco and in any case, within five Business Days from the
filing of any Straddle Period Tax Return. _Section 5.07(c)_  (Refunds and
Credits), rather than this _Section 8.03(c)(iii)_, shall  control in respect
of any Tax refunds or credits arising from payments of Taxes by Seller or
Intermediate Holdco for any Straddle Period.

 


 

 

(d) Any indemnity obligation for Taxes pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ shall
be paid within 30 Business Days after Purchaser, Seller or Intermediate
Holdco, as applicable, makes written demand upon the other party claiming it
is entitled to  indemnification

 


 

 


 

 

  95

 

 


   


 

 


 

 

under this _Section 8.03_  and the indemnifying party shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to pay such amounts prior to the date on which the relevant
Taxes are required to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.04 _Calculation of Losses;  Mitigation_. (a) The amount of any Loss
(including a Tax) for which indemnification is provided under this _Article
VIII_ shall be net of any amounts  recovered or recoverable by the
indemnified party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss. The
amount of the Loss (including a Tax) arising out of any item included as a
liability in calculating Closing Working Capital, if any,  shall be
calculated net of the amount so included.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or provided under
applicable Law, Losses  exclude (x) incidental, consequential and lost
profits damages (except, in each case, to the extent any such Losses were
reasonably foreseeable) and (y) punitive, special or treble damages (except,
in each case, to the extent any such Losses  are awarded and paid by an
indemnified party with respect to a Third Party Claim).

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser, Seller and Intermediate Holdco shall, and shall cause their
respective  Affiliates to, cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party or a Seller Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee
hereunder, including by using  commercially reasonable efforts to (i) resolve
any such claim or liability and (ii) mitigate any Loss for which
indemnification is sought under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such mitigation shall constitute
Losses for purposes of this Agreement. In the event that Purchaser, Seller
or  Intermediate Holdco shall fail to use such commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be
required to indemnify  any Person for any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense that would reasonably be expected to have been avoided if Purchaser,
Seller or Intermediate Holdco, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.05 _Tax Treatment of  Indemnification_. Any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.06 _Termination of Indemnification_.        The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any party (a) pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(i)_
(General Indemnification by Seller) or _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ (General
Indemnification by Purchaser) shall terminate when the applicable
representation or warranty terminates pursuant to _Section 8.09_ (Survival of
Representations and Covenants), (b) pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(ii)_ 
(General Indemnification by Seller) or _Section 8.02(a)(ii)_ (General
Indemnification by Purchaser) shall terminate when the applicable covenant or
agreement terminates pursuant to _Section 8.09_ (Survival of Representations
and Covenants) and (c) pursuant to _Section 8.03_ (Tax Indemnification) shall
terminate 30 calendar days following the expiration of  the applicable
statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to 
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to
which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the
applicable period, previously made a good faith claim by delivering a

 


 

 


 

  96

 

 


 

 


 

 

notice of such claim in writing (stating in reasonable detail the basis of
such claim) pursuant to _Section 8.07_ (Indemnification Procedures for Other
Than Tax Claims) or _Section 8.08_ (Indemnification Procedures for Tax Claims)
to  the party to be providing the indemnification.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.07 _Indemnification Procedures for  Other Than Tax Claims_.

 


 

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_.        In order for a Person (the "
_indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under _Section 8.01_ (General Indemnification by Seller) or _Section 8.02_ 
(General Indemnification by Purchaser) in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim made by any third Person against the indemnified party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must notify the party required
to provide indemnification therefor (the " _indemnifying party_ ") in writing
(and in reasonable detail) of the Third Party Claim within 30 Business Days
after receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided  hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party, within 10 Business Days after the indemnified  party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the failure to deliver any such notices or documents shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying  party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

 


 

 

(b) _Assumption_.   If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume (within 30 Business Days after
receipt of notice of such Third Party  Claim) the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable to the
indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim and the
indemnified party shall have the right to conduct and control the  defense of
such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom and in
connection therewith to employ, at the indemnifying party's expense, one
counsel of its choice in each applicable jurisdiction (if more than one
jurisdiction is  involved) to represent the indemnified party if (i) the
indemnifying party elects not to defend, compromise or settle a Third Party
Claim, (ii) if the indemnifying party fails to notify the indemnified party
within the required time period of  its election as provided in this _Section
8.07(b)_, (iii) the Third Party Claim has or would reasonably be expected to
result in Losses in excess of the amounts  available for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VIII_, (iv) the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive
or other equitable relief against an indemnified party,  (v) the Third Party
Claim involves or may involve criminal conduct or (vi) the indemnifying party,
having timely elected to defend a Third Party Claim, fails to adequately
prosecute or pursue such defense. Should the indemnifying party  assume, and
so elect in writing to assume, the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
the  defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the

 


 

 


 

  97

 

 


 

 


 

 

indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense. The  indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period
during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof (other
than during any period in which the  indemnified party shall have failed to
give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the indemnifying
party is entitled and chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all
the indemnified parties shall reasonably  cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such  Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
testify and provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a  Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability
with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim
without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the indemnifying
party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that
the indemnifying party may  recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim and which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnifying party shall not, without  prior written consent of the
indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in  (x) injunctive or
other nonmonetary relief against the indemnified party, including the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the indemnified party or (y) a finding or 
admission of fault or misconduct by the indemnified party.

 


 

 

(c) _Other Claims_.        In the event any indemnified party determines
that it has a claim against any indemnifying party under _Section 8.01_
(General Indemnification by Seller) or _Section 8.02_ (General Indemnification
by Purchaser) that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against
or sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party
shall promptly deliver written  notice of such claim (describing such claim
in reasonable detail) to the indemnifying party. Subject to _Section 8.06_
(Termination of Indemnification) and _Section 8.09_ (Survival of
Representations and Covenants), the failure by any indemnified party to so
notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from
any liability that it may have to such  indemnified party under _Section
8.01_ (General Indemnification by Seller)  or _Section 8.02_ (General
Indemnification by Purchaser), except to the  extent that the indemnifying
party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. If
the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within 45
calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the  indemnifying
party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under _Section 8.01_
(General Indemnification by Seller) or _Section 8.02_ (General 
Indemnification by Purchaser), such claim specified by the indemnified party
in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying
party under _Section 8.01_  (General Indemnification by Seller) or _Section
8.02_ (General

 


 

 


 

 

  98

 

 

 


 

  
   

Indemnification by Purchaser) and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount
of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any 
notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated,
on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof)
becomes finally determined.

 


 

 

(d) _Tax Claims_.   Tax Claims shall be governed by _Section 8.08_
(Indemnification Procedures for Tax  Claims) and not by this _Section 8.07_.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.08 _Indemnification Procedures for  Tax Claims_. (a) The
indemnified party shall promptly (and in any event within 30 Business Days of
receipt of written notice from the relevant Taxing Authority) notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of  any audit,
investigation, litigation, claim or other judicial or administrative
proceeding with respect to Taxes that, if successful, might result in an
indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 8.03_ (Tax Indemnification), such claim
(a " _Tax Claim_ ");       _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to
give such notice will not relieve the indemnifying  party of its
indemnification obligation under _Section 8.03_ (Tax
Indemnification),       except to the extent that such indemnifying
party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual
information (to the extent known) in reasonable detail to apprise the
indemnifying party of the nature of the Tax Claim, in  each case taking into
account the facts and circumstances with respect to such Tax Claim.

 


 

 

(b) Subject to _Section 8.08(c)_  and _8.08(d)_ , Seller shall have control
of all Proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim that relates solely
to Taxes for which Seller and Intermediate  Holdco have an indemnification
obligation under _Section 8.03_ (Tax Indemnification)  (such Taxes, "
_Indemnified Taxes_ "); but Purchaser shall have the right to participate in
such Proceedings at its own expense, and Seller shall not be able to settle, 
compromise or concede any portion of such Proceedings that is reasonably
likely to affect the Tax liability of a Company for any Post-Closing Tax
Period without the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that if Seller
fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Proceeding within a
reasonable period following the receipt by  Seller of notice of such
Proceeding, Purchaser shall have the right to assume control of such
Proceeding, in which case Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or concede
such Proceeding without the consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably 
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller shall have sole control of all
Proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to a Seller
Consolidated Group or a Seller Consolidated Return.

 


 

 

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall jointly control (at each party's sole expense)
all Proceedings  taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of
any Company for a Straddle Period (other than any Tax Claim relating to a
Seller Consolidated Group or a Seller Consolidated Return) and neither party
shall settle such a Proceeding  without the other party's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

 

 


 

 

(d) In the case of a Proceeding that relates both to Indemnified Taxes and
Taxes for which Purchaser is not  indemnified under _Section 8.03_ (Tax
Indemnification), Purchaser shall  control the conduct of such Proceeding,
but Seller shall have the right to participate in such Proceeding at its own
expense, and Purchaser shall not settle,

 


 

 


 

  99

 

 


 

 


 

 

compromise or concede such Proceeding without the Seller's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or
delayed). This _Section 8.08(d)_ shall not apply to Tax Claims relating to
Taxes for a Straddle Period, which is the subject of _Section 8.08(c)_.

 


 

 

(e) Purchaser shall have exclusive control of all other Proceedings relating
to Taxes with  respect to the Companies or the Transferred Assets not
otherwise governed by _Sections 8.08(b)_ , _8.08(c)_   or _8.08(d)_.

 


 

 

(f) Purchaser shall (and shall cause each Company to) cooperate with Seller,
and Seller shall  cooperate with Purchaser, in contesting any Tax Claim,
which cooperation shall include the retention of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim (and provision of such records to
the other party upon such other  party's reasonable request) and the making
of employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material relating to such Tax Claim.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.09 _Survival of Representations  and Covenants_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing as follows: (a) the Seller Fundamental
Representations and the Purchaser Fundamental  Representations shall survive
the Closing until 30 calendar days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations; (b) the representations and warranties in _Article
II_  (Representations and Warranties Relating to Seller, Intermediate Holdco
and the Transferred Equity Interests), _Article III_ (Representations and
Warranties Relating to the Companies) and _Article IV_ (Representations and
Warranties of Purchaser) (other than the Seller Fundamental  Representations,
the Purchaser Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties of Seller and Intermediate Holdco in _Section 3.11_ (Taxes)) shall
survive the Closing until the Indemnity Escrow Release Date; (c) the
representations and warranties of Seller and Intermediate Holdco in _Section
3.11_ (Taxes) shall not survive the Closing; and (d) the covenants and 
agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing until the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, except for those covenants
and agreements that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part at
or after the  Closing, which covenants shall survive in accordance with their
terms.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.10 _Release of Indemnity Escrow to  Seller_. (a) In the event that
any Purchaser Indemnitee shall have, prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release
Date, validly delivered a notice of a claim (a " _Pending  Claim_ ") in
respect of indemnification hereunder and made against the Indemnity Escrow
Account, the amount of Indemnity Escrow Funds that should be reserved (the "
_Reserve       Amount_ ") in respect of such Pending Claim shall be the
amount of Losses asserted in good faith by such Purchaser Indemnitee in
respect of such Pending Claim, prior to resolution of such Purchaser
Indemnitee's rights to  indemnification hereunder and the amount of such
Purchaser Indemnitee's Losses. Any Reserve Amounts held in the Indemnity
Escrow Account related to Pending Claims brought prior to the Indemnity Escrow
Release Date shall continue to be held  in the Indemnity Escrow Account until
such Pending Claim has been resolved or otherwise released in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.

 


 

 


 

  100

 

 


 

 


 

 

(b) Upon the resolution in accordance with the terms of this Agreement of the
amount of such  Purchaser Indemnitee's Losses in respect of any Pending
Claim, if any, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in
writing pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to release to the pertinent Purchaser
Indemnitee the lesser of (i)  the amount of such Losses and (ii) the balance
of the Indemnity Escrow Funds remaining at such time.

 


 

 

(c) Promptly following the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, and thereafter,
promptly following  the resolution of any Pending Claim with respect to any
Reserve Amount still held in the Indemnity Escrow Account, Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement to distribute to  Seller the Indemnity Escrow Funds
remaining at such time minus the sum of all Reserve Amounts outstanding
against such account at such time, if any.

Effect; or (b) to any Lender Related Party pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Financing for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise

SECTION 9.05 _Right to Specific Performance_.        The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be  entitled to
equitable relief, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in an appropriate court of competent 
jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.11_ (Consent to Jurisdiction),  this
being in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at Law or
in equity. The right to specific enforcement shall include the right of a
party hereto to cause the other party hereto to cause the Transactions to be 
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The parties hereto further agree (a) to waive any requirement for
the security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable
remedy, (b) not  to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable Law or inequitable for any
reason, or to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy; _provided_ that nothing contained in this clause (b) shall
prohibit a party from opposing a grant of specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that the party is not in  breach of this
Agreement or that such remedy is not permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and (c) that the provisions set forth in _Section 7.03_ (Termination
Fee) are not intended to and shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect Seller's right to specific enforcement in  accordance
with (and subject to the terms of) this _Section 9.05_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that
right, the parties hereto would not have entered into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of
Seller to seek an injunction,  specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Purchaser's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund a portion of the Purchase Price and
Purchaser's obligations to effect the Closing shall  be subject to the

 


 

 


 

  103

 

 


 

 


 

 

requirements that all of the following have been satisfied: (i) all conditions
in _Section 6.01_ (Conditions to Each Party's Obligation) and _Section 6.02_
(Conditions to Obligation of Purchaser) and all conditions in the  Equity
Commitment Letters were satisfied in full or waived in writing (other than
those conditions which by their terms can only be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing, but such conditions are capable of being satisfied on such
date  as if it were the Closing Date and the Closing would occur) at the time
when the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to _Section 1.02_
(Closing Date), but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded; (ii)
the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms  thereof or
will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; and (iii) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity 
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions
required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event
shall Seller be entitled to, or permitted to seek, specific performance
directly against  any Lender Related Party or to enforce specifically the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or any other agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing; _provided_   that this sentence shall not limit Seller's
rights to enforce Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement (including
_Section 5.18_ (Financing) in accordance with the terms hereof.

delivery and performance  under, or any dispute or Proceeding arising out of

from  Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Companies) attorney-client communications involving Cravath in connection with
the Current Representation, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller so as to
permit Seller to  participate in any such Proceedings, at Seller's sole cost

Agreement, on the other hand, the provisions of this Agreement shall

unenforceable in any jurisdiction, (a) a suitable and equitable provision
shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid 
or enforceable, such provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be

or  unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,

materially adverse to either of the parties hereto (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall be deemed to have occurred if _Section 7.03_ (Termination Fee)

accordance with its express terms).
