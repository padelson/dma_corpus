(the "Preliminary Allocation").   (b) Prior to the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser shall together and in good faith agree on the allocation of the
amounts set forth on the Preliminary Allocation to the Target Assets and
stock of the Purchased Subsidiaries for which stamp duty is payable in order

agree on (i) the total purchase price of the Purchased Assets for
Tax purposes (including for this purpose any Assumed Liabilities, the

Purchase Price made pursuant to Article IV and other relevant items that are
properly treated for Tax purposes as purchase price for the Purchased Assets
paid by Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees pursuant to this Agreement (the

with respect to each Purchased Subsidiary that immediately prior to the
Closing is a U.S. LLC that is classified as an entity disregarded as separate
from its sole owner under section 301.7701-3(b)(1) of the U.S. Treasury
Regulations, the total purchase price for Tax purposes of the assets of such
Purchased Subsidiary and an allocation of such total purchase price among the
assets of such Purchased Subsidiary (the "LLC Allocation"), in each case, in
a manner consistent with the Purchase Price set forth in Section 3.1, the
Preliminary Allocation, the Stamp Duty Allocation, the adjustments to the
Purchase Price made pursuant to Article IV and the applicable Tax Laws
(including, without limitation, Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S.
Treasury Regulations thereunder) and based on the Purchased Assets to which
such Assumed Liabilities, Net Inter-Company Payables Amount, adjustments to
the Purchase Price and other relevant items are attributable.   
-7-      (d) Seller and Purchaser shall together and in good faith agree
on any subsequent adjustment to the total purchase price of the Purchased
Assets for Tax purposes, the Final Allocation and the LLC Allocations (as the
case may be) that is required by reason of any indemnification payment or

which such payment is attributable and in accordance with applicable Tax
Laws, within 15 calendar days of such indemnification payment or other
payment being made pursuant to this Agreement.   (e) Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes
concerning any of the items described in subsection (b), (c) or (d) of this
Section 3.3 within the specified time period, provided, however, that if
Seller and Purchaser ultimately are unable to agree with respect to any of
such items within the specified time period, no later than ten calendar days
after the end of the specified time period, the items in dispute shall be
referred to a single Independent Firm, mutually selected and jointly engaged,
by the parties, for resolution by the Independent Firm. "Independent Firm"
shall mean either KPMG LLP or Deloitte and Touche LLP, or, if each of
those firms is unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto in
writing. The Independent Firm shall be instructed to notify Seller and
Purchaser in writing of its resolution of such disputed items within fifteen
Business Days of such referral, that the Independent Firm\'s review shall be
strictly limited to such disputed items and that its resolution of such
disputed items must be consistent with the Preliminary Allocation and all of
the items described in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 3.3 to
which the parties have agreed. The Independent Firm\'s resolution of such
disputed items shall be conclusive, final and binding on Seller and Purchaser
and their respective Affiliates for all Tax purposes and the Final Allocation
and the LLC Allocations shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The
expenses and fees of the Independent Firm incurred in connection with such
dispute shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on disputed items resolved by the Independent Firm, which
proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Independent Firm at
the time the determination of the Independent Firm is rendered on the
disputed items.   (f) The Final Allocation and the LLC Allocations, as
finally determined under this Section 3.3 and as adjusted from time to time
under subsection (d) of this Section 3.3, shall be final and binding on
Seller and Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates, including the
Purchased Subsidiaries) for all Tax purposes (including, without limitation,
for purposes of the preparation and filing of Tax Returns, subject to
adjustment to reflect Seller\'s selling expenses as a reduction in sales
proceeds and Purchaser\'s acquisition expenses as an adjustment to purchase
price), and Seller and Purchaser shall not take (or cause or permit any of
their respective Affiliates, including the Purchased Subsidiaries, to take)
any position inconsistent with the Final Allocation or the LLC Allocations in
any Tax Return or Tax Matter, except to the extent required pursuant to a
Determination.   (g) Promptly following the final determination of the LLC
Allocations, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly prepare, and Purchaser and
Seller each shall file (or cause to be filed), in each case in a manner
consistent with the LLC Allocations and applicable Tax Law, the Forms 8594
with respect to the purchase and sale of the interests in the U.S.
LLCs.    -8-     3.4. PAYMENT OF INTER-COMPANY PAYABLES AND

designated by Purchaser), as agent for the Purchased Subsidiaries, shall,
pursuant to Section 3.2, pay to Seller (as agent for members of the Invensys
Group to which the Inter-Company Payables are owed) an amount equal to the
sum of the Inter-Company Payables, such amount being the repayment in full of
the Inter-Company Payables.   (b) At Closing and for value, Seller (or any
Affiliate designated by Seller), as agent for the members of the Invensys
Group from which the Inter-Company Receivables are owed, shall, pursuant to

relating to the Inter-Company Report, and Seller shall cooperate with
Purchaser and its independent auditors to provide them with any
other information used in preparing the Inter-Company Report reasonably
requested by Purchaser and its independent auditors.   (d) The Inter-
Company Report shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 35th
Business Day following Closing unless the Purchaser gives written notice of
its disagreement with the Inter-Company Report (an "Inter-Company Notice of
Disagreement") to Seller prior to such date. Any Inter-Company Notice of
Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on errors
of fact or mathematical errors in the Inter-Company Report, or based on the
Net Inter-Company Payables Amount as shown in the Inter-Company Report not
being calculated in accordance with this Section 3.4.   (e) If an Inter-
Company Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in a timely manner, then
the Inter-Company Report (as revised in accordance with this Section 3.4(e))
shall become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of
(A) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing any differences they
have with respect to the matters specified in the Inter-Company Notice
of Disagreement or (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved
in writing by the Independent Firm. The Inter-Company Report, as agreed by
the parties, or as determined by the Independent Firm, as the case may be,
shall be referred to as the "Final Inter-Company Report."   (f) During the
30-day period following the delivery of an Inter-Company Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Inter-Company Notice of Disagreement. At the end of
such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall submit in writing a   
-9-    description of any and all matters that remain in dispute and were
included in the Inter-Company Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section
3.4(d), to an Independent Firm for arbitration. The scope of the disputes to
be resolved by the Independent Firm shall be limited to disputes concerning
whether there were errors of fact or mathematical errors in the Inter-Company
Report, and the Independent Firm is not permitted to make any other
determination.   (g) Seller and Purchaser agree to use reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Firm to render a decision resolving any matters
submitted to the Independent Firm within 30 days following submission.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Independent Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced.   (h) The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the Independent Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of
the parties) pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be borne by Purchaser and
Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Independent Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Independent Firm at the time the determination of the Independent Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.   (i) The fees and
disbursements of Purchaser\'s independent auditors incurred in connection
with their report on the Inter-Company Report and review of any Inter-Company
Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Purchaser, and the fees and
disbursements of Seller\'s independent auditors incurred in connection
with their review of the Inter-Company Report and any Inter-Company Notice
of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller.   (j) Until the full and complete
resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 3.4, Purchaser shall provide to Seller and any accountants, counsel
or financial advisors retained by Seller in connection with any adjustment to

hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Business retained or controlled by Seller relevant to the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 3.4 and shall allow copies of the records to be
made.   (k) To the extent that the Final Inter-Company Report shall differ
from the Inter-Company Report, the payments made pursuant to Section 3.2
shall be deemed to have been modified so as to be consistent with the final
amounts of the Inter-Company Payables and the Inter-Company Receivables set
out in the Final Inter-Company Report.   (l) Unless reflected in the Final
Inter-Company Report, all Inter-Company Payables and Inter-Company
Receivables shall be deemed to be cancelled at the Closing.

each Inter-Company Receivable) for each Purchased Subsidiary.   "Net Inter-
Company Payables Amount" means the sum of the Inter-Company Payables for each
Purchased Subsidiary less the sum of the Inter-Company Receivables for each
Purchased Subsidiary.  3.5. WITHHOLDING RIGHTS: Purchaser and the Purchaser
Designees shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price or
any other payment owed at Closing under to this Agreement such amounts that
are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and accompanying U.S.
Treasury Regulations and any similar withholding requirements under state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law by reason of the transactions consummated pursuant
to this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) Purchaser shall notify Seller,
as soon as practicable and in any event no later than twenty (20) Business
Days before the Closing Date, of any amounts that the Purchaser or Purchaser
Designee intends to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price or any such
other payment (other than any deductions or withholdings that may be required
pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code or Section 116 of the Income Tax Act
(Canada)), and (ii) Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees shall not be
entitled to deduct or withhold any amounts from the Purchase Price or any
other payment owed at Closing under to this Agreement (x) pursuant to Section
1445 of the Code unless Seller has breached Section 7.8(a) or (y) in the case
of the payment in consideration for Seller\'s entry into the Non-Competition
Agreement referred to in Section 3.1 unless Seller has breached Section
7.8(b). Upon Seller\'s request, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Purchaser Designees to, cooperate with and assist Seller in taking
any measures that may be reasonably necessary and appropriate to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any such deductions or withholdings or to obtain a Tax
refund or credit for Seller or any of its Affiliates of any amounts so
withheld or deducted. Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees shall pay over to
the appropriate taxing authorities any amounts so withheld on or prior to the
due date for such payments and shall provide to Seller a certified copy of
an official receipt of the tax    -11-     authority evidencing such
payment, and to the extent that amounts so withheld are paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.   ARTICLE IV.  Purchase Price
Adjustments  4.1. YEAR END FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:   (a) Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Purchaser by May 15, 2002 audited
financial statements for the Business (the "Year End Financial Statements")
comprised of (i) a combined profit and loss account for the period beginning
April 1, 2001, and ending March 31, 2002 ("Year End Profit and
Loss Account"), (ii) a combined balance sheet as at March 31, 2002 ("Year End
Balance Sheet"), (iii) a combined statement of cash flows for the period
beginning April 1, 2001, and ending at March 31, 2002 and (iv) footnotes with
respect to each thereof.   (b) The Year End Financial Statements shall:  
(i) be prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP applied on a basis  consistent
with the basis on which U.K. GAAP was applied in connection with  the
preparation of the Financial Statements for the nine months ended  December
31, 2001 (the "December Financial Statements");   (ii) be prepared on the
basis of the applicable actual exchange rates  as of March 2002 in respect of
the Year End Balance Sheet and the average  exchange rate from April 1, 2001
to March 31, 2002 in respect of the Year  End Profit and Loss Account, such
applicable exchange rates to be as  published in the Financial Times; and  
(iii) include a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP as to the items identified 
therein.   (c) The Year End Financial Statements shall (i) include the
consolidation, statutory or other adjustments needed to present the Year End
Financial Statements in conformity with U.K. GAAP consistent with the
December Financial Statements, and (ii) be the basis from which the (A)
Statement of EBITDA and (B) the Net Book Value Statement shall be derived for
the purposes of this Article IV. Until the full and complete resolution of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Article IV, Seller
shall provide Purchaser and any accountants, counsel or financial advisors
retained by Purchaser in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Article IV reasonable access during normal business
hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Business retained or controlled by Seller relevant to the Year End Financial
Statements contemplated by this Section 4.1 and shall allow copies of their
records to be made. Until the full and complete resolution of any adjustment
to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Article IV, Purchaser shall
provide to Seller and any accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained
by Seller in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Article IV and in connection with the preparation of the
Year End Financial Statements reasonable access during normal business hours
to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Business retained or controlled by Purchaser relevant to the Year End   
-12-      Financial Statements contemplated by this Section 4.1 and
shall allow copies of their records to be made.  4.2. EBITDA PURCHASE PRICE
ADJUSTMENT:   (a) As promptly as practicable, but not later than 20 Business
Days after the delivery of the Year End Financial Statements, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser a statement of the earnings before restructuring costs
and other exceptional items, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(the "EBITDA") of the Business (the "Statement of EBITDA"), for the financial
year beginning on April 1, 2001 and ended March 31, 2002, together with a
statement by the independent auditors of the Seller that the Statement of
EBITDA has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of this Section
4.2.   (b) The Statement of EBITDA shall be prepared in a format and
manner consistent with Schedule 4.2 that identifies the specific line items
and adjustments that will be included in EBITDA for the purposes of this
Section 4.2, except that the amounts reflected in such Statement shall be as
of the year ended March 31, 2002, rather than as of the nine months ended
December 31, 2001 and shall be derived from the Year End Financial
Statements. Amounts set forth in the Statement of EBITDA shall be stated in
both U.K. Pounds Sterling and U.S. Dollars.   (c) For the purposes of the
EBITDA Purchase Price Adjustment (as defined below), the EBITDA for the year
ended March 31, 2002 as derived from the Year End Financial Statements is to
be adjusted, if necessary, such that the EBITDA is calculated in accordance
with U.K. GAAP applied the same way, using the same accounting policies,
practices, methodologies, judgments and income statement classifications used
in preparing the result for the nine months ended December 31, 2001 (the
"Reference Income Statement"). Such adjustments shall be made, to the extent
required, to achieve consistency of measurement contemplated above, including
to reflect:   (i) that the Business was trading under Seller\'s continuing
ownership  up to the March 31, 2002;   (ii) so as to exclude any charge,
accrual, provision, reserve or write  off in respect of any costs,
liabilities or charges to be incurred after  the Closing, or in respect of
any asset included in the financial  statements at or before March 31, 2002,
in any such case, (A) as a  consequence of such change of ownership of the
Business or any change in  management strategy, direction or priority that
results from such change in  ownership, including, but not limited to, any
disposal, closure,  reorganization or restructuring of any operations of the
Business, or (B)  relating to the recording of the acquisition of the
Business by Purchaser.   (d) The foregoing principles are referred to in
this Agreement as the "Reference Income Statement Principles." The adjustment
contemplated by this Section 4.2 is intended to show the difference, if any,
between the projected EBITDA of $87 million (calculated on the basis of the
December Financial Statements) and the actual EBITDA for the year ended March
31, 2002, and such difference can only be measured if the calculation is done
in the same way, using the same accounting methods, for both amounts.   
-13-     (e) In the event that the amount of EBITDA set forth on the
Statement of EBITDA is less than $81 million (and the Closing has occurred),
then Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount, and, if the Closing has not
yet occurred, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount, equal to 6
times the difference between the amount of EBITDA set forth on the Statement
of EBITDA and $81 million, in immediately available funds (the "EBITDA
Purchase Price Adjustment").   (f) Purchaser\'s accountants will be kept
informed during the preparation of the Statement of EBITDA and may review
working papers of the Seller and the Seller\'s independent auditors,
provided, however, that Purchaser acknowledges that Seller shall have the
primary responsibility and authority for preparing the Year End Financial
Statements and the Statement of EBITDA, and Seller\'s independent auditors
shall have the primary responsibility and authority for preparing the
Statement of EBITDA.   (g) During the 30-day period following Purchaser\'s
receipt of the Statement of EBITDA, Purchaser and its independent auditors
shall be permitted to review the working papers relating to the Statement of
EBITDA and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser and its independent auditors
to provide them with any other information used in preparing the Statement of
EBITDA reasonably requested by Purchaser and its independent auditors.  
(h) The Statement of EBITDA shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the 30th day following delivery unless the Purchaser gives written
notice of its disagreement with the Statement of EBITDA (an "EBITDA Notice
of Disagreement") to Seller prior to such date. Any EBITDA Notice of
Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on errors
of fact or mathematical errors in the Year End Financial Statements and/or
the Statement of EBITDA, or based on the EBITDA as shown in the Statement of
EBITDA not being calculated in accordance with this Section 4.2.   (i) If
an EBITDA Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in a timely manner,
pursuant to Section 4.2(h), then the Statement of EBITDA (as revised
in accordance with this Section 4.2(i)) shall become final and binding upon
Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the EBITDA Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date any disputed
matters are finally resolved in writing by the Independent Firm.   (j)
During the 30-day period following the delivery of an EBITDA Notice
of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the EBITDA Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day
period, Seller and Purchaser shall submit in writing a description of any and
all matters that remain in dispute and were included in the EBITDA Notice of
Disagreement pursuant to Section 4.2(h), to an Independent Firm for
arbitration. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Firm
shall be limited to disputes concerning whether such calculation was done in
accordance with the Reference Income Statement Principles, and whether there
were errors of fact or mathematical errors in the Statement of EBITDA. The
Independent Firm is not permitted to make any other determination.   
-14-      (k) Seller and Purchaser agree to use reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Firm to render a decision resolving any matters
submitted to the Independent Firm within 30 days following submission.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Independent Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced.   (l) The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the Independent Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of
the parties) pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be borne by Purchaser and
Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Independent Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Independent Firm at the time the determination of the Independent Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.   (m) The fees and
disbursements of Seller\'s independent auditors incurred in connection with
their report on the Statement of EBITDA and review of any EBITDA Notice of
Disagreement shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and disbursements of
Purchaser\'s independent auditors incurred in connection with their review
of the Statement of EBITDA and any EBITDA Notice of Disagreement shall be
borne by Purchaser.   (n) Until the full and complete resolution of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 4.2, Seller
shall provide to Purchaser and any accountants, counsel or financial advisors
retained by Purchaser in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 4.2 reasonable access during normal business
hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Business retained or controlled by Seller relevant to the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 4.2 and shall allow copies of their records to
be made. Until the full and complete resolution of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 4.2, Purchaser shall provide to
Seller and any accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained by Seller
in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 4.2 reasonable access during normal business hours to all the
properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the Business retained
or controlled by Purchaser relevant to the adjustment contemplated by this
Section 4.2 and shall allow copies of their records to be made.   (o)
Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall be construed to limit the condition to
Purchaser\'s obligation contained in Section 10.10.  4.3. NET BOOK VALUE
PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT:   (a) Within 20 Business days after the delivery
of the Year End Financial Statements, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a statement (the "Net Book Value Statement"), setting forth the Net
Book Value of the Business as of March 31, 2002 (the "Stated Net Book Value")
together with a statement by the independent auditors of the Seller that the
Net Book Value Statement has been prepared in compliance with the
requirements of this Section 4.3.   (b) The Net Book Value Statement shall
be prepared in a format and manner consistent with Schedule 4.3 that
identifies the specific line items and adjustments that will be included for
the purposes of this Section 4.3, except that the amounts reflected in
such    -15-     Statement shall be as of the year ended March 31,
2002 rather than as of December 31, 2001 and shall be derived from the Year
End Financial Statements. Amounts set forth in the Net Book Value Statement
shall be stated in both U.K. Pounds Sterling and U.S. Dollars.   (c) The
term "Net Book Value" means the aggregate of the amounts extracted from the
Year End Financial Statements with respect to the following line items (A)
Tangible Fixed Assets; (B) Investments in Associated Undertakings; (C)
Other Fixed Asset Investments; (D) Stocks; (E) Gross Trade Debtors, (F)
Amounts recoverable on long-term contracts; (G) Other debtors; (H)

one year: Other debtors (K) Payments received on account; (L) Trade
creditors; (M) Other creditors; (N) Accruals and deferred income; (O)
Invensys Group balances payable and falling due within one year; (P)
Provisions for Liabilities and Charges - Pensions; (Q) Provisions for
Liabilities and Charges - Post Retirement Benefits; (R) Provisions for
Liabilities and Charges - Warranties; and (S) Minority Interests - Equity,
together with such adjustments required to comply with Section 4.3(d).  
(d) The line items that comprise Net Book Value shall be calculated
in accordance with U.K. GAAP applied in the same way, using the same
accounting policies, practices, methodologies, judgments and balance sheet
classifications used in preparing the balance sheet as at December 31, 2001
(the "Reference Balance Sheet"). The foregoing principles are referred to in
this Agreement as the "Balance Sheet Principles." Adjustments shall be made
to the extent required to ensure consistency with the basis on which the
Adjusted Net Book Value amount of $281.4 million set out in Section 4.3(e)
was calculated as illustrated on Schedule 4.3, including to:   (i) reflect
the arrangements relating to the lease with respect to the  property at
Walsroder Str. 9, 11, 13 and 15, Munchner Str. 67, 77 and 79  and Hemmstr 130
in Bremen, Germany (the "Gestra Lease") as a finance lease;   (ii) reflect
only trade debtors and related bad debt, credit note and  other provisions
and to exclude the impact of factoring or discounting of  trade debtors;  
(iii) that the Business was trading under Seller\'s continuing  ownership up
to the March 31, 2002;   (iv) so as to exclude any charge, accrual,
provision, reserve or write  off in respect of any costs, liabilities or
charges to be incurred after  the Closing, or in respect of any asset
included in the financial  statements at or before March 31, 2002, in any
such case, (A) as a  consequence of such change of ownership of the Business
or any change in  management strategy, direction or priority that results
from such change in  ownership, including, but not limited to, any disposal,
closure,  reorganization or restructuring of any operations of the Business,
or (B)  relating to the recording of the acquisition of the Business by
Purchaser;   (v) exclude assets and liabilities in respect of Taxes; and  
(vi) exclude Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities.    -16-     
(e) The Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which the
actual Net Book Value at Closing is less than $262.5 million (the Purchase
Price as so adjusted shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Net Book Value
Adjusted Purchase Price").   (f) If the Purchase Price (disregarding for
this purpose any other adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for in this
Agreement) is more than the Net Book Value Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller
shall, within the later of five Business Days after the Net Book Value
Statement becomes final and binding on the parties and five Business Days
after the Closing, make payment to Purchaser by wire transfer in immediately
available funds of the amount of such difference.   (g) Purchaser\'s
accountants will be kept informed during the preparation of the Net Book
Value Statement and may review working papers of the Seller and the Seller\'s
independent auditors, provided, however, that Purchaser acknowledges that
Seller shall have the primary responsibility and authority for preparing the
Year End Financial Statements and the Net Book Value Statement and
Seller\'s independent auditors shall have the primary responsibility and
authority for reporting on the Net Book Value Statement.   (h) During the
30-day period following Purchaser\'s receipt of the Net Book Value Statement,
Purchaser and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review the
working papers relating to the Net Book Value Statement and Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser and its independent auditors to provide them
with any other information used in preparing the Net Book Value Statement
reasonably requested by Purchaser and its independent auditors.   (i) The
Net Book Value Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on
the 30th day following delivery unless the Purchaser gives written notice of
its disagreement with the Net Book Value Statement (a "Net Book Value Notice
of Disagreement") to Seller prior to such date. Any Net Book Value Notice of
Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of
any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on
errors of fact or mathematical errors in the Year End Financial Statements
and/or the Net Book Value Statement, or based on the Net Book Value as shown
in the Net Book Value Statement not being calculated in accordance with this
Section 4.3.   (j) If a Net Book Value Notice of Disagreement is received by
Seller in a timely manner, then the Net Book Value Statement (as revised in
accordance with this Section 4.3(j)) shall become final and binding upon
Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Net Book Value Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date any
disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Independent Firm.  
(k) During the 30-day period following the delivery of an Net Book
Value Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith
to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Net Book Value Notice of Disagreement. At the end of
such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall submit in writing a

Independent Firm for arbitration. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by
the Independent Firm shall be limited to disputes   
-17-      concerning whether such calculation was done in accordance
with the Reference Balance Sheet Principles, and whether there were errors of
fact or mathematical errors in the Net Book Value Statement, and the
Independent Firm is not to make any other determination.   (l) Seller and
Purchaser agree to use reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Firm to
render a decision resolving any matters submitted to the Independent Firm
within 30 days following submission. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Independent Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced.   (m) The cost
of any arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Independent Firm
and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this
Section 4.3 shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on matters resolved by the Independent Firm, which
proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Independent Firm at
the time the determination of the Independent Firm is rendered on the
merits of the matters submitted.   (n) The fees and disbursements of
Seller\'s independent auditors incurred in connection with their report on
the Net Book Value Statement and review of any Net Book Value Notice of

Closing, but not later than 30 Business Days after Closing, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller a statement of the Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance (as
defined below) of the Business (the "Statement of Final Cash/Overdraft Debt
Balance"), as of the Closing.   (b) For purposes of this Article IV:   (i)
"Cash" means the aggregate amount of cash as shown on the books  and records
of the Purchased Subsidiaries (rather than as shown on the bank  statements
of the    -18-       Purchased Subsidiaries) and therefore shall be
reduced by any checks, wire  transfers, giros, or any other debits written or
otherwise executed on or  prior to the Closing Date that have not yet cleared
the bank accounts; and  shall be increased by any deposits or cash in transit
(including from other  Invensys Group companies or Purchased Subsidiaries)
that have not yet been  credited to the bank accounts, less (A) $3.25 million
and (B) $1.575  million (it being understood that the resulting number may be
a negative  number).   (ii) "Overdraft Debt" means the aggregate amount of
indebtedness as  shown on the books and records of the Purchased Subsidiaries
(rather than  as shown on the bank statements of the Purchased Subsidiaries)
and  therefore shall be increased by any checks, wire transfers, giros, or

amount of Cash  reduced by the amount of Overdraft Debt.   (iv)
"Restructuring Provision" means the aggregate amount of the  liabilities at
Closing in respect restructuring projects at Gestra GmbH,  IFC Germany GmbH
and NAF AB (including but not limited to liabilities for  obligations under
old-age-part-time severance arrangements in Germany) and  any other similar
liabilities that would be classified within the line item  `Provisions for
liabilities and charges - Restructuring\' in a set of  financial statements
prepared consistently with the Year End Financial  Statements which, for
purposes of reference, was (pound)3.8 million as of  December 31, 2001.  
(c) The Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance as finally agreed will be paid as
follows:   (i) if the Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance is a positive
amount,  then Purchaser will pay Seller the amount of the Final
Cash/Overdraft Debt  Balance together with interest at LIBOR from the Closing
Date, within five  Business Days after the Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance
is determined;   (ii) if the Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance is a negative
amount  then Seller will pay Purchaser the amount of Final Cash/Overdraft
Debt  Balance, together with interest at LIBOR from the Closing Date, within
five  Business Days after the Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance is
determined;   (d) The Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance will constitute an
upward or downward, as the case may be, adjustment of the Closing Payment

Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance, and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller
and its independent auditors to provide them with any other information used

upon the parties on the 20th day following delivery unless the Seller gives
written notice of its disagreement with the Statement of Final Cash/Overdraft
Debt Balance (a "Cash/Debt Notice of Disagreement") to Purchaser prior to
such date. Any Cash/Debt Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify
in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii)
only include disagreements based on errors of fact or mathematical errors in
the Statement of Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance, or based on the
Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance as shown in the Statement of Final
Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance not being calculated in accordance with this
Section 4.4.   (g) If a Cash/Debt Notice of Disagreement is received by
Purchaser in a timely manner, then the Statement of Final Cash/Overdraft Debt
Balance (as revised in accordance with this Section 4.4(g) shall become final
and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of (A) the date Seller
and Purchaser resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to
the matters specified in the Cash/Debt Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date
any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Independent
Firm.   (h) During the 30-day period following the delivery of an Cash/Debt

resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Cash/Debt Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such

mathematical errors in the Statement of Final Cash/Overdraft Debt Balance,
and the Independent Firm is not permitted to make any other
determination.   (i) Seller and Purchaser agree to use reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Firm to render a decision resolving any matters
submitted to the Independent Firm within 30 days following submission.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Independent Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced.   (j) The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the Independent Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of
the parties) pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be borne by Purchaser and
Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Independent Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Independent Firm at the time the determination of the Independent Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.    -20-       (k)

ACTIONS: From time to time after the Closing Date, upon request of Purchaser,
Seller and each member of Seller Group, without further consideration, shall
cooperate with Purchaser and shall duly execute, acknowledge and deliver all
such further deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and powers of
attorney and take such other actions and give such assurances as may be
reasonably required to convey to and vest in Purchaser all right, title and
interest in the Purchased Assets. Seller shall promptly pay or deliver to
Purchaser any amounts or items which may be received by Seller or any member
of Seller    -23-     Group on or after the Closing Date which
constitute Purchased Assets and Purchaser shall promptly pay or deliver to
Seller any amounts or items which may be received by Purchaser on or after

responsible for all costs relating to the preparation and the filing, or
other recordation, of all instruments of transfer or assignment reasonably
necessary to vest in Purchaser title to the Seller Intellectual Property (as
defined in Section 8.11(c)) whether such documents are executed by Seller at
the Closing under Section 5.1(c)(iii) or after the Closing Date.  6.2.
PURCHASED ASSETS REQUIRING CONSENTS: In the event any consent or waiver of a
third party which is legally required in order for Seller to effect the
sale, assignment or transfer to Purchaser or any Purchaser Designee of any
Target Asset (including any consents referred to in Section 10.3 with respect
to which Purchaser has waived the closing condition) has not been obtained by
the Closing Date then such Target Asset shall not be deemed to be sold,
transferred, conveyed or assigned to Purchaser at the Closing. If a Target
Asset is not so sold, transferred, conveyed or assigned, or if any consent or
waiver of a third party which is legally required to enable the Purchased
Subsidiaries to continue to use after the Closing Date any assets used in,
held for use or pertaining to the Business (such assets the "Purchased
Subsidiary Assets"), has not been obtained by the Closing Date, the following
shall apply:   (a) Seller shall, and shall cause the relevant member of the
Seller Group to, use all reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate with
Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser Designee in entering into a reasonable
arrangement designed to provide Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser Designee
with the benefit of Seller\'s rights (or the rights of the relevant Seller
Group member) under or pursuant to or in respect of such Target Asset, or to
enable the continued use by the Purchased Subsidiaries of the Purchased
Subsidiary Assets (provided that Seller shall not be required to make any
additional payments or incur any additional liabilities to enter into such
arrangement);   (b) Seller shall, and shall cause the relevant member of the
Seller Group to, use its reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate with
Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser Designee in obtaining any such required
consent or waiver as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (provided
that Seller should not be required to make any payments to the third party
whose consent is being sought); and   (c) immediately upon obtaining all
legally required consents or waivers for such Target Asset, such Target Asset
shall be deemed to be sold, transferred, conveyed or assigned to Purchaser or
the relevant Purchaser Designee as of the receipt of such consents or waivers
and Seller or the appropriate member of Seller Group shall execute, without
further consideration from Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser Designee, any
documents reasonably requested by Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser
Designee to confirm that such Target Asset, as applicable, has been sold,
transferred, conveyed or assigned to Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser
Designee.   (d) immediately upon obtaining all legally required consents or
waivers for such Purchased Subsidiary Asset, the Seller or the appropriate
member of the Seller Group shall, without further consideration from
Purchaser or the relevant Purchased Subsidiary, execute any   
-24-     documents reasonably requested by the Purchaser or the relevant
Purchased Subsidiary to confirm the right to the continued use of such
Purchased Subsidiary Asset.  6.3. CERTAIN PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including the Schedules hereto), this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement by Seller to sell, assign or transfer or an offer to sell, assign
or transfer any of the interests listed on Schedule 6.3 hereto (the "Joint
Venture Interests") in the joint ventures listed on Schedule 6.3 hereto (the
"Business Joint Ventures"), each of which may be subject to a right of first
offer in favor of a third party. The parties acknowledge and agree that
Seller may not be able to transfer the Joint Venture Interests or some
portion thereof to Purchaser at the Closing because of existing
contractual or other obligations of Seller or its Affiliates (or the
applicable provisions of the joint venture agreement, limited liability
company agreement or other constitutive document of a Business Joint
Venture). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Article III
hereof, if Seller is unable to transfer the Joint Venture Interests relating
to any Business Joint Venture at the Closing, Purchaser shall be entitled to
reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the value of such Joint
Venture Interests as mutually agreed by the parties acting reasonably (which
values shall not exceed the fair market values of such Joint Venture
Interests) prior to the offering of such Joint Venture Interests to the
applicable third parties.   ARTICLE VII.  Actions Prior to Closing  7.1.
ACCESS: Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries, officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives to, afford to Purchaser and its representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours and in a manner that is not
unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the Business or the business of
Seller and its subsidiaries, to the properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records of (i) the Purchased Subsidiaries and (ii)
of members of the Seller Group and holders of Target Assets primarily
relating to the Business during such period, Seller shall, and shall cause
its subsidiaries, officers, employees and representatives to, furnish as
promptly as practicable to Purchaser all information concerning the
properties, financial condition, operations and personnel of the Purchaser
Subsidiaries and the Business as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably
request. In no event shall Purchaser be permitted to conduct, prior to the
Closing Date, Phase II environmental assessments or any other sampling or
testing of soil and/or ground or surface waters at, on or under the Real
Property (as defined in Section 8.5(b)). Purchaser will hold, and will cause
its directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives and Affiliates, successors and assigns to hold, any
nonpublic information in confidence to the extent required by, and
in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement,
previously entered into, between or on behalf of Purchaser and Seller, the
terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").  7.2. OBTAINING OF APPROVALS AND CONSENTS:

make all filings under the HSR Act (as defined in Section 10.3) required in
connection with    -25-     the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) make all
other necessary filings with all governmental bodies or other regulatory
authorities to obtain licenses, permits, approvals, or authorizations and (y)
obtain all consents of third parties in each case required for the sale,
assignment or transfer to Purchaser of any of the Target Assets or Purchased
Subsidiaries or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (b) Each party shall bear its own cost of complying with
or obtaining the consent to or approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby of any governmental or third party, including, without limitation, any
such approval or consent required by any safety, health, environmental or
other applicable law or regulation. Each party hereto shall provide to the
other party such information as the other party may reasonably request in
order to enable it to prepare such filings. Each party hereto shall also use
its reasonable best efforts to expedite any governmental or other third party
review and to obtain all such necessary consents, approvals, licenses and
permits as promptly as practicable.   (c) Purchaser and Seller agree to have
Purchaser Designees and members of the Seller Group enter into individual
transfer agreements no later than the Closing Date, covering portions of the
overall sale and transfer of the Target Assets and the Target Subsidiaries to
the extent necessary under applicable law to convey such assets and entities
(the "Transfer Agreements"); provided that the terms and conditions of the
Transfer Agreements are consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement except where otherwise required under applicable law.  7.3.

and to preserve for Purchaser the goodwill of the customers and suppliers of
the Business and others having business relations with Seller with respect to
the Business, and shall do all things commercially reasonable requested by
Purchaser for such purpose and consistent with Seller\'s obligations
hereunder. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall advise Purchaser as promptly as
practicable in writing of the commencement of any material suit, litigation
or legal proceeding against Seller with respect to the Business or the
Purchased Subsidiaries or with regard to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause all casualty and liability insurance coverage listed on
Schedule 8.18 to remain in effect    -26-     (or to obtain comparable
coverage) and apply all insurance proceeds in respect of casualty to the
Target Assets or assets of the Purchased Subsidiaries to the replacement or
rebuilding of such Target Assets or assets of the Purchased Subsidiaries.  
(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed in writing by

the Purchased Subsidiaries (the "Divestiture"). The Divestiture shall have
been undertaken in compliance with applicable law and in a manner that is not
adverse to any of the Purchased Subsidiaries and that does not create any
obligations on the part of any of the Purchased Subsidiaries. Prior to

undertaken in compliance with applicable law and in a manner that is not
adverse to any of the Purchased Subsidiaries and that does not create
any obligations on the part of any of the Purchased Subsidiaries.  7.16.

in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or leased or otherwise held by it or the nature of the

case of this clause (iii), for any non-qualification which does not have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Business. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means any change or effect
that, individually or taken together with all other related changes
or effects occurring prior thereto, is or is reasonably likely to be

Documents or (iii) on the ability of Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. True and complete copies of the articles of
incorporation and by-laws or other constituent documents of each member of
the Seller Group and each Purchased Subsidiary, including in   
-33-     each case all amendments thereto, have been made available in
all material respects to Purchaser. All the outstanding shares of the capital
stock of each class of each Purchased Subsidiary have been duly authorized,
validly issued and, except as set forth on Schedule 8.2, are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned, beneficially and of record by Seller or a Target
Subsidiary free and clear of any Encumbrances, and upon the delivery of any
payment for such shares at Closing as provided for herein and payment of any
stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax or other similar tax or duty (if any),
each of the Share Purchasers will acquire good and valid title thereto, free
and clear of any Encumbrances. Schedule 8.2 sets forth for each Purchased
Subsidiary the record and beneficial owners of its outstanding capital stock
or other ownership interests. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.2, none of
the Purchased Subsidiaries has issued any securities, limited liability
company interests or other ownership interests in violation of any preemptive
or similar rights and there are no outstanding (i) securities or other
ownership interests convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of
capital stock or other ownership interest of any of the
Purchased Subsidiaries; (ii) subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments, preemptive rights or other rights of any kind (absolute,
contingent or otherwise) entitling any third party to acquire or otherwise
receive from any of the Purchased Subsidiaries any shares of capital stock or
other securities or ownership interests; or (iii) contracts, commitments,
agreements, understandings or arrangements of any kind relating to the
issuance of any capital stock or ownership interests of any of the Purchased
Subsidiaries, any such convertible or exchangeable securities, or any such
subscriptions, options, warrants or rights. There are no shares of stock or
other securities, limited liability company interests or other ownership
interests of the Purchased Subsidiaries reserved for issuance for any
purpose. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not any outstanding
contractual obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates, including the
Purchased Subsidiaries, to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares
of capital stock or other ownership interest of any Purchased
Subsidiary.  8.3. CORPORATE ACTION; NO CONFLICT: The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Related Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly authorized by all requisite corporate action of Seller. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and is, and each
of the Related Documents when executed and delivered by Seller in accordance
with its terms will be, the valid and binding obligation of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except
as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally. Except as set forth in Schedule 8.3,
neither the execution, delivery or performance by Seller of this Agreement or
any of the Related Documents, nor the consummation by Seller and members of
the Seller Group of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor
compliance by Seller with any provision hereof or thereof will (i) conflict
with or result in a breach of any provision of the constitutional documents
of Seller, any member of the Seller Group or any Purchased Subsidiary; (ii)
violate any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, or any order,
writ, injunction, permit, judgment or decree of any court or other
governmental or regulatory authority (except where such violations would not,

have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business); (iii) except as would not,
or could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business, result in a breach of, or
constitute a default under (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) or

cause or give rise to any right of acceleration or termination of any
right or obligation pursuant to, or require the consent of the other party
to,    -34-     any Assigned Contract or any contract or agreement of
the Business; (iv) result in the creation of, or with the passage of time
result in the creation of, any Encumbrance upon any assets or properties of
the Business which would, or could, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Business; or (v) require the Seller, any member of the
Seller Group or any Purchased Subsidiary to obtain any consent, approval,
license, permit, order or authorization of or make any registration,
declaration or filing with any Federal, state, local or foreign government or
any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a
"Governmental Authority"), except as may be required under the HSR Act or to
obtain any Competition Approvals (as defined in Section 10.3) or except where
the failure to obtain any such consent or make any such filing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or impair the
ability of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.  8.4.

2001 and the unaudited combined balance sheet of the Business at December 31,

Business for the years ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 and the related
unaudited statements of income and cash flows of the Business for the nine
months ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Such financial statements are
collectively referred to herein as the "Financial Statements." The Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United Kingdom ("U.K. GAAP"), except that such
unaudited Financial Statements do not contain all of the footnotes required
under U.K. GAAP, but do contain comparatives and a reconciliation to
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP")
as to certain items and a description of material differences between U.K.
GAAP and U.S. GAAP as applied to the Financial Statements. The Financial
Statements, including the notes thereto, fairly present, in all material
respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Business,
as of and for the periods to which they relate. The Business has no direct or
indirect liabilities, losses or obligations of any nature, whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that (x) would be required to be reflected
on a balance sheet or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with U.K.
GAAP consistently applied and (y) that are material to the Business taken as
a whole other than (i) liabilities reflected, accrued or reserved for in
the Financial Statements; (ii) liabilities disclosed in the Schedules to
this Agreement; (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business subsequent to December 31, 2001 and not inconsistent with past

and 8.5(a)(ii), the "Owned Real Property"). Except for Permitted Liens and
the matters listed on Schedule 8.5(a)(i) (collectively, the "Permitted Owned
Real Property Exceptions"), Seller or a Purchased Subsidiary has good,
marketable and insurable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property, free
and clear of all Encumbrances. To the Knowledge of Seller, none of the
Permitted Owned Real Property Exceptions, individually or in the aggregate,
materially impairs, or could reasonably be    -35-     expected
materially to impair, the continued use and operation of the Owned
Real Property to which they relate in the conduct of the Business as
presently conducted.   (b) Schedule 8.5(b)(i) sets forth a list of all
leased real property occupied by the Purchased Subsidiaries and Schedule
8.5(b)(ii) sets forth a list of all leased real property occupied by any

case as used in, held for use in or pertaining to the Business (such
properties appearing on Schedule 8.5(b)(i) and 8.5(b)(ii), the "Leased Real
Property" and, together with the Owned Real Property, the "Real Property").
Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Business, all of the leases with respect to the Leased Real Property
(the "Leases") are in full force and effect and no member of Seller Group, or
any Purchased Subsidiary (nor, to Seller\'s Knowledge, any other party) has
received a written notice of default or termination with respect to any
Lease. All Leases constituting Target Assets are assignable without the
consent of any third party except as listed on Schedule 8.5(b)(ii) hereto or
as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Business.   (c) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Business, (i) no person is entitled to any
option, right over, interest in, right of pre-emption, first refusal,
surrender or determination relating to any of the Owned Real Property nor is
any person in the course of acquiring any of these; (ii) Seller, a member of
the Seller Group or a Purchased Subsidiary has paid all rent or license fees
which have become due in respect of any of the Leased Real Property; and
(iii) where the rent reserved by the lease or tenancy of any Leased Real
Property is subject to review, all rent review notices have been served
within any requisite time limits and there are no disputes outstanding as to
the settlement of the relevant level of rent. To the Knowledge of Seller,
neither Seller, any member of Seller Group nor any Purchased Subsidiary has
received any written notice of any subsisting breach, any non-observance of
any covenant, condition of agreement contained in the Leases on the part of
Seller, a member of the Seller Group or a Purchased Subsidiary.   (d) None
of Seller, any member of Seller Group, or any Purchased Subsidiary has
received any written, or to the Knowledge of Seller, non-written, notice
of any (i) annexation or condemnation or similar proceeding affecting all or

change or redefine the zoning classification of all or any portion of any
Real Property which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or
significantly restrict the use of that Real Property, or (iii) pending
imposition of any material special or other assessments for which Purchaser
or a Purchased Subsidiary would be responsible.   (e) Except as could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business, (i)
there is access between each Owned Real Property and public roads, and there
are no claims, suits, actions, investigations, examinations, audits,
indictments or information, or administrative, arbitration or other similar
proceedings (all of the foregoing, "Proceedings") that could have the effect
of impairing or restricting such access; and (ii) there are no material
defects in the roof, foundation, sprinkler mains, structural, mechanical, and
HVAC systems and masonry walls in any of the improvements upon each Real
Property, no significant repairs thereof are required, and all periodic
maintenance has been done and is being done consistent   
-36-     with industry maintenance standards for real property of similar
size and age in the vicinity of such Real Property.  8.6. TANGIBLE ASSETS
OTHER THAN OWNED REAL PROPERTY: Other than Owned Real Property, which is the

included within the Target Assets set forth on Schedule 1.1(a)(ii), including
the personal property acquired after the date of this Agreement, except those
sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business consistent
with Section 7.3(c)(ii) (the "Personal Property"), free and clear of all
Encumbrances, except for Permitted Liens and those tangible assets subject to
leases. Upon the delivery of any payment for such Personal Property at
Closing as provided for herein, the Business Purchasers will acquire good
and valid title thereto, free and clear of any Encumbrances except for
Permitted Liens and those tangible assets subject to Leases. All material
personal property included in the Target Assets and Purchased Subsidiaries is
in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and has
been maintained in accordance with the past practice of the Business and with
normal commercial practice in all material respects. Except for the Excluded
Assets, the Purchased Assets comprise all assets necessary to operate the
Business as presently conducted in all material respects. All material leased
personal property of the Business is in all material respects in the
condition required of such property by the terms of the lease applicable
thereto.  8.7. CONTRACTS, CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS:   (a) Schedule 8.7(a)

business;   (xiii) any contract or agreement for the sale of any Target
Asset or  asset of a Purchased Subsidiary (other than inventory sales in the

or the giving of notice or both) in default or breach in any respect under
any Material Contract except for failures to perform or defaults which do not
materially impair the ability of the Business to conduct its operations as

Material Contract is (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both) in default or breach in any respect under any Material
Contract except for failures to perform or defaults which do not materially
impair the ability of the Business to conduct its operations as heretofore

contracts available prior to Closing.   (b) All of the Material Contracts
(i) are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Business enforceable

the Purchased Subsidiaries or members of the Seller Group have received or
given written notice of any default or claimed, purported or alleged default
or state of facts which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of any party in the performance or payment
of any of the Material Contracts.   (c) A list of the ten largest customers
(in terms of revenue or turnover) and ten largest suppliers (in terms of
supplies expensed during the year) of the Business (by dollar amounts) for
the year ended March 31, 2001 is set forth in Schedule 8.7(c). Except as set

entity which is a supplier or customer of the Business (other than less than
5% of interests in publicly traded companies) or has any contractual
arrangements with the Business (other than contractual arrangements between
any Seller or any subsidiary of Seller, on one hand, and the Business, on the

and sales made by the Purchased Subsidiaries and members of the Seller Group
in connection with the Business have been made in the ordinary course
of business in accordance with past practices, and no payments have been made
to any supplier or representative thereof other than payments to such
suppliers for the payment of the invoiced price of supplies purchased in the
ordinary course of business. Except as could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or as set forth in Schedule
8.7(c), since the date of the most recent balance sheet delivered pursuant to
Section 8.4 hereof, there has not been (i) any material adverse change in the
business relationship of the Business or of any Purchased Subsidiary with any
customer or supplier named in Schedule 8.7(c) or (ii) any change in any

agreements, as the case may be, and related arrangements with any such
supplier or customer. During the past 12 months, neither the Seller, any
member of the Seller Group    -39-   nor any Purchased Subsidiary has
received any written customer complaint concerning the products and services
of the Business, nor has one of them had any such products returned by a
purchaser thereof, other than complaints and returns in the ordinary course
of business that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  8.8.
LITIGATION: Except as set forth on Schedule 8.8, there are no
Proceedings pending, or, to the Knowledge of Seller threatened, and Seller
has not received written notice of any pending investigation against Seller,
any member of the Seller Group, or any Purchased Subsidiary or the directors,
officers, agents or employees of any of them affecting the Business, Target
Assets, Purchased Subsidiaries, or Assumed Liabilities, or seeking to
prohibit or restrain the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at law
or in equity or before or by any court or other governmental agency or
instrumentality, in the United Kingdom, United States or any other
jurisdiction or any arbitral body, in each case an adverse outcome of which
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or on the ability of
Seller, in any material respect, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except as set forth on Schedule 8.8, as of the date hereof, there are
no orders, writs, injunctions or decrees currently in force which are
specific to the Business which (x) seek to prohibit or restrain the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Business or on ability of Seller, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as set forth on
Schedule 8.8, to the Knowledge of Seller, none of the Purchased Subsidiaries
is a party or subject to or in default under any judgment, order or decree
("Judgment") that is material and that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.  8.9.
COMPLIANCE WITH LAW:   (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.9, each of
Seller and the members of the Seller Group, with respect to the Business, and
the Purchased Subsidiaries is complying, in respect of its business,
operations and properties, with applicable law, except where such failure to
comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Business.   (b) Each of Seller and the members of the Seller Group, with
respect to the Business, and the Purchased Subsidiaries has duly obtained,
and hold or possesses in their name, all permits, concessions, grants,
franchises, licenses, certificates and other governmental authorizations and
approvals (collectively, "Permits") issued or granted to the Purchased
Subsidiary or included in the Target Assets. Such Permits comprise all of the
Permits necessary for the conduct of the Business, and which Permits are in
full force and effect, except for those Permits the absence of which would
not, or could not, or the failure of which to be in full force and effect
would not, or could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business. There are no
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened which may
result in the revocation, cancellation, suspension or modification of such
Permits. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business,
none of such Permits will be subject to suspension, modification, revocation
or non-renewal as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

which are the subject of Section 8.13.  8.10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:  
(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Benefit Plans" are all the material
employee benefit plans, policies and arrangements (whether or not written,
insured or self-insured), including, without limitation, each
material "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), and each other
material profit sharing, compensation, fringe benefit, health, life, stock
option, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, bonus, deferred
compensation, excess, supplemental executive compensation, cafeteria,
employee stock purchase, vacation, sabbatical, sickness, post-retirement,
disability, service award, jubilee payment, severance, change in control,
retention, individual employment, consulting, bridge pension, retirement
indemnity, collective bargaining or similar arrangements with works councils,
associations or similar organizations ("Collective Bargaining Agreements") or
other material contract plan, policy, arrangement, trust fund or agreement
established, sponsored, maintained or contributed to (or with respect to
which any obligation to contribute has been undertaken) by Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) at any time during the last six years with
respect to Business Employees or Former Employees or their beneficiaries or
with respect to which Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary could have any
primary or secondary liability; provided, however, that, for purposes of
Schedule 8.10(a), Schedule 8.10(f), Schedule 8.10(i)(i) and Schedule 8.16
only, the term "Benefit Plan" shall not include any plan (or contribution to
a plan) that is maintained by a governmental or similar agency. For purposes
of this Agreement, an "ERISA Affiliate" is any entity that would be deemed a
"single employer" with the Seller under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
or Section 4001 of ERISA. Schedule 8.10(a) lists all the Benefit Plans
covering Business Employees or Former Employees who are, or were, employed in
the United States of America (the "U.S. Benefit Plans"). Each Benefit Plan
(i) established, sponsored or maintained by or contributed to solely by one
or more Purchased Subsidiaries, (ii) established, sponsored or maintained by
or contributed to solely by one or more Purchased Subsidiaries and any other
Persons that are not Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Purchased Subsidiaries), or (iii) in which only Business Employees or Former
Employees participate or participated or are or were a participant thereto
(including, without limitation, all individual agreements) shall be herein
referred to as a "Business Benefit Plan." Each other Benefit Plan in which
Business Employees or Former Employees participate shall herein be referred
to as a "Seller Benefit Plan." As used herein, "Business Employees" shall
mean those employees of Seller or its Affiliates (i) actively employed
(including those on short-term disability or other short-term leave) by a
Purchased Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing who work wholly or
predominantly for the Business or (ii) not employed by a Purchased Subsidiary
but who, immediately prior to the Closing, work wholly or predominantly for
the Business (but excluding, in each case, any individuals on long-term
disability or layoff immediately prior to the Closing), and "Former
Employees" shall mean those individuals who, immediately prior to the
Closing, are not Business Employees and who were formerly employed by a
Purchased Subsidiary (or predecessor) or worked wholly or predominantly
for the Business at any time prior to the Closing.    -41-       (b)
Except as set forth in Schedule 8.10(b), all Business Benefit Plans have been
established and maintained in all material respects in accordance with their
respective terms and in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of law, including, without limitation, ERISA and
the Code, and, to the extent applicable, the notification and other
requirements of COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, the Newborns\' and Mothers\' Health Protection Act of 1996, the
Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, and the Women\'s Health and Cancer Rights
Act of 1998.   (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.10(c), each Business
Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is
so qualified, has received a favorable determination letter that it is so
qualified and that its trust is exempt from taxation, and there are no facts
which caused or could reasonably be expected to cause such favorable
determination letters to be revoked or the loss of qualification or
exemption. All contributions by Seller and its Affiliates for or in respect
of the members of the Business Benefit Plans which fall due for payment
before the Closing Date will have been paid by that date. Except as set forth
on Schedule 8.10(c) or as may be prohibited by law, each Business Benefit
Plan that provides welfare benefits to any Business Employee may be amended,
modified or terminated after the Closing Date except for such amendments,
modifications or terminations that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Business. Except as set forth on Schedule
8.10(c), no Business Benefit Plan that is an employee pension plan (as
defined under Section 3(2) of ERISA) provides for increased or
accelerated benefits for any group dismissal or facility closures.   (d)
Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to,
has maintained or contributed to, has been required to contribute to or has
any liability with respect to a "multi-employer plan," as such term is
defined in Section 414(f) of the Code or Sections 3(37) or 4001(a) of ERISA,
with respect to Business Employees or Former Employees.   (e) Except as set
forth on Schedule 8.10(e), no material "reportable event" within the meaning
of Section 4043(b) of ERISA has occurred that has not been waived, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement cannot
reasonably be expected to result in a reportable event, in each case,
in respect of any Business Benefit Plan. No amounts payable or benefits
provided under any Business Benefit Plan will fail to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code in
connection with, or related to, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including such transactions in combination with any other event
(such as employment termination, but not a subsequent change in control)).
Except for the U.S. Bargaining Pension Plan and the Pension Plans referred to
in Section 12.2(g), neither the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
unfunded liabilities pursuant to any Business Benefit Plan that is an
employee pension plan under Section 3(2) of ERISA.   (f) Schedule 8.10(f)
lists each Benefit Plan that is not a U.S. Benefit Plan (a "Foreign Benefit
Plan") other than individual employment or other severance agreements
involving annual payments of less than $100,000. Each Foreign Benefit Plan
that is a Business Benefit Plan (a "Foreign Business Benefit Plan") intended
to qualify as a tax-registered or tax-favored plan under a foreign
jurisdiction is the subject of a favorable determination or similar approval,
to the extent available, of the applicable foreign governmental authorities
and nothing has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that impaired or
could reasonably be expected to    -42-   impair such determination or
approval or result in the imposition of a material penalty or liability.
Seller and each Purchased Subsidiary have performed, in all material
respects, all obligations required with respect to each Foreign Business
Benefit Plan.   (g) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.10(g), all payments
required in connection with any Business Benefit Plan (including, without
limitation, all contributions, insurance premiums, or intercompany charges)
have in all material respects been made on a timely basis. Except as set
forth on Schedule 8.10(g) or contemplated under Article XII of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, in and of itself or in combination with any other event
(such as employment termination, but not a subsequent change in control),
give rise to any material liability, including, without limitation, material
liability for severance pay, material unemployment compensation, material
termination pay or withdrawal liability, or accelerate the time of payment,
funding or vesting or materially increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due to any Business Employee, Former Employees or any director of a
Purchased Subsidiary or their beneficiaries solely by reason of such
transactions. Neither the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate, or any officer
or employee thereof, has made any promises or commitments, whether legally
binding or not, to create any additional material plan, agreement, or
arrangement, or to materially modify or change any existing Benefit Plan as
it relates to the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Business, the Business
Employees or the Former Employees.   (h) With respect to each of the
Benefit Plans listed or referred to in Section 8.10(a) and 8.10(f), the
Seller has made reasonably available to Purchaser, to the extent applicable:
(i) each such written Benefit Plan and any related trust agreement, insurance
and other contract (including a policy), if any, the most recently prepared
summary plan description, if any, summary of material modifications the
substance of which is not already incorporated in the corresponding summary
plan description or Benefit Plan document, if any, and written communications
distributed to plan participants that would reasonably be expected to
materially modify the terms of any such Benefit Plan, whether through
information actually conveyed in the communication or a failure to convey
information; (ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 if such plan is
a U.S. Benefit Plan (or equivalent filing with respect to Foreign
Business Benefit Plans), with accompanying schedules and attachments, filed
with respect to each such Benefit Plan, whether maintained in the U.S. or a
Foreign Business Benefit Plan, required to make such a filing; (iii) the most
recent actuarial valuation, if any, for each Business Benefit Plan; and (iv)
the most recent favorable determination letters issued for each Business
Benefit Plan and related trust which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code or any other tax-related statute (and, if an
application for such determination is pending, a copy of the application for
such determination).   (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 8.10(i), (i) none
of the Benefit Plans promises or provides medical or other Welfare Benefits
(as defined in Section 12.2(f)) below to any Business Employee or Former
Employee (or any of their beneficiaries) after their termination of
employment other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA (hereinafter, "COBRA"), or any similar state
or non-U.S. laws; (ii) neither the Seller, any Affiliates, any other party in
interest or disqualified person (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code), has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject the Purchaser or
any    -43-     subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to a material tax,
penalty or other liability for prohibited transactions under ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code; (iii) with respect to the Business Benefit Plans, neither
the Seller nor any Affiliates, has materially breached any of the
responsibilities or obligations imposed upon Seller or any of its Affiliates
under Title I of ERISA; and (iv) other than routine claims for benefits made
in the ordinary course of the operation of the Benefit Plans as of the date
hereof, there are no pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened,
claims, investigations or causes of action with respect to any Business
Benefit Plan, whether made by a participant or beneficiary of such a plan, a
governmental agency or otherwise.   (j) Except as set forth on Schedule
8.10(j), as of the date hereof, there are no material complaints, charges or
claims against the Seller or any of its subsidiaries pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened, to be brought by or filed with any
governmental authority based on, arising out of, in connection with or
otherwise relating to the classification of any individual by the Seller or
any Purchased Subsidiary as an independent contractor or "leased employee"
(within the meaning of Section 414(n) of the Code) rather than as
an employee, and to the Knowledge of Seller no conditions exist under which
any Purchased Subsidiary or the Business is reasonably likely to incur any
such material liability.   (k) The warranties set out in Clause 2 of
Schedule 12.4(a) (United Kingdom Pensions) shall have effect as if they were
repeated in this Section 8.10(k).  8.11. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:   (a)
Schedule 8.11(a) sets forth a true, complete and correct list of all patents,
registered designs, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress,
copyrights, domain names and mask works which are used in the conduct of the
Business as currently conducted and which are issued or registered with
the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright
Office (or any other similar national intellectual property authority), or in
respect of which applications to register have been made and are pending, in
each case in the name of any of the Purchased Subsidiaries or any other
Affiliate of the Seller (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Excluded
Assets).   (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 8.11(b), Seller, the Seller
Group and the Purchased Subsidiaries are the unencumbered legal and
beneficial owners of the Seller Intellectual Property (as defined in Section
8.11(c) below) capable of transferring of the same, and, with respect to any
Seller Intellectual Property which has been issued or registered, are the
registered proprietors of the Seller Intellectual Property, and, except for
any Seller Intellectual Property which are common law unregistered marks,
copyright, design rights, trade secrets and know-how, each has taken all
steps reasonably necessary to ensure that the Seller Intellectual Property is
valid and enforceable in all jurisdictions necessary for and material to the
conduct of the Business.   (c) Except as set forth in Schedule 8.11(c)(i),
the intellectual property listed in Schedule 8.11(a) and all material common
law unregistered marks, copyright, design rights and rights in and to trade
secrets and know-how which are assets of the Purchased Subsidiaries or Target
Assets (the "Seller Intellectual Property") and all licenses, agreements,
sublicenses and permissions by which Seller, any Purchased Subsidiary or any
Affiliate of Seller of which the    -44-     Business Divisions form
part is granted the right to use any intellectual property of third parties
which is used by the Business as currently conducted are all the intellectual
property rights necessary to the conduct of the Business as presently
conducted and all such licenses, agreements, sublicenses and permissions
which are material to the conduct of the Business as currently conducted are
listed on Schedule 8.11(c)(ii).   (d) Except as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Business as currently conducted or as set forth in
Schedule 8.11(d), the products sold by the Purchased Subsidiaries, or sold in
the Business as currently conducted by the Seller Group or Seller do not
infringe, misappropriate or misuse any intellectual property rights of any
other person, and, as of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the
Seller\'s Knowledge, threatened Claim against Seller, and/or any other member
of the Seller Group (in relation to the Business as currently conducted)
and/or any Purchased Subsidiary for infringement, misappropriation or misuse
of the intellectual property of any other person and, to Seller\'s Knowledge,
there is no action or failure to inform, notify or act which would provide
the valid basis for any third party to contest the validity of any Seller
Intellectual Property or the Seller\'s, or any Purchased Subsidiary\'s, or
any other Seller Group member\'s right to use the Seller Intellectual
Property.   (e) Except as set forth in Schedule 8.11(e), neither Seller nor
any Purchased Subsidiary, nor any other Seller Group Member, has asserted
within the two years preceding the date hereof, any formal claim against any
other person that such person had violated, infringed, misappropriated or
misused, in any material respect, any Seller Intellectual Property, nor, to
the Knowledge of Seller, is there any basis for such an assertion.   (f)
Except as set forth in Schedule 8.11(f), the Affiliates of Seller of which
the Business Divisions form part and the Purchased Subsidiaries have in force
support contracts which cover all significant items of hardware and software
included in the computer equipment, software, ancillary
equipment, communications equipment, microprocessors, firmware, operating
software, routers and servers, in each case used by such Affiliates in
relation to the Business as currently conducted and/or the Purchased
Subsidiaries and which are material to the conduct of the Business as
currently conducted (the "Computer Systems").   (g) Except as set forth in
Schedule 8.11(g), the Business Divisions and the Purchased Subsidiaries have
taken commercially reasonable and prudent precautions to preserve the
availability, confidentiality, security and integrity of data held or
transmitted by the Computer Systems (including without limitation) the use of

(h) Except as set forth in Schedule 8.11(h) and except as would not have
a Material Adverse Effect, in the one year preceding the date of this
Agreement, neither the performance nor the functionality of the Computer
Systems has been affected by any date recognition problem relating to the
processing of dates before, on and after January 1, 2000.  8.12. ABSENCE OF

Business, nor any Purchased Subsidiary has:   (i) except as otherwise

notice, report or other written information regarding any actual or alleged
violation of Environmental Laws, or any Environmental Liabilities, including,
without limitation, any investigatory, remedial or corrective obligations, in
each case relating to the Business, the Target Assets or the Purchased
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Environmental
Liabilities" shall mean any suits, claims, judgments, damages (including
punitive damages), losses, penalties, fines, liabilities, encumbrances,

offers of employment at an equivalent base salary or wage level to
all Business Employees not employed by a Purchased Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to continue to

Subsidiary who accept Purchaser\'s offer of employment and commence active
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be considered "Transferred
Employees" hereunder as of the Closing; provided that a Business Employee not
employed by a Purchased Subsidiary shall not be considered a Transferred
Employee until the date such Business Employee reports to active employment
with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, which must in any case occur within
180 calendar days after the Closing.   (b) For one year after the Closing,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Purchased Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to provide employee benefits (including, without limitation, medical and
dental benefits) to Transferred Employees that in the aggregate are
substantially similar to those benefits provided by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to its similarly situated employees and such other terms and
conditions of employment as may be required by applicable law. Subject to the
obligations of Seller and its Affiliates under Section 12.4, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to, assume, honor and/or continue
to perform all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates under all Business
Benefit Plans and Collective Bargaining Agreements in   
-58-     accordance with their terms. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
each of the Purchased Subsidiaries to, waive any pre-existing condition
exclusions (except with respect to conditions excluded from coverage under
the Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date by reason of being
considered excluded pre-existing conditions thereunder) and actively at work
requirements and provide that any expenses incurred on or before the Closing
Date by a Transferred Employee or a Transferred Employee\'s covered dependent
shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions if such amounts are
applicable to the same calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, in
each case, under any applicable welfare plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates,
provided that such information is provided to Purchaser within 60 days
following the Closing Date.   (c) With regard to Transferred Employees who
performed at least one year of service with Seller or a Purchased Subsidiary
prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall cause each employee benefit plan or
compensation arrangement established, maintained or contributed to by
Purchaser or its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employee participates
to grant any such Transferred Employee credit for all service with Seller or
a Purchased Subsidiary, as applicable, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (and not for benefit accrual purposes) with respect to any employee
pension benefit plan as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or any similar
foreign benefit plan, and for purposes of eligibility and determining the
amount of any benefit with respect to any vacation program and any employee
welfare benefit plan as defined in Section 3(1) of the Code or any similar
foreign benefit plan (including, without limitation, Purchaser\'s or
its Affiliate\'s severance plans and policies in effect from time to
time).   (d) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].   (e) Seller and its Affiliates
shall remain solely responsible after the Closing for all liabilities in
respect of severance, redundancy and similar pay, salary continuation, and
similar obligations arising under any Benefit Plan relating to the
termination or alleged termination of any Business Employee\'s or Former
Employee\'s employment with Seller and its Affiliates on or prior to
the Closing Date, except to the extent that such liability arises solely as a
result of Purchaser\'s failure to comply with its obligations under this
Section 12.2. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all liabilities in
respect of severance, redundancy and similar pay, salary continuation, and
similar obligations relating to the termination or alleged termination under
any Business Benefit Plan of any Transferred Employee\'s employment occurring
after the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
restricting or limiting the right or ability of Purchaser or its Affiliates
to terminate the employment of Transferred Employees after the Closing.  
(f) Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible after the
Closing for (i) claims for the type of benefits described in Section 3(1) of
ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA) ("Welfare Benefits") that are
incurred under any Benefit Plan by or with respect to any Business Employee
or Former Employee before the Closing Date (provided that Seller shall only
be responsible for medical and healthcare benefits described in this clause
(f)(i) to the extent such benefits exceed $1,500,000), and (ii) claims
relating to COBRA coverage under any Benefit Plan attributable to "qualifying
events" that occur before the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall be solely responsible after the Closing for (X) claims for Welfare
Benefits that are incurred by or with respect to any Business Employee on or
after the Closing Date (Y) up to    -59-     the first $1,500,000 of
medical and healthcare benefits incurred before the Closing Date under any
Benefit Plan by or with respect to any Business Employee or Former Employee,
and (Z) claims relating to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events"
with respect to any Transferred Employee that occur after the date such
individual becomes a Transferred Employee hereunder. For purposes of the
foregoing, a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred when
the services are rendered or the supplies are provided, and not when the
condition arose.   (g) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume and/or
continue to be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Seller and its
Affiliates harmless against, any and all obligations and liabilities that
arise under any Benefit Plan that provides pension, early retirement or
similar benefits (including, but not limited to, TFR in Italy and long
service jubilee benefits) to Business Employees and/or Former Employees in
Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom (but
in the United Kingdom, only in respect of Business Employees). Schedule
12.4(a) shall govern the transfer of assets and liabilities with respect to
the Benefit Plans that provide pension or early retirement benefits to
Business Employees in the United Kingdom.   (h) Prior to May 30, 2002,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will permit any Business Employee
that currently participates in the Invensys Executive Bonus Plan 2001/2002 to
become a participant in or enter into any new plan or arrangement that
provides for any performance based bonus or award without the consent of
Purchaser, unless required by law or an existing agreement. With respect to
all other Business Employees, Purchaser shall have the right to consult with
Seller prior to Seller or any of its Affiliates establishing or adopting any
new plan or arrangement that provides for any performance based bonus or
award, except for any plan or arrangement required by law or existing
agreement. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates for all bonuses
payable to Business Employees and Former Employees in respect of
any performance period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller and its Affiliates for all bonuses payable to Business Employees
and Former Employees in respect of any performance period beginning after
March 31, 2002.   (i) Sellers shall take such action as is necessary to
vest on the Closing Date all outstanding stock options or other equity-based
awards held by, or granted to, Business Employees and to permit Business
Employees to exercise such awards during a period of no less than 30 days
after the Closing Date (or such longer period specified by the applicable
plan). Sellers shall be responsible for any and all payments, withholding and
reporting obligations that arise on or after the Closing Date related to such
stock options or other stock awards.  12.3. U.S. EMPLOYEES: For purposes of
this Section 12.3, "U.S. Business Employees" and "U.S. Transferred Employees"
means all Business Employees and Transferred Employees, respectively,
employed primarily within the United States.   (a) The Invensys Pension
Plan (the "U.S. Salaried Pension Plan") covers substantially all non-
represented U.S. Business Employees and certain Former Employees. Effective
as of the Closing Date, all U.S. Business Employees who have completed at
least one year of service    -60-     as of the Closing Date shall (i)
be vested in their accrued benefit earned through the Closing Date under the
U.S. Salaried Pension Plan and any non-qualified retirement plan (such as an
excess or supplemental plan) (a "Non-Qualified Plan"), and (ii) be eligible
for a normal, early or deferred vested retirement benefit under the U.S.
Salaried Pension Plan and any Non-Qualified Plan based upon such U.S.
Business Employees having terminated active participation under the plan on
the Closing Date, and such U.S. Business Employee\'s age and years of service
under the plan as of that date. Distribution of the normal, early or deferred
vested retirement benefit accrued by any U.S. Business Employee, including
without limitation, the time of benefit payment and the form in which the
benefit is payable, shall be determined in accordance with the applicable
terms of the U.S. Salaried Pension Plan and any Non-Qualified Plan. Purchaser
shall not have any liability with respect to the U.S. Salaried Pension Plan
or any Non-Qualified Plan.   (b) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
adopt and become the successor sponsor of the Edwards Valve, Inc. Pension
Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees (the "U.S. Bargaining Pension Plan"). As
of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall assume all of Seller\'s and its
Affiliate\'s liabilities and obligations with respect to the U.S. Bargaining
Pension Plan, including without limitation all obligations to make
contributions required to be made to the U.S. Bargaining Pension Plan.
Purchaser shall execute such documents as may be reasonably requested by
Seller to effect such adoption and assumption. Seller shall cause the trustee
of the master trust in which the U.S. Bargaining Pension Plan participates
(the "Master Trust"), as of the Master Trust\'s valuation date next following
the Closing Date (the "Valuation Date"), to value, in a manner consistent
with its prior practice, the U.S. Bargaining Pension Plan\'s allocable share
of the assets of the Master Trust (the "U.S. Bargaining Plan Asset Value").
As soon as practicable after the determination of the U.S. Bargaining Plan
Asset Value, Seller shall cause the trustee of the Master Trust to
transfer to a successor trustee designated by Purchaser an amount in cash or
other property mutually agreeable to Seller and Purchaser equal to the U.S.
Bargaining Plan Asset Value (i) increased by interest during the period from
the Valuation Date to the date of transfer (the "Interim Period") at a rate
of 5% per annum (the "Interest Rate") and (ii) reduced by (A) benefit
payments to employees or their beneficiaries made in accordance with the
provisions of the U.S. Bargaining Pension Plan during the Interim Period plus
interest on such benefit payments at the Interest Rate from the date of
payment until the transfer date and (B) an allocable share of fees and
expenses incurred by the Master Trust during the Interim Period; provided,
however, that no transfer pursuant to this Section 12.3(b) shall be made
until the Purchaser provides satisfactory evidence in the form of a favorable
determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion
letter of counsel reasonably acceptable to Seller that the successor trust
related to the U.S. Bargaining Pension Plan satisfies after the Closing Date
the requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, which
evidence Purchaser shall provide to Seller within 60 days after the Closing
Date.   (c) The accounts under the Invensys 401(k) Plan (the "Investment
Plan") of all Business Employees who participate in such Investment Plan on
the Closing Date shall be fully vested as of the Closing Date and shall be
distributable according to the terms of such plan. Seller acknowledges that
on and after the Closing Date the account balances of such Business Employees
shall be distributable from such Investment Plan in accordance with Section
401(k)(2) of the Code. Purchaser will cause a retirement plan maintained by
Purchaser intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and which
contains a cash or deferred feature under    -61-     Section 401(k)
of the Code ("Purchaser 401(k) Plan") to accept direct rollovers pursuant to
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code of distributions from the Investment Plan to
Transferred Employees to the extent permitted by law (including
direct rollovers of such Transferred Employees\' outstanding loans and any
promissory notes or other documents evidencing such loans). Seller also
agrees to facilitate the continued repayment of participant loans into the
Investment Plan by Transferred Employees until such Transferred Employees
become eligible to participate in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan. Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate with each other (and cause the trustees of the
Investment Plan and Purchaser 401(k) Plan to cooperate with each other) with
respect to the rollover of the distributions to the participants.   (d) The
accounts under the Seller\'s Flexible Benefits Program of all Business
Employees who participate in such plan on the Closing Date shall be available
according to the terms of such plan for the reimbursement of eligible claims
incurred while the Business Employee was covered under the plan.   (e)
Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any and all liability for post-
retirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations to all Transferred
Employees under any U.S. Benefit Plans. Nothing herein shall preclude the
Purchaser from amending any employee benefit plan providing welfare benefits
to Transferred Employees following the Closing. Seller shall continue to be
solely responsible for, and shall indemnify Purchaser from and against, any
and all liability for post-retirement medical and life insurance
benefit obligations to all Former Employees under any U.S. Benefit
Plans.  12.4. ALLOCATION OF EMPLOYEE LIABILITIES GENERALLY:   (a) Except
as explicitly set forth in or otherwise explicitly provided in this Article
XII and for liabilities specifically included in the Restructuring Provision,
Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible after the Closing for,
and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless against,
any and all obligations and liabilities: (i) explicitly assumed or retained
by Seller or its Affiliates in this Article XII, (ii) that have arisen or may
arise under or in connection with any Seller Benefit Plan, (iii) that have
arisen or may arise in connection with or related to any current or
former employee of Seller or its Affiliates who is not considered a Business
Employee or Former Employee hereunder, (iv) that have arisen or may arise in
connection with a Business Employee or Former Employee that is related
primarily to a period prior to the Closing during which such individual was
employed wholly or predominately with the Seller or one of its Affiliates
other than with the Business, (v) relating to retirement benefits provided to
Former Employees or retirement or early retirement benefits accrued as of the
Closing Date with respect to Business Employees, or (vi) relating to any
retention bonuses that may become payable to any individual listed in items
A1 through A12 listed on Schedule 8.10(g) under any agreements between Seller
or its Affiliates and such individuals that are in effect at the Closing and
(v) related to the failure of Seller or its Affiliates to comply with any
employee notification or consultation requirements of applicable law (unless
such failure is caused by the failure of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to (i) reasonably cooperate with, or provide requested information
to, the Seller in connection with its efforts to comply with such law or (ii)
a failure by Purchaser to comply with any employee notification or
consultation requirements of applicable law). In addition, Seller and its
Affiliates shall be solely responsible    -62-     for any and all
Controlled Group Liabilities. "Controlled Group Liabilities" are any and all
liabilities (A) under Title IV of ERISA, (B) under Section 302 of ERISA, (C)
under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, and/or (D) as a result of a failure
to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq.
of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or the group health plan requirements
of sections 701 et seq. of the Code and Section 701 et seq. of ERISA, in each
case relating to any employee benefit plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate.   (b) Except as explicitly
set forth in or otherwise explicitly provided in this Article XII, Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for and shall indemnify and
hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless against any and all obligations and
liabilities: (i) that arise under any benefit plan of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including Business Benefit Plans after the Closing), (ii) that
have arisen or may arise in connection with, or that are related to, the
employment of a Business Employee or Former Employee, whether prior to, on or
after the Closing Date and (iii) caused by Purchaser\'s violation of this
Article XII.  12.5. SOUTH AFRICAN EMPLOYEES: With effect from the Closing,
Invensys South Africa (Proprietary) Limited hereby transfers to the Business
Purchaser designated by Purchaser, as contemplated in section 197 of the
Labour Relations Act, No. 66 of 1995 ("LRA"), all the contracts of employment
of the Business Employees employed by Invensys South Africa (Proprietary)
Limited (the "South African Employees"), on the same terms and conditions as
those pertaining to the South African Employees as of the Closing. The
parties agree that no agreements contemplated in section 197(3) of the LRA
have been or will be concluded. With respect to the Target Assets of Invensys
South Africa (Proprietary) Limited, the parties further agree that, for all
purposes of federal and local law of South Africa, the transactions
contemplated hereby shall constitute a sale as a going concern. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall use their respective reasonable best endeavors to
procure that the Purchaser or a Purchaser designee is substituted, with
effect from the Closing Date, for all purposes as the participating employer
in the place of Invensys SA (Pty) Ltd in relation to the Orion Money Purchase
Provident Fund and the Orion Money Purchase Pension Fund, and the Purchaser
hereby indemnifies the Seller accordingly.  12.6. U.K. EMPLOYEES:   (a) In
this Section 12.6 "U.K. Business Employees" mean individuals employed wholly
or predominantly in the Flow Control division of BTR Industries Limited.  
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (the
"Regulations") will apply to the transfer of the flow control division of BTR
Industries Limited under this Agreement, so that the contracts of employment
of the U.K. Business Employees (except in respect of terms relating to
occupational pension arrangements) will have effect from the Closing Date as
if originally made between the Business Purchasers and the U.K. Business
Employees. In the event that the provisions of the Regulations conflict with
the provisions of Article 12.2, the provisions of Article 12.6 shall
prevail.    -63-      (c) (i) If for any reason the contract of
employment of any employee of BTR Industries Limited who is not a U.K.
Business Employee is found or alleged to have effect after the Closing Date
as if originally made with the Business Purchasers, the Seller, in
consultation with the Business Purchasers, will, within 14 days of being so
requested by the Business Purchasers, make to that person an offer in writing
to employ him under a new contract of employment, to take effect upon the
termination referred to in clause (ii) herein, identical in all respects to
that person\'s contract of employment immediately before the Closing Date.
However, the Business Purchasers must make the request no later than 15 days
after becoming aware of the finding or allegation.   (ii) Once that offer
has been made (or after the expiry of 14 days after it has been requested),
the Business Purchasers may terminate the employment of the person concerned
and, so long as that termination is effected within four months after the
Closing Date, the Seller will indemnify the Business Purchasers against the
costs of that person\'s employment, the termination of that employment or any
costs resulting from such termination and any liabilities or costs relating
to that person, or to any person who is alleged to have transferred.   (d)
(i) If the contract of employment of any U.K. Business Employee is found or
alleged not to have effect after the Closing Date as if originally made with
the Business Purchasers, other than by virtue of Regulation 5(4A) of
the Regulations, the Business Purchasers, in consultation with the Seller,
will, within 14 days of being so requested by the Seller, make to that
Business Employee an offer in writing to employ him under a new contract of
employment, to take effect upon the termination referred to in clause (ii)
herein, on terms and conditions which (other than the identity of the
employer and any terms and conditions relating to an occupational pension
scheme) will not differ from the corresponding provisions of the U.K.
Business Employee\'s contract of employment immediately before the Closing
Date. However, the Seller must make the request no later than 15 days after
the Seller becomes aware of such finding or allegation.   (ii) Once that
offer has been made (or after the expiry of 14 days after it has been
requested), the Seller shall terminate the employment of the U.K. Business
Employee concerned and, so long as that termination is effected within four
months after the Closing Date, the Business Purchasers shall indemnify the
Seller against the costs of that U.K. Business Employee\'s employment and its
termination.   (e) The Business Purchasers shall indemnify the Seller
against any claim in respect of the employment of any U.K. Transferred
Employee during the period after the Closing Date including, without
limitation, (i) any changes to terms and conditions of employment by the
Business Purchasers; (ii) any termination of the employment of any U.K.
Transferred Employee by the Business Purchasers after the Closing Date; and
(iii) any failure by the Business Purchasers to comply with its obligations
under Regulation 10(3) of the Regulations.   (f) The Seller shall indemnify
the Purchaser against any liabilities, claims, losses, costs and expenses the
Purchaser may incur as a result of the Seller\'s failure to inform and
consult in accordance with Regulation 10 of the Regulations.  12.7.
AUSTRALIAN SUPERANNUATION ARRANGEMENTS:    -64-      (a) Unless
otherwise provided for in this Section 12.7, Sections 12.4(a), 12.2(f) and
(g), shall not apply in respect of any Benefit Plan to which Invensys Flow
Control Australasia Pty Ltd. ("IFC Australasia") contributes, or any other
superannuation arrangements or obligations of IFC Australasia ("Australian
Superannuation Arrangements").   (b) Any provision of this Agreement
applicable to a Benefit Plan and which refers to a law of the United States
of America, or to any other jurisdiction other than Australia, does not apply
with respect to the Australian Superannuation Arrangements to the extent of
that reference.   (c) Schedule 8.10(f) lists each Australian Superannuation
Arrangement which is a Foreign Benefit Plan ("Australian Benefit Plan").  
(d) None of the Purchaser, the Target Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates shall adopt or become a sponsoring employer of the
Invensys Australia Superannuation Fund.   (e) Where an employee of IFC
Australasia who will continue in employment with IFC Australasia after the
Closing Date ("Australian Business Employee") is a member of the Invensys
Australia Superannuation Fund or another superannuation arrangement to which
the Purchaser is not permitted to contribute after the Closing Date
("Previous Fund"):   (i) the Purchaser shall use its best endeavours to
ensure that, as  soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, it
makes  arrangements for that Australian Business Employee to become a member
of an  alternative superannuation fund ("Purchaser\'s Fund") which will
provide for  that Australian Business Employee benefits which are no less
favourable  than those conferred by the Previous Fund, where the previous
Fund is a  defined contribution plan. If the Previous Fund is a defined
benefit plan,  the Purchaser\'s fund will provide retirement benefits
comparable to its  similarly situated employees of Purchaser. The Purchaser
must ensure that  the Purchaser\'s Fund will be a "Complying Fund" as defined
under the  Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and that the
Purchaser\'s  Fund otherwise complies with all applicable statutory
requirements;   (ii) the Purchaser shall make superannuation contributions
from the  Closing Date in respect of the Australian Business Employee to
the  Purchaser\'s Fund at the applicable rate so as not to incur a
superannuation  guarantee charge liability under the Superannuation Guarantee
Charge Act  1992 (Commonwealth of Australia);   (iii) the Seller and
Purchaser must, as soon as reasonably practicable  after the Closing Date,
use their respective best endeavours to procure  that the trustee of the
Previous Fund provides the Australian Business  Employee with the option of
transferring their benefit entitlements, as  determined under the trust deed
of each Previous Fund ("Benefit  Entitlements") to the Purchaser\'s Fund. The
Benefit Entitlements in respect  of a defined benefit plan member will be an
amount determined by an actuary  to be equitable in accordance with the trust
deed of the Previous Fund;   (iv) the Seller must use its best endeavours to
procure the payment  from the Previous Fund to the Purchaser\'s Fund of the
Benefit Entitlements  of any Business    -65-      Employee who
elects (in accordance with the applicable trust deed) to  transfer their
Benefit Entitlement to the Purchaser\'s Fund. Unless  otherwise provided for
in the applicable Previous Fund trust deed, Benefit  Entitlements are to be
calculated as at the date of payment; and   (v) for the avoidance of doubt,
it is expressly acknowledged and  agreed that if a Business Employee who is a
member of a Previous Fund does  not elect to transfer his or her Benefit
Entitlement to the Purchaser\'s  Fund, his or her Benefit Entitlement will be
dealt with in accordance with  the trust deed of their Previous Fund.   (f)
Where sub-clause (e) above does not apply, the Purchaser shall ensure that
from the Closing Date, it makes superannuation contributions in respect
of the Australian Business Employees to the same superannuation funds to
which the Seller was contributing immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Such contributions shall be made at the applicable rate so as not to incur
a superannuation guarantee charge liability under the Superannuation
Guarantee Charge Act 1992 (Commonwealth of Australia).   (g) The Purchaser
shall provide Australian Business Employees with information about the
matters set out in this Section 12.7 to enable them to understand the
superannuation arrangements made by the Purchaser with respect to the
Australian Business Employees after the Closing Date.  12.8. SWEDEN: As of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume the liability and obligation to
secure NAF Industries AB\'s repayment to FPG,
Forsakringsbolaget Pensionsgaranti Omsesidigta of any amounts which FPG may
pay relating to NAF Industries AB\'s pension commitments and that are covered
by credit insurance issued by FPG. The liability and obligation is presently
secured by Invensys plc by a surety bond issued to FPG on December 21, 2001
and to which Section 15.6 thus shall apply.   ARTICLE XIII.  Obligations
After Closing  13.1. ACCESS: In connection with any of the Retained
Liabilities or any financial audit of Seller or any Claim or governmental
investigation of Seller for any matter relating to any period prior to the
Closing, or for any other reasonable and lawful purpose, Purchaser shall,
upon request, permit Seller and its representatives to have access, at
reasonable times during normal business hours and in a manner which is not
unreasonably disruptive to the operations of Purchaser, to the operating
records, data and other materials maintained by or on behalf of the Business,
including, without limitation, production data, engineering records,
personnel and payroll records, manufacturing and quality control records and
procedures, research and development files, intellectual property disclosures
and accounting records, customer lists and records, supplier lists and
records, and other materials relating to the foregoing items (the "Purchased
Records") and work papers, books and records of Purchaser relating to the
Business. Purchaser shall maintain in an orderly manner, and shall not
dispose of, the Purchased Records or such work papers, books and records
during the six-year period beginning with the Closing Date without Seller\'s
prior written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Following the expiration of such six-year period, Purchaser
may dispose of the    -67-     Purchased Records or such work papers,
books and records at any time upon giving 90 calendar days prior written
notice to Seller, unless Seller agrees to take possession thereof within such
90 calendar days at no expense to Purchaser. After the Closing, upon
reasonable written notice, Seller and Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other and their affiliates and their respective employees,
counsel, auditors and representatives access, at reasonable times during
normal business hours and in a manner which is not unreasonably disruptive to
the operations of the other party, to such information and assistance
relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries and the Target Assets (to the extent
within the control of such party) as is reasonably necessary for financial
reporting and accounting matters.  13.2. FURTHER ASSURANCES: From time to
time after the Closing, without further consideration, the parties shall
cooperate with each other and shall execute and deliver instruments of
transfer or assignment, or such other documents to the other party as such
other party reasonably may request to evidence or perfect Purchaser\'s right,
title and interest to the Target Assets, the Purchased Subsidiaries and the
assets of the Purchased Subsidiaries, and otherwise carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the provisions
of this Section 13.2, to the extent that Purchaser and/or any Purchased
Subsidiary discover any additional intellectual property which should have
been transferred to Purchaser as Seller Intellectual Property, Seller shall,
and shall procure that the relevant member(s) of Seller Group
shall, cooperate with Purchaser and execute and deliver any instruments of
transfer or assignment reasonably necessary to transfer and assign such
intellectual property to Purchaser and/or the relevant Purchased Subsidiary,
and Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all costs relating to the
preparation and the filing or other recordation of any such instruments of
transfer or assignment. Without limiting the provisions of this Section 13.2,
to the extent that Seller discovers any intellectual property which does not
constitute Seller Intellectual Property and/or which was inadvertently or
otherwise mistakenly transferred to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser or
retained with a Purchased Subsidiary and/or which is an Excluded Asset which
is inadvertently or otherwise mistakenly transferred to Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser or retained with a Purchased Subsidiary as Seller
Intellectual Property, Purchaser or the Purchased Subsidiary, as appropriate,
shall, and shall procure that the relevant Affiliates of Purchaser shall,
cooperate with Seller and execute and deliver any instruments of transfer or
assignment reasonably necessary to transfer and assign such intellectual
property back to Seller or the Affiliate of Seller which Seller designates,
or otherwise re-vest in Seller or its designated Affiliate title to such
intellectual property.  13.3. POST-CLOSING COOPERATION:   (a) Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate with each other, and shall cause their affiliates
and their officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to
cooperate with each other, for a period of 180 days after the Closing to
ensure the orderly transition of the Business from the Seller Group to
Purchaser and to minimize any disruption to the Business and the
other respective businesses of Seller and Purchaser that might result from
the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Each party shall reimburse the
other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting
the other pursuant to this Section 13.3. Neither party shall be required by
this Section 13.3 to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with
the    -67-     conduct of its business or unreasonably disrupt its
normal operations (or, in the case of Purchaser, those of the
Business).  13.4. REQUIRED ACCESS. In connection with the indemnification
obligations of Seller set forth in Section 16.6 of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of Seller to provide timely,
appropriate and reasonable access to Seller (or its designees, including any
parties necessary for Seller to comply with the terms of any indemnification
agreements which are referred to in Sections 1.2(i), 1.2(j) and 1.2(k) and
Schedule 1.2) to the Purchaser\'s property, business records, employees, and
data and agrees to enter into mutually acceptable access agreements in
connection therewith.   ARTICLE XIV.  Notices   All notices, consents,

representatives by Seller and its Affiliates, agents and representatives is
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement the terms of which are hereby
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that
Purchaser acknowledges that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
only with respect to information provided to any of Purchaser and
its Affiliates, agents or representatives that relates to the Business or
otherwise is used in the ordinary course of business of the Business; and
provided further, however, that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all
information provided or made available to any of it and its Affiliates,
agents and representatives by or on behalf of the Sellers (other than
information relating to Purchased    -69-   Assets or the Business)
shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality

Seller Information (as defined below) confidential following the Closing
Date, except that any such Seller Information required by law or legal or

technical, business and financial information, other than information that
relates to the Business or the Purchased Assets or otherwise is used in the
ordinary course of business of the Business and other than any

Information.  15.4. INSURANCE:   (a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that upon Closing all insurance coverage provided in relation to the Business
pursuant to policies maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Purchased Subsidiaries) (whether such policies are maintained with third
party insurers or with Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Purchased
Subsidiaries)) shall cease and no further liability shall arise under any
such policies that are "claims made" basis policies but (subject to the terms
of any relevant policy) without prejudice to any accrued claims which the
Purchased Subsidiaries or any member of the Seller Group (in the latter case
in relation to the Business) may have at Closing, provided that the Business
shall retain the benefit of "occurrence" based policies of insurance in
relation to events occurring prior to Closing but in respect of which no
claim has at Closing crystallized.   (b) Purchaser and Seller agree that any
claims made under the insurance policies referred to in Section 15.4(a) in
respect of the Business shall be administered and collected by Seller (or by
a claims handler appointed by Seller) on behalf of Purchaser. Seller agrees
to diligently pursue all such claims on behalf of Purchaser. Purchaser shall
cooperate fully with Seller to enable Seller to comply with the requirements
of the relevant insurer, and Purchaser    -70-     shall provide such
information and assistance as Seller may reasonably request in connection
with any such claim. Any monies received by Seller as a result of such claim
shall be paid over to Purchaser, net of all reasonable costs and expenses of
recovery (including, without limitation, all reasonable out-of-pocket
handling and collection fees charged by any claims handler appointed by
Seller) no later than 20 Business Days following the receipt of same into
Seller\'s bank account.   (c) In respect of all claims under the insurance
policies referred to in Section 15.4(b) notified to insurers at the date of
this Agreement and all claims subsequently brought under such insurance
policies and relating to the Business, Purchaser acknowledges that it shall
be responsible for the deductible on each relevant insurance policy and will
not be entitled to seek payment of such deductible from Seller. Purchaser
shall reimburse Seller within 20 Business Days after receipt of the invoice
for any deductible paid by Seller (including evidence of such payment) after
the Closing Date with respect to claims made under the insurance policies
referred to in Section 15.4(b) to the extent such deductible has been paid by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, or, if Purchaser is invoiced directly by the
insurance company for such deductible amount, it shall pay or cause such
invoice to be paid within 20 Business Days.  15.5. NON-SOLICITATION OF
EMPLOYEES: Neither Seller, nor any of its Affiliates, for itself or on behalf
of any other person, will induce any Transferred Employees who remain and are
at the time employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates, to terminate his or her
relationship with Purchaser. Neither Purchaser or any of its Affiliates nor
the Business will induce any employee of Seller\'s remaining businesses to
leave his or her employment. These reciprocal obligations shall continue for
a period of two years from the date hereof, except as the parties may
otherwise agree. The use of an independent employment agency (so long as it
is not directed by Seller or Purchaser or their Affiliates, as applicable, to
solicit such employees) or newspaper advertising and the hiring as a result
thereof of any employee shall not be construed as a breach of this
Agreement.  15.6. RELEASE OF GUARANTEES: Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Purchaser to be substituted in all respects for
Seller and/or its Affiliates that are not Purchased Subsidiaries and will use
its best efforts to cause Seller and/or its Affiliates that are not Purchased
Subsidiaries, to be released and fully discharged from, any responsibility or
liability in respect of any obligation under any guarantees no later than 30
days after the Closing Date. Whether or not Purchaser is able to effect any
such a substitution, release, or discharge, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser, and not Seller or its Affiliates, will be solely responsible for
performances and payment of all obligations of Seller and/or its Affiliates
in respect of such guarantees.  15.7. SETTLEMENT OF INTER-COMPANY TRADING
ACCOUNTS: After the Closing Date, all Inter-Company Trading Accounts open
between the Business, on one hand, and the Seller and/or its Affiliates
(other than any Purchased Subsidiaries), on the other hand, as of the Closing
Date will be settled in accordance with the terms in effect as of the Closing
Date or, if no such terms are specified, then within 30 days after the
Closing Date. "Inter-Company Trading Accounts" means trading accounts entered
into by the Business in the ordinary course with Seller or its Affiliates
(other than any Purchased Subsidiaries) relating to the provision of goods or
services by, to, or for the benefit of the Business.    -71-     15.8.
TRANSFER OF NOMINAL SHARES: With respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries as to
which directors or other nominees of Seller or its Affiliates own shares
of capital stock of any of the Purchased Subsidiaries for purposes of
satisfying requirements of applicable law, Seller and Purchaser shall take
all necessary or appropriate action to effect the transfer of such shares to
new directors or other nominees designated by Purchaser as, when and to the
extent permitted by applicable law.  15.9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: As
promptly as is reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
take such steps as are necessary to change the name of any Purchased
Subsidiary whose name includes a Retained Name. Purchaser Designees and their
Affiliates (including, without limitation, Purchaser and the Purchased
Subsidiaries) shall have the right to sell inventory included in the Target
Assets and the Purchased Subsidiaries containing the Retained Names in the
ordinary course and to use existing marketing and sales material
with appropriate stickering for a period of six months after the Closing Date
so long as no modifications are made to the inventory and the stickering is
approved in advance by Seller, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Purchaser, Purchaser Designees and their Affiliates
irrevocably and perpetually consent to the use and continued registration by
Seller, Seller Group and their affiliates, of the trademarks set out in
Schedule 15.9 and their use and registration of, including the filing of any
additional applications for registration of, the mark "Argus" in relation to
or in connection with the following products within international classes 7
and 9 (and corresponding national and/or local classes): motors (of all types
including without limitation electric motors), machines and all equipment
therefore and components thereof. Purchaser, Purchaser Designees and their
Affiliates shall not challenge, oppose, or seek to cancel, nor assist any
third party in taking any of the foregoing actions with regard to, such use,
filing of applications to register, and registration of the "Argus" mark. All
of Seller\'s, Seller Group\'s and their affiliates\' rights hereunder in
relation to the use and registration of the "Argus" mark shall be fully and
freely assignable by Seller, Seller Group, and their affiliates, and shall
inure to the benefit of such assignees.   ARTICLE XVI.  Survival of
Representations and Warranties and Indemnification  16.1. SURVIVAL: Except
for (i) the representations and warranties of Seller in Sections 8.1, 8.2,
8.3 and 8.5(a) and the first sentence of Section 8.6 and the representations
and warranties of Purchaser in Sections 9.1 and 9.3, which will survive
indefinitely and (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 8.15,
which are governed solely by Article XVII, the representations and warranties
in this Agreement and in any other document delivered in connection herewith
shall survive the Closing until 24 months after the Closing Date. Neither
party shall have an indemnification obligation with respect to
any indemnification claim asserting a breach of a representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement if such claim is made after the end of
the applicable survival period. The covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement (except for those contained in Article XVII, which are
governed solely by Article XVII) shall survive in accordance with their
respective terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Seller\'s indemnification obligations under Section 16.6
shall terminate (i) with respect to the breach of any representation and
warranty set forth in Section 8.13, on the second anniversary of the Closing
Date and (ii) with respect to all other obligations under Section 16.6, on
the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
the    -73-     Seller\'s obligations with respect to the Retained
Liabilities (except for Taxes, which are governed solely by Article XVII) and
other liabilities retained by Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
without limitation.  16.2. INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER:   (a) From and after
the Closing Date, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees (including their successors, assigns
and transferees, if any) and their respective directors, shareholders,
officers, employees, agents, consultants, representatives, Affiliates,
successors and assigns from and against any and all loss, liability, damage
or expense (including reasonable attorney and consultant\'s fees
and expenses, collectively "Losses") arising out of (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement (except
those contained in Section 8.13, which are governed by Sections 16.1 and
16.6, and Section 8.15, which are governed solely by Article XVII), (ii)
Seller\'s obligations under Section 16.6, (iii) Seller\'s failure to pay or
satisfy or cause to be paid or satisfied (A) any of the Retained Liabilities
or (B) any liability retained by Seller pursuant to Article XII when due or
payable; or (iv) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement
of Seller contained herein or in any other document executed and delivered at
the Closing (except, in each case, those relating to Taxes, which are
governed solely by Article XVII).   (b) The amount of any Losses incurred
by Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees shall be reduced (i) by the net
amount Purchaser and the Purchaser Designees recover (after deducting all
attorneys\' fees, expenses and other costs of recovery), from any insurer or
other third party liable for such Losses and (ii) where and to the extent the
obligation giving rise to any such Losses was specifically included in the
determination of Net Book Value, and also shall be reduced and increased in
accordance with Section 17.1(e).   (c) The indemnity provided in Sections
16.2 and 16.6 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and the
Purchaser Designees after the Closing Date with respect to any and all
claims, including any claims arising under Environmental Laws, relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement other than for fraud, willful
misrepresentation or willful deceit and claims relating to Taxes (which shall
be governed solely by the provisions of Article XVII). Under no circumstances
will Seller be responsible for any consequential, incidental, special, or
punitive damages or damages resulting from lost profits or
business opportunities arising out of or resulting from any such claim,
except to the extent Purchaser or Purchaser Designee (or any other
indemnified party described in Sections 16.2 or 16.6) incurs such damages in
a Third Party Claim. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser and the
Purchaser Designees hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, remedies, claims
and causes of action it may have against Seller relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement arising under or based upon any United States
federal, state or local or any foreign statute, law, Environmental Laws
(including, without limitation, any claims for contribution under CERCLA (the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Contamination and Liability Act, as
amended, 42 U.S.C. ss. 9601 et seq.)), ordinance, rule or regulation or
otherwise except (i) as otherwise provided with respect to claims relating to
Taxes (which shall be governed solely by the provisions of Article XVII) and
(ii) for fraud, willful misrepresentation or willful deceit.   
-73-      (d) Notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 16.5
below must be given within the applicable survival period set forth in
Section 16.1 with respect to matters set forth in Section
16.2(a)(i).  16.3. INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER:   (a) Purchaser hereby
agrees to assume liability for, and defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller Group (including successors, assigns and transferees of Seller Group,
if any) and its directors, shareholders, officers, employees, agents,
consultants, representatives, Affiliates, successors and assigns from and
against any and all Losses (except those relating to Taxes, which
are governed solely by Article XVII) which any of them incurs as a result of
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this
Agreement; (ii) Purchaser\'s failure to pay or satisfy or cause to be paid or
satisfied any of the Assumed Liabilities when due and payable; (iii) any
breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained
herein or in any other document executed and delivered at the Closing; or
(iv) except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the
ownership, operations or control of the Business after the Closing Date.  
(b) Notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 16.5 below must be
given within the applicable survival period set forth in Section 16.1
with respect to matters set forth in Section 16.3(a)(i).   (c) The amount
of any Losses incurred by Seller Group shall be reduced and increased in
accordance with Section 17.1(e).   (d) The indemnity provided in this
Section 16.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller Group after the
Closing Date with respect to any and all claims, including any claims arising
under Environmental Laws relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
other than for fraud, willful misrepresentation or willful deceit and claims
relating to Taxes (which shall be governed solely by the provisions of
Article XVII). Under no circumstances will Purchaser be responsible for any
consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages or damages resulting
from lost profits or business opportunities arising out of or resulting from
any such claim, except to the extent Seller Group (or any other indemnified
party described in Section 16.2) incurs such damages in a Third Party Claim.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller Group hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and
all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against Seller relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement arising under or based upon
any United States federal, state or local or any foreign statute, law,
Environmental Laws (including, without limitation, any claims for
contribution under ERCLA, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise except
(i) as otherwise provided with respect to claims relating to Taxes (which
shall be governed solely by the provisions of Article XVII) and (ii) for
fraud, willful misrepresentation or willful deceit.  16.4. INDEMNIFICATION
THRESHOLD AND DEDUCTIBLE:   (a) Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, neither party shall be entitled to any recovery from the
other party with respect to any breach of warranties or representations
unless and until the amount of such Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by
the    -74-     asserting party, or to which such party becomes
subject, by reason of such breach, shall exceed $2,000,000 calculated on a
cumulative basis (the "Basket Amount"), and then only with respect to the
excess over the Basket Amount; provided that (i) neither party shall be
entitled to indemnification for, and the Basket Amount shall not take into
account, any individual claim for less than $250,000; and (ii) the aggregate
amount payable by either party shall not exceed $184 million (the "Cap").  
(b) The Basket Amount and Cap shall not be applicable to (i) Losses based on
fraud, willful misrepresentation or willful deceit by Seller, (ii)
claims arising under Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.5(a), or the first sentence of
Section 8.6, (iii) claims for indemnification under Sections 16.3(a)(ii),
16.3(a)(iii) or 16.3(a)(iv) or under Sections 16.2(a)(iii) (other than claims
arising from the breach of a representation or warranty made by Seller in
this Agreement, which are Retained Liabilities , with respect to which both
the Basket Amount and the Cap shall be applicable (except as otherwise
provided in clause (ii) above)) or 16.2(a)(iv), (iv) claims relating to Taxes
(which shall be governed solely by the provisions of Article XVII), (v)
Environmental Claims (which shall be governed by Section 16.6), or (vi)
claims arising out of the Retained Liabilities in Section 2.2(f) (for which
no cap or basket under Sections 16.4 or 16.6 shall apply).  16.5.
INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES:   (a) Any party seeking indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnitee") shall notify the parties liable for such
indemnification (each an "Indemnitor") in writing of any event, omission or
occurrence which the Indemnitee has determined has given or could give rise
to Losses which are indemnifiable hereunder. Such written notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature and any particulars of the event,
omission or occurrence giving rise to a right of indemnification and the
amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim or demand,
such written notice being hereinafter referred to as a "Notice of Claim"). In
all cases, the Notice of Claim shall be given promptly, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Agreement regarding notice; provided, that the
failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided in this Section 16.5
shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Article XVI
except to the extent that the Indemnitor has suffered actual prejudice
thereby. The Indemnitor must satisfy its obligations hereunder, as the case
may be, within 30 days of its receipt of a Notice of Claim;
provided, however, that so long as the Indemnitor is in good faith defending
a claim pursuant to Section 16.5(b) below, its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnitee with respect thereto shall be suspended. To the extent the parties
disagree as to whether any Losses are indemnifiable hereunder, such matters
shall be resolved pursuant to Section 18.11 hereunder; provided, that during
the pendency of any such dispute, the party seeking indemnification may
defend the Loss for which indemnification is sought, and if it is determined
that the Loss is one that is subject to indemnification, the Indemnitor shall
be bound by all actions taken by the party seeking indemnification during the
pendency of such dispute.   (b) With respect to any third party claim,
demand, suit, action, proceeding or Loss ("Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing of the Third Party
Claim and such written notice shall specify the identity of the third party
making the claim and shall further specify in reasonable detail the nature
and any particulars of the event, omission or occurrence giving rise to a
right of indemnification and the amount or the estimated   
-750     amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall
not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim or demand). With respect
to any Third Party Claim, demand, suit, action, proceeding or Loss which is
the subject of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnitor shall at its own expense,
defend, contest or otherwise protect against any such claim, demand, suit,
actions, proceeding or Loss with legal counsel of its own choice and the
Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in
the defense thereof through legal counsel of its own choice and to assert any
and all cross claims or counterclaims it may have; provided, that the fees
and expenses of counsel to Indemnitee shall be at the Indemnitee\'s own
expense unless (a) the employment of such counsel and the payment of such
fees and expenses both shall have been specifically authorized by the
Indemnitor in connection with the defense of such Claim, demand, suit, action
or proceeding, or (b) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded and
specifically notified the Indemnitor that there may be specific defenses
available to it which are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnitor, or that such action, suit or proceeding involves or could
have an effect upon matters beyond the scope of the indemnity agreements
contained herein (in which case the Indemnitor, to the extent made necessary
by such different or additional defense or other effects, shall not have the
right to direct the defense of such claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding
on behalf of the Indemnitee). So long as the Indemnitor is defending in good
faith any such third party claim, demand, suit, action, proceeding or Loss,
the Indemnitee shall at all times cooperate, in all reasonable ways
with, make its relevant files and records available for inspection and
copying by, and make its employees available or otherwise render reasonable
assistance to, the Indemnitor. In the event that the Indemnitor elects not to
or fails to timely defend, contest or otherwise protect against any such
Third Party Claim, demand, suit, action, proceeding or Loss, the Indemnitee
shall, for the account of the Indemnitor, defend, contest, assert cross
claims or counterclaims, or otherwise protect against, the same and may make
any compromise or settlement thereof, provided the Indemnitee obtains the
prior written consent of the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor shall make no
settlement without Indemnitee\'s consent of any claims which Indemnitor has
undertaken to defend, unless (i) the Indemnitor fully indemnifies the
Indemnitee for all Losses; (ii) the Indemnitee receives an unconditional
release with respect to the facts underlying the claim; (iii) there is no
finding or admission of violation of law by, or effect on any other claims
that may be made against, the Indemnitee; and (iv) the relief granted
in connection therewith requires no action or inaction on the part of and has
no other material effect on the Indemnitee.   (c) All indemnification
payments required to be made under Section 16.2 shall be made directly by the
relevant member of the Seller Group to the Purchaser or the relevant
Purchaser Designee (as applicable), and all indemnification payments required
to be made under Section 16.3 shall be made directly by the Purchaser or the
relevant Purchaser Designee (as applicable) to the relevant member of the
Seller Group and such payments shall be treated for Tax purposes as provided
in the second sentence of Section 17.1(d).   (d) All procedures relating to
Tax indemnification payments shall be governed solely by Article
XVII.  16.6. ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNIFICATION:   (a) Indemnification by
Seller    -76-      (i) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall
indemnify, hold  harmless and defend Purchaser and Purchaser Designees, and
their respective  directors, shareholders, officers, employees, agents,
consultants,  representatives and Affiliates, from and against any Losses
arising out of  or relating to (A) the presence or release of Hazardous
Substances in, on  or beneath any real property formerly owned, leased,
operated, or managed  by any member of the Seller Group (in connection with
the Business or the  Target Assets) or the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of
their respective  predecessors, in each case, to the extent existing on or
prior to the  Closing Date, and (B) except as specifically provided in
Section  16.2(a)(iii)(A) (with respect to the Retained Liabilities set forth
in  Section 2.2(f)), the exposure of any person, prior to the Closing Date,
to  any Hazardous Substances that were generated from, or located on, in or 
about any property formerly owned, leased, operated or managed by any  member
of the Seller Group (in connection with the Business or the Target  Assets)
or the Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their respective  predecessors
(collectively, "Indemnified Off-Site Environmental Costs").   (ii) From and
after the Closing Date, other than with respect to  Indemnified Off-Site
Environmental Costs indemnified pursuant to Section  16.6(a)(i), Seller shall
indemnify, hold harmless and defend Purchaser and  Purchaser Designees, and
their respective directors, shareholders,  officers, employees, agents,
consultants, representatives and Affiliates,  from and against any Losses
arising out of or relating to (A) the disposal  of, or arranging for the
disposal of, any Hazardous Substances to, from or  at any off-site location,
that were used, generated or stored by the  Business, the Target Assets, any
member of the Seller Group (in connection  with the Business or the Target
Assets) or the Purchased Subsidiaries or  any of their respective
predecessors, in each case, to the extent disposed,  arranged for the
disposal of, used, generated or stored on or prior to the  Closing Date, (B)
the violation of any Environmental Laws in connection  with the operation of
the Business, the Target Assets or Purchased  Subsidiaries as conducted at
any time prior to Closing; (C) except as  specifically provided in Section
16.2(a)(iii)(A) (with respect to the  Retained Liabilities set forth in
Section 2.2(f)), the presence or release  of, or exposure to, Hazardous
Substances in, on or beneath any Real  Property, in the case of each of (B)
and (C), to the extent existing or  occurring, or arising out of
circumstances or conditions existing or  occurring, on or prior to the
Closing Date; and (D) any breach of any  representation or warranty made by
Seller in Section 8.13 of this Agreement  (collectively, "Indemnified
Environmental Costs").   (b) Certain Financial Limitations   (i) Purchaser
shall be solely responsible for the first $3.25 million  of Indemnified
Environmental Costs actually paid.   (ii) Seller shall be responsible for
eighty percent (80%) (and  Purchaser or the Purchaser Designees shall be
responsible for twenty  percent (20%)) of any Indemnified Environmental Costs
actually paid in  excess of $3.25 million.   (iii) Seller shall not be
responsible (and Purchaser or the Purchaser  Designees shall be responsible)
for any Indemnified Off-Site Environmental  Costs or Indemnified   
-77-      Environmental Costs under Section 16.6(a) in excess of $65.75
million. For  the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller\'s total
responsibility for  Indemnified Off-Site Environmental Costs or Indemnified
Environmental Costs  exceed $50 million.   (iv) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement,  Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify
Purchaser or the Purchaser  Designees with respect to any Environmental Claim
(as defined below) for  Indemnified Environmental Costs unless the
Indemnified Environmental Costs  resulting from such Environmental Claim
exceed $10,000 (the "Threshold").   (v) Any and all payments by Seller
pursuant to Section 16.6(a) shall  not count towards the Basket Amount or Cap
set forth in Section 16.4.   (c) Additional Terms and Limitations   In
addition to any other terms and limitations on Seller\'s
indemnification obligations under this Section 16.6:   (i) In connection
with any Environmental Claim, Purchaser and Seller,  as the case may be,
shall act only in a "Commercially Reasonable Manner,"  which shall mean the
most reasonable cost methods for investigation,  remediation, removal,
corrective action, containment, monitoring and/or  other response action
permitted by applicable Environmental Laws determined  from the perspective
of a reasonable business person acting (without regard  to the availability
of indemnification hereunder) to achieve compliance  with Environmental Laws
(it being understood that such Commercially  Reasonable Manner shall include,
where appropriate, the use of risk-based  remedies, institutional or
engineering controls, or deed restrictions,  provided such controls do not
unreasonably interfere with Purchaser\'s use  of the Real Property for
industrial purposes or Purchaser\'s ability to  conduct the Business in the
manner conducted as of the Closing Date).   (ii) Seller shall have no
indemnification obligations under this  Section 16.6 to the extent
Indemnified Environmental Costs result from or  are the consequence of any
action (including any disclosure, report or  other communication from the
Purchaser (or its agents) to any governmental  entity or other third party or
any Phase II environmental investigations or  sampling, testing or monitoring
of the soil, surface water or groundwater  voluntarily performed after the
Closing by Purchaser or its agents at the  Real Property) that is not (A) in
response to a Third Party Claim, (B)  required by any Environmental Laws, (C)
necessary in connection with a  condition first discovered as a result of
construction activities at, on or  beneath the Real Property or (D) necessary
to respond to a condition at, on  or beneath the Real Property which, if
unaddressed, would reasonably be  expected to become the subject of a Third
Party Claim (it being understood  in the case of each of (C) and (D) that all
Indemnified Environmental Costs  shall be required by applicable
Environmental Laws).   (iii) Seller\'s indemnification obligations under
this Section 16.6  shall be reduced to the extent that as a result of any
act, omission or  negligence of Purchaser (or    -78-      its
agents) after the Closing Date, the amount of Indemnified Off-Site 
Environmental Costs or Indemnified Environmental Costs are exacerbated.  
(iv) Seller shall have no indemnification obligations under this  Section
16.6 to the extent Indemnified Environmental Costs result, in whole  or in
part, from any Change after the Closing Date caused by Purchaser (or  its
agents) or any subsequent owner, operator or tenant of the Real  Property.
"Change" means (i) sale or closure of all or a portion of the  Real Property
or the Business, or (ii) any change in use of the Real  Property from its
current use to any nonindustrial or noncommercial use.   (v) Any
Environmental Claim subject to indemnification by Seller under  both Section
16.6(a)(ii)(D) and any of the other environmental indemnities  set forth in
Section 16.6(a)(i), 16.6(a)(ii)(A), 16.6(a)(ii)(B) or  16.6(a)(ii)(C), shall
be indemnified solely in accordance with Section  16.6(a)(i), 16.6(a)(ii)(A),
16.6(a)(ii)(B) or 16.6(a)(ii)(C), as the case  may be.   (d) Environmental
Procedures   (i) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 16.6(d)(ii)-(iv),
the  indemnification procedures of Sections 16.5(a) and 16.5(b) shall apply
to  any party seeking indemnification for Indemnified Off-Site
Environmental  Costs or Indemnified Environmental Costs (collectively, an
"Environmental  Claim").   (ii) Except as otherwise provided in Section
16.6(d)(iii), Purchaser  shall have the right to control the defense or
negotiation (including any  investigatory, response or remedial actions) of
any Environmental Claim for  which Purchaser or the Purchaser Designees are
entitled to indemnification  pursuant to Section 16.6(a)(ii)(B), (C) or (D),
including its resolution,  compromise or settlement, with counsel and
environmental consultant  selected, if any, by Purchaser reasonably
acceptable to Seller. No  resolution, compromise or settlement in respect of
such Environmental Claim  may be reached by Purchaser without Seller\'s prior
written consent (which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the  event Purchaser has the right, but elects
not to, control the defense of  any such Environmental Claim, Seller shall
control the defense of any such  Environmental Claim, including its
resolution, compromise or settlement,  with counsel and consultant selected
by Purchaser reasonably acceptable to  Purchaser, and no resolution,
compromise or settlement in respect of such  Environmental Claim may be
reached by Seller without Purchaser\'s prior  written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed).   (iii)
Seller shall control the defense or negotiation (including any 
investigatory, response or remedial actions) of any Environmental Claim for 
which Purchaser or the Purchaser Designees are entitled to indemnification 
pursuant to Section 16.6(a)(i), 16.6(a)(ii)(A) or 16.6(a)(ii)(D) (to the 
extent related to Section 16.6(a)(i) or Section 16.6(a)(ii)(A)) and any 
other Environmental Claim under Section 16.6(a) that is a Third-Party Claim 
by a non-governmental party, including its final resolution, with counsel 
and environmental consultant, if any, selected by Seller reasonably 
acceptable to Purchaser. No resolution, compromise or settlement in respect 
of such Environmental Claim may be    -79-      reached by Seller
without Purchaser\'s prior written consent (which consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).   (iv) Purchaser or Seller,
at their sole cost, as the case may be, with  respect to any matter managed
and controlled by the other, shall have the  right to (i) participate in any
meetings or material negotiations with any  third party (excluding counsel,
consultants or other experts retained by  the controlling party) with respect
to any Environmental Claim and shall be  provided with reasonable advance
notice of the same; and (ii) review in  advance and provide comments on any
documents proposed to be submitted to  governmental authorities or other
third parties.   ARTICLE XVII.  Tax Matters  17.1. TAX INDEMNITIES:

Purchased Subsidiaries or relating to the Business or the Target Assets with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) imposed on any Purchased Subsidiary
(x) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period by reason of such Purchased

Taxes of any Tax Affiliate that is included in a Consolidated Group that
includes Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, or (z) as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise, as a result of any acquisition,

prior to the Closing, (iii) imposed upon or payable by Purchaser, any of
Purchaser\'s Affiliates or any Purchased Subsidiary by reason of or

payable by Purchaser, any of Purchaser\'s Affiliates or any Purchased
Subsidiary resulting from or arising out of the Restructuring Transactions,

Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 17.7, (vii) imposed on a U.K.
Purchased    -80-     Subsidiary with respect to a Post-Closing Tax
Period as a result of the requirement under applicable Tax Law that such U.K.
Purchased Subsidiary include an item of income, profits or gains in taxable
income for such Post-Closing Tax Period if under applicable Tax Law such item
of income, profits or gain is treated as earned, accrued or received or is
deemed to have been earned, accrued or received, in each case by such U.K.
Purchased Subsidiary during any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (viii) imposed on a
U.K. Purchased Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period as a
result of such U.K. Purchased Subsidiary having secondary liability for a Tax
liability of Seller or any present or former Affiliate of Seller, other than
any U.K. Purchased Subsidiary (including, without limitation, any Tax imposed
on a U.K. Purchased Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period by
reason of the failure of Seller or any such Affiliate of Seller to pay such
Tax at any time) if such secondary liability arises by operation of
applicable Tax Law, regardless of whether such secondary liability arises as
a result of such U.K. Subsidiary being included in a Tax Return filed by a
Consolidated Group with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that includes
Seller or any such Affiliate of Seller or a contractual arrangement with
Seller or any such Affiliate of Seller, or (ix) any Deemed Taxation Liability
of a U.K. Purchased Subsidiary, except, in each case, to the extent Purchaser
is otherwise liable for such Taxes under this Article XVII (the Taxes
described in this Section 17.1(a), collectively, "Seller Indemnified Taxes");
provided, however, that Seller shall not have any indemnification obligations
with respect to, and shall not otherwise be responsible for, any Taxes with
respect to Post-Closing Tax Periods (including any Taxes allocated to Post-
Closing Tax Periods pursuant to Section 17.6) arising out of or
resulting from any reduction in any losses, credits, Reliefs, allowances or
other similar Tax attributes of, or allocated under applicable Tax Law to,
the Purchased Subsidiaries arising in or attributable to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (including such losses, credits, Reliefs, allowances or other similar
Tax attributes which are allocated to Pre-Closing Tax Periods pursuant to
Section 17.6).   (b) Tax Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Seller
Group and their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,
consultants, representatives and successors, from and against any and all
Taxes (including, for avoidance of doubt, such Taxes arising out of or
resulting from any reduction in any Seller\'s Attributes by reason of or
attributable to the breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement relating
to Taxes under this Agreement) (i) imposed on the Purchased Subsidiaries or
relating to the Business or the Target Assets with respect to Post-Closing
Tax Periods, (ii) arising out of or payable by reason of any election under
Code Section 338 (or by reason of any actual or deemed election under
applicable U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law that is analogous or
comparable to Code Section 338) made by or at the direction of Purchaser or
any Affiliate of Purchaser (including any Purchased Subsidiary after the
Closing) with respect to any Purchased Subsidiary that is not made
in connection with an election under Section 338(h)(10) (or any actual or
deemed election under applicable U.S. state or local Tax Law that is
analogous or comparable to Code Section 338(h)(10)) with respect to such
Purchased Subsidiary, (iii) arising out of or payable by reason of any
election under Section 301.7701-3 of the U.S. Treasury Regulations (or by
reason of any actual or deemed election under applicable U.S. state or local

the U.S. Treasury Regulations) with respect to any Purchased Subsidiary made
after the Closing by or at the direction of Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser (including any Purchased Subsidiary after the Closing), (iv)
imposed on or payable by Seller or any of its Affiliates by reason of or
attributable to the breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement relating
to Taxes under this Agreement, (v) arising out of or resulting from any
transaction, omission or action carried out or effected by or at the
direction of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser involving any of the
Purchased Subsidiaries or the Target Assets or the Business that occurs (or
is deemed to occur) on the Closing Date and that is not in the ordinary
course of business, (vi) imposed on or with respect to Seller, any Affiliate
of Seller, any Purchased Subsidiary, the Business or the Target Assets with
respect to Pre-Closing    -81-     Tax Periods by reason of or
attributable to (x) any failure or omission on the part of Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser (including any Purchased Subsidiary) after the Closing
to make any election or claim or take any other action in accordance with
Section 17.5(c) or (y) the making, amending or revoking of any Tax elections
or claims by Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser, or any Purchased
Subsidiary after the Closing other than in accordance with Section 17.5(d),
(vii) payable by Seller, any Affiliate of Seller or any Purchased Subsidiary
arising out of or resulting from the Multi-Stage Closing, or (viii) Transfer
Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section 17.7 (the Taxes
described in this Section 17.1(b), collectively, "Purchaser Indemnified
Taxes").   (c) The indemnification obligations provided pursuant to this
Section 17.1 and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 8.15
of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) calendar days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect
to any waiver, mitigation or extension of such statute of limitations).  
(d) All payments required to be made under Section 17.1(a) and the
other provisions of this Article XVII shall be made directly by the relevant
member of the Seller Group to the Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser
Designee (as applicable), and all payments required to be made under Section
17.1(b) and the other provisions of this Article XVII shall be made directly
by the Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser Designee (as applicable) to the
relevant member of the Seller Group, in each case as soon as practicable.
Purchaser and Seller shall treat, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
(including the Purchased Subsidiaries) to treat, all payments made under this
Section 17.1 or under any other indemnity or payment provisions contained in
this Agreement as adjustments to the purchase price for all Tax purposes, and
Purchaser and Seller agree that such adjustments shall be allocated to the
relevant Purchased Assets in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions
of Section 3.3 and 17.2. The provisions set forth in Schedule 17.1(d) shall
apply if Seller is required to make a payment under Section 17.1(a) with
respect to any U.K. Purchased Subsidiary.   (e) Without in any way limiting
Seller\'s or Purchaser\'s obligation to make indemnification payments under
this Agreement, if any Loss or Tax with respect to which any claim for
indemnification is made under this Agreement, including for this purpose a
request for payment of a Tax by Seller under Section 17.4(a)(ii) or Section
17.4(b) (an "Indemnity Claim") gives rise to a Tax Benefit or Tax Cost to the
person making the Indemnity Claim or any Affiliate of such person (such
person or Affiliate, the "Claimant"), then the amount of the related
indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of such Tax Benefit or shall
be increased by the amount of such Tax Cost; provided, however, that if the
party obligated to make such indemnity payment under this Agreement
(Seller or Purchaser as such, the "Indemnifying Party") receives evidence
reasonably demonstrating that such Claimant has not actually previously used,
and will not be able to actually use in the taxable period in which such
indemnity payment is to be made, all or a portion of such Tax Benefit, then
(i) the amount of the such indemnity payment shall be reduced only by the
portion of such Tax Benefit (if any) that such Claimant has previously
actually used or will be able to actually use in such taxable period and (ii)
the party entitled to receive such indemnity payment under this Agreement
(Purchaser or Seller as such, the "Indemnified Party") will be obligated to
pay to such Indemnifying Party the amount of any unused portion of such Tax
Benefit at such times or times as and to the extent that such Claimant
actually uses such portion. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Tax
Benefit"    -82-   means the amount (determined under this Section
17.1(e)) by which the Tax liability or Tax sharing liability of a Claimant
for a taxable period is reduced (including, without limitation, by deduction,
reduction of income upon a sale, disposition or other similar transaction as
a result of increased Tax basis, receipt of a refund of Taxes, use of a
credit of Taxes or increase in the amount of its losses, Reliefs, allowances
or other similar Tax attributes) plus any related interest received from the
relevant Tax authority, as a result of incurring or suffering any such Loss
or Tax, or for purposes of Section 17.4(a)(ii) or Section 17.4(b), arising
from payment or accrual of any Taxes owed by Seller that are referred to
therein. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Tax Cost" means the amount
(determined under this Section 17.1(e)) by which the Tax liability of a
Claimant for any taxable period is increased as a result of the Claimant\'s
receipt or accrual of an indemnity payment being treated as an item of income
for applicable Tax purposes, reduced by any Tax Benefit arising as a result
of a related deduction or credit of Tax; provided, however, that any Tax that
is withheld or deducted from an indemnity payment will not be treated as a
Tax Cost to the extent that such Tax would not have been required to be
so withheld or deducted but for the Claimant\'s failure to comply with
any certification, identification, information, documentation or other
reporting requirement or to make and deliver any declaration or other similar
claim which the Claimant is legally able to make and deliver, if (A) such
compliance or the making and delivering of such declaration or similar claim,
as the case may be, is required or imposed by applicable Tax Law in order to
make any claim for exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, the
withholding or deduction of such Tax, and (B) the Indemnifying Party has
given at least 30 calendar days prior written notice to the Claimant that
such compliance or the making and delivering of such declaration or similar
claim, as the case may be, is so required or imposed. The amount of any Tax
Benefit or Tax Cost for a Claimant for a taxable period shall be calculated
by comparing (x) the Tax liability or Tax sharing liability of such Claimant
computed without regard to any losses, deductions, credits, refunds or other
Tax items attributable to such Loss or Tax and the Claimant\'s receipt or
accrual of the related indemnity payment, to (y) the Tax liability or Tax
sharing liability of such Claimant computed taking into account any losses,
deductions, credits, refunds or other Tax items attributable to such Loss or
Tax and the Claimant\'s receipt or accrual of the related indemnity payment.
In the event that there shall be a Determination or settlement disallowing
all or a portion of any losses, credits, deductions, refunds or other Tax
items attributable to such Loss or Tax or requiring that the receipt or
accrual of an indemnity payment be treated as income recognized by the
Claimant, the amount of the related Tax Benefit or Tax Cost shall
be recalculated in accordance with the terms of this Section 17.1(e) and
payments shall be made between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party reflecting such Determination within 10 calendar days of such
Determination. The provisions of Schedule 17.1(e) shall apply with respect to
a U.K. Purchased Subsidiary.   (f) The provisions contained in this Article
XVII shall be the exclusive provisions of this Agreement governing
indemnification for Taxes and the procedures relating thereto and any other
matters relating to Taxes covered in such provisions, and the indemnity
provided in Section 17.1 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser
and the Purchaser Designees, on the one hand, and the Seller Group on the
other hand, after the Closing Date with respect to all claims relating to
Taxes other than for fraud, willful misrepresentation or willful deceit.
Under no circumstances will Purchaser or Seller be responsible for any
consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages or damages resulting
from lost profits or business opportunities arising out of or resulting from
any such claim. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser, the Purchaser
Designees and the Seller Group hereby waive, from and after the   
-83-     Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
any and all rights, remedies, claims and causes of action it may have against
the other party relating to the subject matter of this Article XVII arising
under or based upon any United States federal, state or local or any foreign
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise except for fraud,
willful misrepresentation or willful deceit.   (g) For avoidance of doubt,
any Taxes (i) imposed on Worcestor Controls Licensco Inc. by reason of an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or any actual or deemed
election under applicable U.S. state or local Tax Law that is analogous or
comparable to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code) made jointly by Purchaser and
Seller with respect to Worcestor Controls Licensco Inc. or (ii) arising out
of the purchase and sale under this Agreement of the interest in each U.S.
LLC, shall be borne by Seller, shall be treated under this Agreement as
arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall constitute an obligation
of Seller under Section 17.1(a).  17.2. SECTION 338 ELECTIONS; ALLOCATIONS
OF PURCHASE PRICE:   (a) With respect to the purchase and sale of the shares
of capital stock of Worcestor Controls Licensco Inc. ("WCL") at the
Purchaser\'s request, Seller shall join with Purchaser in making a timely
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 and, at the Purchaser\'s request, any corresponding
elections with any U.S. state or local Tax jurisdiction in which WCL has
filed Income Tax Returns (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections").
As soon as practicable after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide to Seller
for Seller\'s review and approval, and execution upon such approval, the
Internal Revenue Service Forms 8023 with respect to such Section 338(h)(10)
Election, including all additional data and materials required to be attached
to such Form 8023 pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 (and, as applicable, analogous forms required pursuant to any
corresponding provisions of applicable U.S. state or local Tax Law).
Purchaser shall be responsible for filing all such Form 8023 (and any
such analogous U.S. state or local forms). In addition, Seller and Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate with each other to take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate (including timely preparation and filing of such
additional forms, Tax Returns, elections, schedules and other documents
separately or jointly) as may be required to effect and preserve timely and
effective Section 338(h)(10) Elections in accordance with Code Section
338(h)(10), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and any corresponding
provisions of applicable U.S. state or local Tax Law. If Section 338
Elections are made with respect to WCL, Seller and Purchaser shall report the
purchase and sale of the shares of capital stock of WCL in a manner
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and shall not take (or cause
or permit their respective Affiliates to take) any position inconsistent
therewith in any Tax Return or Tax Matter, except as required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Code Section 1313(a) (or a comparable
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law) (a "Determination"), without
the prior written consent of the other party. Without Seller\'s prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), Purchaser will not make, or cause or permit any of its
Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary) to make, any elections under
Code Section 338 (or any corresponding or analogous provision of U.S. state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law) with respect to Worcester Do Brazil
Ltda, Worcester Controls France SARL or Canada Worchestor Controls Ltd.   
-84-      (b) In the event that Section 338(h)(10) Elections are made
with respect to WCL, for purposes of making such Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, Seller and Purchaser shall together and in good faith agree within
30 calendar days after the final determination of the adjustments to the
Purchase Price under Article IV on the computation of the "aggregate deemed
sales price" (as such term is defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations section
1.338-4) ("ADSP") with respect to WCL ("ADSP Computation") and the allocation
of such ADSP among the assets of WCL (the "ADSP Allocation"), in each case,
in accordance with the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code
Section 338(h)(10) (and any comparable provisions of U.S. state or local Tax
Law, as applicable) and in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation.  
(c) Seller and Purchaser shall together and in good faith agree on
any adjustments to the ADSP Computation and the ADSP Allocation that are
required by reason of any indemnification payments or other payments made
pursuant to this Agreement that are attributable to WCL within 15 calendar
days of such adjustments being finally determined or such payments being made
pursuant to this Agreement.   (d) If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
agree with respect to the ADSP Computation or the ADSP Allocation or any
adjustments thereto within the relevant time period specified in this Section
17.2, the items in dispute shall be referred to a single Independent Firm,
mutually selected, and jointly engaged, by the parties, no later than ten
calendar days after the end of such relevant time period for resolution by
the Independent Firm. The Independent Firm shall be instructed to notify
Seller and Purchaser of its resolution of the disputed items within fifteen
Business Days of such referral and that its resolution of the disputed items
must be consistent with the Final Allocation and the portion of the ADSP
Computation or the ADSP Allocation, as the case may be, to which Seller and
Purchaser have agreed. The Independent Firm\'s resolution of the disputed
items shall be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates. Expenses and fees of the Independent Firm incurred in connection
with such dispute shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the disputed items resolved by
the Independent Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be
determined by the Independent Firm at the time the determination of the
Independent Firm is rendered on the disputed items.   (e) The ADSP
Computation and the ADSP Allocation and any adjustments to the ADSP
Computation or the ADSP Allocation as determined pursuant to this
Section 17.2 shall be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser (and their
respective Affiliates, including the Purchased Subsidiaries) for all Tax
purposes (including, without limitation, preparation and filing of Tax
Returns, subject to adjustment to reflect Seller\'s selling expenses as a
reduction of sales proceeds and Purchaser\'s acquisition expenses as an
adjustment to purchase price), and Seller and Purchaser shall not take (or
cause or permit any of their respective Affiliates, including the Purchased
Subsidiaries, to take) any position inconsistent with the ADSP Computation
and the ADSP Allocation and any adjustments to the ADSP Computation or the
ADSP Allocation in any Tax Return or Tax Matter, except to the extent
required pursuant to a Determination.  17.3. POST CLOSING ACTIONS WHICH
AFFECT SELLER\'S LIABILITY FOR TAXES: During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on March 31, 2003, Purchaser shall not cause or
permit any of Worcester Do Brazil Ltda, Worcester Controls France   
-85-     SARL or Canada Worcester Controls Limited to make any
distribution (including a deemed distribution) to shareholders in excess of
current earnings and profits (as computed for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) derived during the period beginning on the day following the
Closing Date and ending on March 31, 2003.  17.4. TAX RETURNS:   (a) Tax

Schedule 17.4(f) shall apply, at the request of Seller,  Purchaser shall
cause each Purchased Subsidiary to consent to join, and  join, for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods for which such Purchased Subsidiary  is required or
eligible to do so, in any consolidated, combined, unitary,  affiliated,
aggregate or similar U.S. or non-U.S. federal, provincial,  state or local or
other non-U.S. Income Tax Returns which include Seller or  any Affiliate of
Seller other than any of the Purchased Subsidiaries.  Seller shall cause to
be prepared and timely filed all such Income Tax  Returns. Purchaser will

accordance with past practice and custom relating to  such Purchased
Subsidiary. Purchaser shall not take (or cause or permit any  of its
Affiliates, including any Purchased Subsidiary, to take) any  position
inconsistent with such Purchased Subsidiary\'s being a member of  the
applicable consolidated, combined, unitary, affiliated or similar group  for
all such Pre-Closing Tax Periods unless otherwise required by a 
Determination. Seller shall cause to be timely paid and shall be  responsible
for all Income Taxes to which such Income Tax Returns relate  for all taxable
periods covered by such Income Tax Returns. Promptly after  the filing of
such Income Tax Returns, Seller shall provide to Purchaser  copies of the
portions of such Income Tax Returns that relate solely to the  Purchased
Subsidiaries.   (ii) Except with respect to U.K. Purchased Subsidiaries to
which the  provisions of Schedule 17.4(f) shall apply, Seller shall timely
prepare or  cause to be timely prepared, and Purchaser shall timely file or
cause to be  timely filed, all Tax Returns (other than those covered by
Section  17.4(a)(i)) relating to Purchased Subsidiaries or the Target Assets
for all  taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are
required to  be filed after the Closing Date, provided, however, that
Purchaser shall  timely prepare or cause to be timely prepared such Tax
Returns as agreed  upon by Seller and Purchaser prior to the Closing Date and
Seller shall  reimburse Purchaser for its reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in the  preparation of such Tax Returns. Purchaser will provide or
cause to be  provided to Seller, no later than 60 calendar days after receipt
of a  written request from Seller, Tax information pertaining to such
Purchased  Subsidiaries and the Target Assets for inclusion in such Tax
Returns in  accordance with past practice and custom relating to such
Purchased  Subsidiaries and the Target Assets. All Tax Returns described in
this  Section 17.4(a)(ii) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
prior  practice of the Purchased Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required
by  applicable Tax Law. Seller shall provide to Purchaser for Purchaser\'s 
comments each Tax Return described in this Section 17.4(a)(ii) at least
30    -86-      calendar days before the due date (including
extensions) for the filing of  such Tax Return and Purchaser shall provide
comments on such Tax Return no  later than 15 calendar days after its receipt
of such Tax Return. Seller  shall provide to Purchaser for Purchaser\'s
signature each Tax Return  described in this Section 17.4(a)(ii) at least
five (5) Business Days  before the due date (including extensions) for the
filing of such Tax  Return, and Purchaser shall execute and timely file each
such Tax Return as  prepared or approved by Seller, provided that there is a
reasonable basis  (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations section
1.6662-3(b)(3) or  analogous or comparable provisions of U.S. state or local
or non-U.S. Tax  Law) in applicable Tax Law for the positions that Seller
determines shall  be taken in such Tax Return. Purchaser shall timely pay or
cause to be  timely paid all Taxes of the Purchased Subsidiaries or relating
to the  Target Assets to which such Tax Returns relate, and Seller shall pay
to  Purchaser, at least two calendar days prior to the date such Taxes are
due  to the applicable Tax authority, the amount of such Taxes owed by
Seller  pursuant to Section 17.1(a) with respect to the taxable period
covered by  such Tax Returns (taking into account the amounts of any
estimated Taxes or  prepaid Taxes paid on or before the Closing Date and any
amount of such  Taxes owed by Purchaser pursuant to Section 17.1(b)).   (b)
Straddle Period Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Purchased
Subsidiaries for Straddle Periods. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Purchased Subsidiaries,
except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law and except that, to the
extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, Purchaser may cause the Purchased
Subsidiaries to change the date on which their taxable years end to a date
prior to March 31, 2003 (and, to the extent the taxable year of any
of Worcester Do Brazil Ltda, Worcester Controls France SARL or Canada
Worcester Controls Limited is so changed, Section 17.3 shall be applied by
substituting such earlier date for "March 31, 2003" in each place "March 31,
2003" appears in Section 17.3). Purchaser shall provide to Seller for
Seller\'s review and approval each such Tax Return described in the preceding
sentence at least 30 calendar days before the due date (including extensions)
for the filing of such Tax Return. Purchaser shall timely pay or cause to be
timely paid all Taxes of the Purchased Subsidiaries to which such Tax Returns
relate for all taxable periods covered by such Tax Returns. Seller shall pay
to Purchaser, at least two calendar days prior to the date such Taxes are due
to the applicable Tax authority, the amount of such Taxes owed by Seller
pursuant to Section 17.1(a) with respect to the taxable period covered by
such Tax Returns determined in accordance with Section 17.6 and taking into
account the amounts of any estimated Taxes or prepaid Taxes paid on or before
the Closing Date and the amount of such Taxes owed by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 17.1(b) with respect to the taxable period covered by such Tax
Returns. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser an amount equal to
the product of (i) the out-of-pocket professional fees that Purchaser or its
Affiliates reasonably and properly incur to prepare such Tax Returns and (ii)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is 365, no later than 10 Business Days after Seller\'s receipt of
invoices and other materials describing in reasonable detail the nature,
amount and calculation of such fees.   (c) Value Added Taxes.   
-87-      (i) Notwithstanding Section 17.4(b) or Section 17.7, value
added Taxes  imposed by the United Kingdom and South Africa and Tax Returns
of or  relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries and the Business with respect
to  such value added Taxes will be governed by the provisions set forth in
this  Section 17.4(c) and Schedule 17.4(c).   (ii) Purchaser and Seller
intend that the provisions of Section 49(1)  VATA and Article 5 of the Value
Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995  shall apply to the transfer of the
Business and Target Assets located in  the United Kingdom ("UK Business and
Assets") pursuant to this Agreement.  Seller and Purchaser will use their
best efforts (and will cause their  respective Affiliates to use their best
efforts) to secure that pursuant to  the said Section 49(1) VATA and Article
5, the sale of the U.K. Business  and Assets pursuant to this Agreement is
not treated as either a supply of  goods or a supply of services for the
purposes of value added tax imposed  by the United Kingdom ("U.K. VAT").
Purchaser warrants that either it or  its applicable Affiliate is, or will
immediately after the Closing become,  a taxable person registered for the
purposes of U.K. VAT and that it or its  applicable Affiliate is buying for
itself and as agent of the Purchaser the  Business and Target Assets located
in the United Kingdom ("UK Business and  Assets") with the intention of
carrying on the same kind of business as  that carried on by the Seller or
its applicable Affiliate in relation to  the UK Business and Assets. Seller
will procure that, as soon as possible  after the Closing, Seller or its
applicable Affiliates will deliver to  Purchaser (or, at the direction of
Purchaser, to Purchaser\'s applicable  Affiliates) all the U.K. VAT records
relating to the UK Business and Assets  that are required under section
49(1)(b) VATA to be preserved by Purchaser  or its applicable Affiliates in
place of Seller or its applicable  Affiliates, and that Seller will not make
any request to HM Customs and  Excise for those records to be retained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates.  Purchaser will preserve such U.K. VAT
records for a period of not less than  6 years from the Closing (or such
longer period as may be required by  applicable law). Upon being given
reasonable notice by Seller, Purchaser  will make (and will cause its
applicable Affiliates to make) such U.K. VAT  records available to the Seller
for inspection or photocopying. Prior to  the Closing, Seller shall provide
written notice to Purchaser in the event  that it or any relevant associate
of it (within the meaning of paragraph 3  schedule 10 VATA) has or will prior
to Closing make any election under  paragraph 2 of the said schedule in
respect of any of the Target Assets  located in the United Kingdom or in the
event that any of the Target Assets  located in the United Kingdom is a new
or incomplete building or civil  engineering work for the purpose of item
1(a) of group 1 schedule 9 VATA.   (iii) In respect of the treatment of
value added tax imposed by South  Africa ("SA VAT") as regards the transfer
of the Business and Target Assets  located in South Africa, Purchaser and
Seller agree that (1) the part of  the Business carried on by Seller using
the Target Assets located in South  Africa (the "enterprise") is an
enterprise capable of separate operation  and is being sold as a going
concern; (2) the aforesaid enterprise did  constitute an income earning
activity on the date hereof and will  constitute an income earning activity
on the Closing Date; (3) all of the  assets necessary to carry on the
enterprise are being disposed of by Seller  to Purchaser in terms of this
Agreement; (4) the sale of the enterprise  contained within this Agreement
falls within the ambit of section 11(l)(e)  of the Value Added Tax Act, No.
89 of 1991 ("VAT Act"), and therefore SA  VAT is payable thereon at the rate
of 0%; (5) Seller will provide Purchaser  with a tax    -88-    
invoice as contemplated by section 20(l) of the VAT Act and (6) each of 
Purchaser and Seller respectively warrant to the other that they or  their
relevant Affiliates (as applicable) are on the date hereof, and will  be on
the Closing Date, registered as vendors in terms of the Value Added  Tax Act,
No. 89 of 1991.   (iv) (1) Subject to Section 17.8(d), if, notwithstanding
the  provisions above, HM Customs and Excise determine that any U.K. VAT
shall  be payable on the sale of the UK Business and Assets hereunder (the
"VAT  Amount"), Purchaser or the relevant Business Purchaser, as the case may
be,  shall account and pay to Seller 50% of the VAT Amount on the date of
the  payment of such VAT Amount to HM Customs and Excise by Seller or, if
later,  within five Business Days after the date of delivery by Seller to
Purchaser  of a valid U.K. VAT invoice in an amount equal to the amount of
such VAT  Amount. Purchaser or the relevant Business Purchaser, as the case
may be,  shall account and pay to Seller for the balance of such VAT Amount
in  accordance with paragraph (2) below.   (2) Subject to Seller accounting
for the full amount of such VAT Amount  by the due date for payment,
Purchaser or the relevant Business  Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay
to Seller the balance of such  VAT Amount (or such part of it as is received
or set off), within five  Business Days of the Purchaser or the relevant
Business Purchaser, as  the case may be:   (a) actually receiving a VAT
repayment from HM Customs and Excise in respect of the balance of such VAT
Amount (or part of it); or   (b) actually receiving the benefit of setting
off the balance of such VAT Amount (or part of it) against its liability to
account to HM Customs and Excise for its output tax; provided always that any
portion of such VAT Amount that is not ultimately recoverable or creditable
by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall be borne 50% by Purchaser or
the relevant Business Purchaser, as the case may be, and 50% by Seller.  
(3) Any penalty, surcharge, fine or interest accrued by Seller for any late 
payment of such VAT Amount shall be borne by Seller if and to the extent 
such penalty, surcharge, fine or interest arises from any action taken or 
not taken by Seller, and shall be borne by Purchaser if and to the extent 
such penalty, surcharge, fine or interest arises from any action taken or 
not taken by Purchaser, as the case may be.   (4) Purchaser shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to use all reasonable  efforts to obtain a recovery or
credit of such VAT Amount and shall refrain  to the extent it is reasonably
practicable to do so, from any action that  would prejudice such recovery or
credit without the prior written consent  of Seller (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or  conditioned, as the case may be).  
(5) Purchaser shall promptly provide to Seller Tax Returns and other  records
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the timing and amount of  such
recoveries or credits and if, applicable, written evidence reasonably 
acceptable to Seller demonstrating    -89-      that all or any
portion of such VAT Amount is not recoverable or creditable  by Purchaser or
any Affiliate of Purchaser.   (6) If, following a payment by Purchaser to
Seller of an amount in respect  of such VAT Amount hereunder, HM Customs and
Excise or any tribunal or court  finally determine that U.K. VAT was not
properly chargeable on the sale of  the UK Business and Assets (or any of
them), Seller shall forthwith on such  determination issue to Purchaser an
appropriate VAT credit note and shall  repay to Purchaser an amount equal to
such amount or a credit against tax  due to HM Customs and Excise to the date
of the payment to Purchaser  hereunder.   (v) If and to the extent
applicable, the provisions of clause (iv) of this Section 17.4(c) shall apply
mutatis mutandis to any value added tax imposed by South Africa with respect
to the sale hereunder of the Target Assets and the Business located in South
Africa.   (d) Overpayments of Taxes by Seller. Seller and Purchaser agree
that if Seller and its Affiliates (including the Purchased Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing) pay (whether to a taxing authority or to Purchaser before or
after the Closing) an amount of Taxes of or relating to the Purchased
Subsidiaries, the Business or the Target Assets with respect to Straddle
Periods that exceeds the total amount of such Taxes owed by Seller pursuant
to Section 17.1(a) determined in accordance with Section 17.6 (for avoidance
of doubt, reduced by the amount of refunds or credits of such Taxes that are
paid by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 17.5(a)(ii)), then Purchaser
shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess no later than ten (10) Business
Days after Purchaser\'s receipt from Seller of a calculation of such excess,
along with Tax Returns, Tax receipts and other relevant materials that
support in reasonable detail such calculation.   (e) Restructuring Items.
Purchaser hereby agrees that Seller shall have the exclusive right to
determine the manner in which each Restructuring Item will be treated and
reported on any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period
or in any Tax Matter, provided that there is a reasonable basis (within the
meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.6662-3(b)(3) or analogous or
comparable provisions of U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law) in
applicable Tax Law for the manner in which Seller determines that
such Restructuring Item shall be treated or reported or for the positions
with respect to such Restructuring Item that Seller determines shall be taken
in any Tax Returns covering Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods or in
any Tax Matter. Purchaser shall not take, nor cause or permit any of its
Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary) to take, any position on any
Tax Return or in any Tax Matter that is inconsistent with the manner in which
Seller has determined a Restructuring Item shall be treated, other than
pursuant to a Determination. If Purchaser reasonably determines in good faith
that there is an issue concerning whether there is such a reasonable basis
for the manner in which Seller has determined that a Restructuring Item shall
be treated or reported or for the positions with respect to such
Restructuring Item that Seller has determined shall be taken in any Tax
Returns covering Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods or in any Tax
Matter, then (i) Purchaser shall promptly consult with Seller, and the
parties shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreement concerning whether there is such a reasonable basis therefore,
and (ii) upon Purchaser\'s reasonable request in writing made in connection
with such consultation, Seller shall provide (at Seller\'s cost and expense)
no later than 60 calendar days following Seller\'s receipt of such written
request, an    -90-     opinion or written advice of Tax counsel or
Tax accountants of recognized standing in the applicable taxing jurisdiction,
reasonably acceptable in form and substance to Purchaser, to the effect that
there is such a reasonable basis in applicable Tax Law for the manner in
which the Seller has determined such Restructuring Item will be treated or
reported or such positions with respect to such Restructuring Item.   (f)
Tax Returns of the U.K. Purchased Subsidiaries shall be governed by
the procedures set forth in Schedule 17.4(f).  17.5. REFUNDS AND TAX
BENEFITS:   (a) (i) All refunds or credits of Taxes (including interest
thereon) attributable to the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Business or the
Target Assets with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including, without
limitation, refunds or credits arising from amended Tax Returns filed after
the Closing Date in accordance with Section 17.8, refunds or credits
allocated to Seller under Section 17.6(b) and refunds of German Taxes
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods which certain Purchased Subsidiaries are
entitled to receive after the Closing Date) or attributable to any amount
paid by Seller pursuant to this Article XVII shall be for the account of
Seller Group (collectively, "Seller\'s Refunds").   (ii) If any Seller\'s
Refunds are received or used by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Purchased Subsidiaries), including any Seller\'s Refunds used by
Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (including the
Purchased Subsidiaries) as an offset against its Tax liability (other than a
liability of Seller under Section 17.1(a)), Purchaser shall pay (or cause to
be paid) to the relevant member of Seller Group within ten Business Days of
Purchaser\'s actual receipt or actual use of Seller\'s Refunds the amount of
such Seller\'s Refunds (reduced by any Tax required under applicable Tax Law
to be paid or withheld by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Purchased Subsidiaries) with respect thereto). Purchaser shall, at Seller\'s
request and at the sole expense of Seller, use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and expedite the receipt of any Seller\'s Refunds. Purchaser and
Seller shall treat, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to treat, all
Seller\'s Refunds as adjustments to purchase price for all U.S. and non-U.S.
Tax purposes, and Purchaser and Seller agree that for purposes of Sections
3.3 and 17.2 such adjustments shall be allocated to the relevant Purchased
Assets in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of Sections 3.3 and
17.2.   (b) For avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of computing the respective amounts of Seller
Indemnified Taxes and Purchaser Indemnified Taxes, Seller and Purchaser agree
that any and all losses, credits, Reliefs, allowances or other similar Tax
attributes of, or allocated under applicable Tax Law to, the Purchased
Subsidiaries arising in or attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(collectively, "Seller\'s Attributes") shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Tax Law, be used first to offset income, profits or gains of the
Purchased Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates arising in or
attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including such income, profits or
gains that are Restructuring Items or that arise in Pre-Closing Tax Periods
by reason of any settlements, resolutions or compromises of any Tax Matters.
Upon the earliest to occur of (a) the expiration of all applicable statutes
of limitations for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods with respect to a taxing
jurisdiction and a type of Tax (giving effect to any waivers, mitigations or
extensions of such statutes of limitations), (b) the final   
-91-     settlement, compromise or other resolution of all Tax Matters
(whether pursuant to Determinations, closing agreements or otherwise) with
respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods with respect to such taxing
jurisdiction and type of Tax, and (c) the complete closure to dispute by any
taxing authority of all Pre-Closing Tax Periods with respect to such taxing
jurisdiction and type of Tax, any unutilized portion of any Seller\'s
Attributes with respect to such taxing jurisdiction and type of Tax shall be
fully available for use by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Purchased Subsidiaries) in Post-Closing Tax Periods.   (c) Purchaser shall,
at the direction in writing of Seller, cause each Purchased Subsidiary
organized under the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction (each, a "non-U.S.
Purchased Subsidiary") to take all such steps as Seller may reasonably
require to:   (i) use and surrender in the manner hereinafter described all
Reliefs  arising as a consequence of or by reference to any transaction,
action or  omission occurring (or deemed to occur) on or before the Closing
or in  respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and not as a consequence of or
by  reference to any transaction, action or omission occurring (or deemed
to  occur) after the Closing or in respect of a Post-Closing Tax Period, as
are  available to such non-U.S. Purchased Subsidiary (such Reliefs
including,  without limitation, Reliefs made available to a company by means
of a  surrender from another company), the said use being to effect the
reduction  or elimination of any liability for Taxes to the extent specified
by Seller  in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of Section
17.4(b) and  to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, and to provide to
Seller, at  Seller\'s expense, a certificate from the auditors (for the time
being) of  such non-U.S. Purchased Subsidiary confirming that all such
Reliefs have  been so used;   (ii) make all such claims and elections
specified by Seller, and in  particular that Purchaser will cause any
Purchased Subsidiary organized  under the laws of the United Kingdom (a "U.K.
Purchased Subsidiary") to  make all such claims and elections, including,
without limitation,  surrenders of group relief as defined in Chapter IV of
Part X of the U.K.  Income and Corporation Tax Act, 1988, as Seller may
specify in a manner  that is consistent with the provisions of Section
17.4(b) in respect of any  accounting period of such U.K. Purchased
Subsidiary beginning before the  Closing Date as have the effect of reducing
or eliminating such liability  for Taxes as is mentioned in clause (i) of
this Section 17.5(c), provided  that no such claim or election shall require
such U.K. Purchased Subsidiary  to use or surrender any Relief which arises
solely as a consequence of or  by reference to a transaction, action or
omission occurring (or deemed to  occur) after the Closing or in respect of a
Post-Closing Tax Period, and  provided further that Purchaser shall not be
obliged to cause a U.K.  Purchased Subsidiary to use and/or surrender any
such Reliefs under this  Section 17.5(c)(ii) to the extent such use or
surrender would reasonably be  expected to, or would, increase such U.K.
Purchased Subsidiary\'s liability  for Taxes with respect to a Post-Closing
Period (except where such  increased liability for Taxes would arise solely
as a result of any  Seller\'s Attributes not being available, in whole or in
part, to be used or  surrendered in a Post-Closing Tax Period); and   (iii)
allow Seller to reduce or eliminate any such liability for Taxes  as is
mentioned in clause (i) of this Section 17.5(c) by surrendering, or  causing
any non-U.S.    -92-      Purchased Subsidiary or any Affiliate of
Seller to surrender, any loss,  allowance or other amount available for
surrender by or to such non-U.S.  Purchased Subsidiary or such Affiliate of
Seller to the extent permitted by  applicable Tax Law but without any payment
being made in consideration for  such surrender.   Seller shall reimburse
Purchaser for the out-of-pocket professional fees  that Purchaser or its
Affiliates may reasonably and properly incur to take  any action described in
this Section 17.5(c) no later than 10 Business Days  of Seller\'s receipt of
invoices and other materials describing in  reasonable detail the amount and
nature of such fees.   (d) Except to the extent otherwise provided in this
Article XVII and subject to Section 17.5(e), neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall, and neither shall cause or permit any of the Purchased Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates to, make, amend, or revoke any Tax
elections or claims with respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Target
Assets or the Business in a manner that would reasonably be expected to, or
would, (i) increase the amount of Taxes for which the other party is liable
under this Article XVII or otherwise result in adverse Tax consequences to
the other party or its Affiliates or (ii) reduce the amount of any Seller\'s
Attributes or Seller\'s Refunds, except pursuant to a Determination or except
with the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).   (e) Purchaser shall not,
and shall not cause or permit any of the Purchased Subsidiaries or any
Affiliate of Purchaser to, carryback any net operating loss, capital loss,
Tax credit or other Tax attribute attributable to Purchaser, any Affiliate of
Purchaser or any Purchased Subsidiary from a Post-Closing Tax Period into a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, including any
Purchased Subsidiary (a "Purchaser Carryback"), unless (i) Seller shall have
provided its prior written consent to such Purchaser Carryback or (ii) such
Purchaser Carryback is required (rather than being optional) under applicable
Tax Law and applicable Tax Law does not permit a waiver of such requirement
or a relinquishment of the carryback period as it relates to such Purchaser
Carryback (a "Mandatory Purchaser Carryback") (it being understood and agreed
by Purchaser that Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to Seller
written notice regarding such Mandatory Purchaser Carryback at least
30 calendar days prior to the filing of any Tax Return that reports or claims
such Mandatory Purchaser Carryback, which notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the nature and amount of such Mandatory Purchaser Carryback and such
applicable Tax Law). Seller\'s prior written consent to a Purchaser Carryback
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being understood and agreed
by Purchaser that Seller shall have the absolute right in its sole discretion
to withhold its consent to any Purchaser Carryback if such Purchaser
Carryback would reasonably be expected to, or would, (i) result in an
increase in the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable under Section
17.1(a), (ii) reduce the amount of any Seller\'s Refunds or Seller\'s
Attributes, or (iii) result in any adverse Tax consequences to Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller (including, with respect to any Pre-Closing Period, any
Purchased Subsidiary) (a "Seller Detriment"). In the absence of Seller\'s
prior written consent to any Purchaser Carryback, neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall be required to pay to Purchaser, any of the Purchased
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates any refund or credit of Taxes that
results from such Purchaser Carryback. In the event Seller provides its prior
written consent to any Purchaser Carryback, Seller shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser Designee    -93-     (as
applicable) within ten Business Days of the actual receipt or use of a refund
or credit of Taxes by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller that results
from such Purchaser Carryback the amount of such refund or credit (reduced by
any Tax required under applicable Tax Law to be paid or withheld by Seller or
any of its Affiliates with respect thereto). In the case of a Mandatory
Purchaser Carryback that actually gives rise to a Seller Detriment, Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller the amount of such Seller Detriment
that does not exceed the amount of the refund or credit of Taxes that
actually results from such Mandatory Purchaser Carryback (or if such refund
or credit of Taxes is actually received or used by Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, Seller or such Affiliate shall not be required to pay to Purchaser or
any Affiliate of Purchaser the amount of such refund or credit that does not
exceed the amount of such Seller Detriment).  17.6. ALLOCATION OF TAXES
ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRADDLE PERIODS:   (a) For purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of computing the respective amounts of Seller
Indemnified Taxes and Purchaser Indemnified Taxes, in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable with respect to a
Straddle Period, the amount of such Taxes and the amount of any losses,
credits, Reliefs, allowances or other similar Tax attributes of, or allocated
under applicable Tax Law to, a Purchased Subsidiary (as the case may be) that
are allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to such Straddle
Period shall (i) in the case of any Income Taxes and any sales,
use, transfer, transfer gains, employment, payroll and other similar Taxes
which are based on or related to sales, proceeds, receipts or disbursements,
be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable or the amount of such
losses, credits, Reliefs, allowances or other similar Tax attributes of, or
allocated under applicable Tax Law to, a Purchased Subsidiary (as the case
may be) if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date for
applicable Tax purposes (for avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise provided
in Section 17.7), and (ii) in the case of all other such Taxes (including
real and personal property Taxes and franchise Taxes that are not income
Taxes) be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes payable or the amount of any
losses, credits, Reliefs, allowances or other similar Tax attributes of, or
allocated under applicable Tax Law to, a Purchased Subsidiary (as the case
may be) for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in that portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, items of income, profit,
gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated to the day on which they arise or
are otherwise recognized for applicable Tax purposes.   (b) Subject to
Section 17.5(a)(i), any refunds of Taxes or credits of Taxes in lieu of
refunds of Taxes relating to a Straddle Period shall be allocated to Seller
in amount equal to the excess of (i) the sum of the amount of such Taxes paid
by Seller or the Purchased Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date
with respect to such Straddle Period and the amount of such Taxes paid by
Seller to Purchaser after the Closing Date under this Article XVII relating
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to such Straddle Period, over (ii)
the amount of such Taxes that are allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
with respect to such Straddle Period pursuant to subsection (a) of this
Section 17.6.   (c) Earnings and profits for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of this Section
17.6.    -94-      (d) All determinations necessary to give effect to
the allocations under this Section 17.6 shall be made in a manner consistent
with the prior practice of the Purchased Subsidiaries and shall be based on
the information used to determine the EBITDA Amount and Stated Net Book
Value.  17.7. TRANSFER TAXES: Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, (i) all transfer, transfer gains, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, conveyance and other similar Taxes and fees (including
penalties, interest and additions to tax attributable thereto and costs and
expenses relating to such Taxes), other than any such Taxes resulting from or
arising out of the Multi-stage Closing, (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller, and (ii)
Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all applicable Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes (including, for this
purpose, any such Taxes resulting from or arising out of the Multi-stage
Closing) in accordance with applicable Tax Laws, shall timely remit all
Transfer Taxes to the appropriate Tax authority and shall provide such Tax
Returns and other documentation to Seller no later than seven Business Days
prior to the due date (including extensions thereof) for such Tax Returns and
other documentation for Seller\'s review and approval (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).  17.8. TAX
CONTESTS:   (a) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall notify the other party in
writing within 15 Business Days of the receipt by Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be, or any of its Affiliates (including, with respect to Purchaser,
the Purchased Subsidiaries) of written notice of any pending or proposed Tax
Matter (as defined below) that may affect the Tax liabilities of the
Purchased Subsidiaries for which the other party would be liable in whole or
in part under Section 17.1 or any pending or proposed Tax Matter concerning
Transfer Taxes or value added Taxes with respect to the Target Assets. Such
notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing any
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by
copies of any notice and other documents received from any Tax authority in
respect of such Tax Matter. A party\'s failure to give such notice to the
other party as provided herein shall not affect the other party\'s
liabilities under Section 17.1 except to the extent that the other party is
materially prejudiced thereby.   (b) Except with respect to the U.K.
Purchased Subsidiaries to which the provisions of Section 17.8(e) shall
apply, Seller shall have the exclusive right to conduct and control any
matter, including any audit, review, claim, assessment, examination or
administrative or judicial proceeding or the filing of any amended Tax Return
or claim for Tax refund or Tax credit (a "Tax Matter") relating to any Tax
Return or Taxes of or with respect to the Business, the Purchased
Subsidiaries or the Target Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than
any Pre-Closing Tax Period of a Straddle Period), including
without limitation, the exclusive right to represent the Purchased
Subsidiaries\' interests in any such Tax Matter and to resolve, settle,
concede, compromise or contest any deficiency or adjustment proposed,
asserted or assessed in connection with or as a result of such Tax Matter;
provided, however, that (i) Seller shall not, and shall not cause or permit
any U.S. Purchased Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Seller to, settle, concede
or compromise any such Tax Matter relating to a U.S. Purchased Subsidiary or
file an    -95-     amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund or Tax
credit relating to a U.S. Purchased Subsidiary in a manner that either (x)
would reasonably be expected to increase, or would increase, the Taxes for
which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including a U.S. Purchased
Subsidiary) would be liable under Section 17.1(b) or (y) would have binding
effect on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including a U.S. Purchased
Subsidiary) in a Post-Closing Tax Period, in the case of clause (x) or clause
(y), without prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, (ii) Seller shall not, and
shall not cause or permit any non-U.S. Purchased Subsidiary or any Affiliate
of Seller to, settle, concede or compromise any such Tax Matter relating to a
non-U.S. Purchased Subsidiary or file an amended Tax Return or claim for Tax
refund or Tax credit relating to a non-U.S. Purchased Subsidiary without
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, and (iii) Purchaser shall be entitled to
participate in the conduct of any Tax Matter relating to a non-U.S. Purchased
Subsidiary or PMV Inc.; provided, however, that Purchaser\'s participation in
any aspect of any such Tax Matter shall not, under any circumstances, require
the disclosure of any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a
Consolidated Group which includes Seller or any Affiliate of Seller other
than the Purchased Subsidiaries, or any work papers or documents relating
thereto. Purchaser shall cooperate fully, and shall cause its Affiliates and
the Purchased Subsidiaries to cooperate fully, with Seller and its counsel in
the conduct, defense or settlement of any such Tax Matter, including by
executing and delivering (or causing to be executed and delivered) to Seller
or its designees all instruments (including, without limitation, powers of
attorney) reasonably requested by Seller in order to implement the provisions
of this Section 17.8(b). Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit
the Purchased Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of Purchaser to, settle, concede
or compromise any such Tax Matter without the prior written consent
of Seller. Except as provided in clause (c) below with respect to Straddle
Periods, Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to conduct and control any
Tax Matter relating to any Tax Return or Taxes of or with respect to the
Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries or the Target Assets for any Post-
Closing Period; provided, however, that if such Tax Matter would reasonably
be expected to increase, or would increase, the Taxes for which Seller would
be liable under Section 17.1(a), Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any Affiliate of Purchaser (including any Purchased Subsidiary) to,
settle, concede or compromise any such Tax Matter without prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.   (c) Subject to Section 17.4(e), in the case of a Tax
Matter involving a Tax liability or potential Tax liability relating to a
Straddle Period (a "Joint Tax"), if the amount of the Joint Tax relating to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period is equal to 50% or more of the total amount of the
Joint Tax, Seller shall elect either to conduct such Tax Matter or to tender
the conduct of such Tax Matter to Purchaser. If Seller tenders the conduct of
such Tax Matter to Purchaser and Purchaser declines to conduct such Tax
Matter, then Seller will conduct such Tax Matter. If the amount of the Joint
Tax relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period is less than 50% of the Joint Tax,
Purchaser shall elect either to conduct such Tax Matter or to tender the
conduct of such Tax Matter to Seller. If Purchaser tenders the conduct of
such Tax Matter to Seller and Seller declines to conduct such Tax Matter,
then Purchaser will conduct such Tax Matter. The party conducting a Tax
Matter relating to a Joint Tax shall control the conduct of such Tax Matter,
provided that the other party shall have the right to participate in such Tax
Matter at its own expense, and provided further that neither party shall, and
neither party shall cause or permit any    -96-     of its Affiliates
or a Purchased Subsidiary to, settle, concede or compromise a Joint Tax
without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, all of the costs of the conduct of a Tax Matter relating
to a Joint Tax shall be shared between Seller and Purchaser based on the
proportionate amount of such Joint Tax that is ultimately assessed (or,
if such Joint Tax is not ultimately assessed, the proportionate amount of
such Joint Tax that was contested in such Tax Matter) that relates to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
thereof beginning after the Closing Date.   (d) Any Tax Matter relating to
Transfer Taxes or value added Taxes with respect to the Target Assets shall
be jointly controlled and conducted by Seller and Purchaser, and neither
party shall, and neither party shall cause or permit any of its Affiliates or
any Purchased Subsidiary to, settle, concede or compromise any such Tax
Matter without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.   (e) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 17.8(d), Tax Matters with respect to the U.K.
Purchased Subsidiaries shall be governed by the provisions of Schedule
17.8(e).  17.9. OTHER TAX COVENANTS:   (a) Any and all Tax sharing
agreements, tax indemnity agreements and practices among or between the
Purchased Subsidiaries on the one hand and any members of the Seller Group or
any Affiliates of the Seller Group on the other hand shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date and no payments relating thereto shall be made subsequent
to the Closing Date and no rights or liabilities shall survive
thereunder.   (b) All powers of attorney authorizing any party to represent
any of the Purchased Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes shall be terminated
on or before the Closing Date.   (c) Each Purchased Subsidiary organized
under the laws of a state in the United States, other than Worcester Controls
Licensco Inc. and PMV Inc., shall immediately prior to the Closing be a U.S.
LLC that is classified as an entity disregarded as separate from its sole
owner under section 301.7701-3(b)(1) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations (and
any applicable analogous or comparable provisions of United States state or
local Tax Law).   (d) Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, including the Purchased Subsidiaries, to) treat the
purchase and sale of the interest in each U.S. LLC, as a purchase and sale of
all the assets of such U.S. LLC, subject to all of the Assumed Liabilities of
such U.S. LLC, for United States federal Tax purposes (and for applicable
United States state and local Tax purposes), and shall not take (or cause or
permit any of their respective Affiliates, including the Purchased
Subsidiaries, to take) any position inconsistent with such treatment in any
Tax Return or Tax Matter, except to the extent required pursuant to a
Determination.  17.10. COOPERATION:   (a) Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries, officers, employees and other
representatives to, afford to Purchaser and its representatives
reasonable    -97-     access, during normal business hours and in a
manner that is not unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the Business
or the business of Seller and its subsidiaries, to the Tax Returns (or
portions of Tax Returns of any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar group which includes Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than
any of the Purchased Subsidiaries)) together with accompanying schedules and
related workpapers, books, records, documents and other materials regarding
Taxes and Tax positions insofar as they relate solely to the Purchased
Subsidiaries or the Target Assets. During such period, (i) Seller shall
provide to Purchaser schedules setting forth the information described in
Schedule 17.10(a), such schedules to be provided no later than 10 calendar
days prior to the Closing (and, at Purchaser\'s written request, Seller shall
deliver or make available to Purchaser as promptly as practicable
any agreements or documents referred to in such schedules); (ii) Seller
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries, officers, employees and
representatives to, deliver or make available as promptly as practicable to
Purchaser all other information concerning Taxes or Tax positions insofar as
such information relates solely to the Purchased Subsidiaries or the Target
Assets as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request in writing; and
(iii) Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, make employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanations of any materials provided hereunder as Purchaser may from
time to time reasonably request in writing. Prior to the Closing Date, at
Purchaser\'s written request, Seller shall, and shall cause the relevant
Purchased Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to facilitate
the Tax planning objectives of Purchaser with respect to PMV, Inc. and any
additional costs reasonably and properly incurred by Seller, any Affiliate of
Seller or any Purchased Subsidiary and any additional Taxes payable by
Seller, any Affiliate of Seller or any Purchased Subsidiary (including,
without limitation, any such Taxes arising out of or resulting from any
reduction to Seller\'s Attributes, Seller\'s Refunds or any losses, credits,
Reliefs, allowances or other similar Tax attributes of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller) as a result of such cooperation or any actions
or transactions undertaken by Seller, any Affiliate of Seller or any
Purchased Subsidiary in connection with such cooperation, shall be for the
account of Purchaser and shall be treated as a Tax subject to indemnification
by Purchaser under Section 17.1(b). Purchaser will hold, and will cause its
directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and Affiliates, successors and assigns to hold, any
nonpublic information in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.   (b)
From and after the Closing Date, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, Seller Group and Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause
its Affiliates and the Purchased Subsidiaries to, assist and cooperate fully
with the other party and its Affiliates in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns pursuant to Section 17.4, any Tax Returns and
other documentation relating to Transfer Taxes, the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, the determination of Tax Benefits, the determination of
a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund or credit of Taxes or Reliefs
with respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries or the Target Assets relating to
Tax years or periods beginning before the Closing Date, and the preparation
and conduct of any Tax Matter relating to Tax years or periods beginning
before the Closing Date. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation,
the retention and, upon the other party\'s request, the provision of Tax
Returns, information, records and documents reasonably relevant to the
activities described in the preceding sentence and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to, (i) retain all    -98-     books
and records with respect to Taxes pertinent to the Purchased
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable year or period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (including
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable years or periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (ii) give Seller reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying, discarding any such books and records and, if
Seller requests, allow Seller to take possession of such books and
records.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller and its Affiliates shall not under any circumstances be required to
disclose to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (or any of their respective
representatives) any Tax Returns or portions of any Tax Returns (including
accompanying schedules and related workpapers), books, records, documents or
other materials or information regarding Taxes that do not relate solely to
the Purchased Subsidiaries or the Target Assets.   (d) Except as otherwise
provided in this Article XVII, each party shall reimburse the other party for
the out-of-pocket professional fees that the other party or any of the other
party\'s Affiliates may reasonably and properly incur from and after the
Closing Date to satisfy the other party\'s obligations under this Section
17.10 no later than 10 Business Days after the first party\'s receipt of
invoices and other materials describing in reasonable detail the amount and
nature of such fees.   (e) For purposes of this Agreement:   "Actual

XVIII.  Miscellaneous  18.1. BROKER COMPENSATION: Each of the parties
hereto agrees to indemnify the other against and hold the other harmless from
any and all liabilities (including, without limitation, cost of legal fees in
defending against such liabilities) for brokerage commissions or finder\'s
fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
insofar as such claims shall be based on arrangements or agreements made or
claimed to have been made by or on behalf of Seller and its Affiliates or
Purchaser and its Affiliates, respectively. Seller shall pay the fee of J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. for their services in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  18.2. BULK SALES ACT: Purchaser waives
compliance by the Seller Group with any bulk sales law which may be
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser and hold it harmless from
any loss, damage, liability, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees)
resulting from such noncompliance.  18.3. EXPENSES: Each of the parties
hereto shall pay its own expenses in connection with the negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and the Related Documents; provided that Seller
shall pay all expenses of the Business in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement.  18.4. BINDING AGREEMENT: This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided that neither
party shall assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other party hereto, except Purchaser may assign its rights under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, (i) to an Affiliate and (ii) as collateral
security for obligations of Purchaser and its Affiliates, each without
Seller\'s consent, provided that in no event will any assignment relieve the
assigning party of its obligations hereunder; and provided further,
that Seller shall have no greater liability under this Agreement following
any assignment of this Agreement than it would have had in the absence of
such assignment.  18.5. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Non-Competition Agreement, the Stamp Duty Deed and, at such
time as entered into, the Transition Services Agreement, the Conveyance
Instruments and the Transfer Agreements) (a) constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Assets and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
supersedes all prior negotiations and oral or written understandings, if any,
and (c) may not be amended or supplemented except by an instrument in writing
signed by both parties hereto. Neither party makes any representation or
warranty except as provided herein.    -101-     18.6. GOVERNING LAW:
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
substantive laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without
regard to its choice of law provisions.  18.7. NO RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES:
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any right on any person other
than the parties to it and their respective successors and assigns; nor is
anything in this Agreement intended to modify or discharge the obligation or
liability of any third person to any party to this Agreement, nor shall any
provision give any third person any right of subrogation or action over
against any party to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no employee (whether former, current or future) of either
Purchaser, Seller or any Purchased Subsidiary (or any beneficiary thereof)
shall be treated as a third party beneficiary or have any rights or interests
hereunder.  18.8. COUNTERPARTS: This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.  18.9. HEADINGS: The headings of the sections of this Agreement
and the table of contents at the forepart of this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not constitute a part hereof nor affect the rights
of the parties hereto.  18.10. TERMINATION; TERMINATION EVENTS; NOTICE OF
TERMINATION:   (a) Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned under any of the following circumstances:  
(i) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser at any time  prior
to the Closing Date;   (ii) by Seller if any of the conditions set forth in
Article XI shall  have become incapable of fulfillment at any time or are not
fulfilled at  Closing and shall not have been waived by Seller;   (iii) by
Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in Article X  shall have become
incapable of fulfillment at any time or are not fulfilled  at Closing and
shall not have been waived by Purchaser;   (iv) by either party if the
Closing has not occurred by the close of  business on July 31, 2002, other
than as a result of the breach of this  Agreement by the party seeking to so
terminate this Agreement; or   (v) by Purchaser, after June 15, 2002 if
Purchaser shall not have  obtained the funds contemplated in the Commitment
Letters, other than as a  result of the breach of Section 7.4 of this
Agreement by Purchaser.   (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement
by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to this Section 18.10, written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party and the transactions   
-102-     contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned, without
further action by any party. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are abandoned as provided herein:   (i) Purchaser shall return
all documents and copies and other  materials received from or on behalf of
Seller relating to the transactions  contemplated hereby, whether so obtained
before or after the execution  hereof, to Seller;   (ii) all confidential
information received by Purchaser with respect  to the Business shall be
treated in accordance with the Confidentiality  Agreement, which shall remain
in full force and effect notwithstanding the  termination of this Agreement;
and   (iii) this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and 
effect, except for the provisions of (i) Section 15.3 relating to the 
obligations of each of Purchaser and Seller to keep confidential certain 
information and data obtained by it, (ii) Section 7.5 relating to  publicity,
(iii) Section 18.3 relating to certain expenses, (iv) Section  18.1 relating
to broker\'s or finder\'s fees, and (v) this Section 18.10.  Nothing in this
Section 18.10 shall be deemed to release any party from any  liability for
any breach by such of the terms and provisions of this  Agreement occurring
prior to termination of this Agreement.   (c) If Purchaser exercises its
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 18.10(a)(v), then
Purchaser shall pay to Seller upon demand, $20 million, as payment of
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, to reimburse Seller for its time,
expense and lost opportunity costs of pursuing the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The parties hereto understand and agree that $20 million
is reasonable as liquidated damages in light of the costs and expenses that
would be incurred by the Seller of such a termination were to occur, and in
light of the difficulty of proving the amount of actual damages that would be
suffered by the Seller in such an event. Anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, the remedy provided by this Section 18.10(c)
shall be Seller\'s sole remedy and recourse against Purchaser in the event
Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 18.10(a)(v).  18.11.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION; NEGOTIATION; JURISDICTION:   (a) In the event of any
dispute or disagreement between Seller and Purchaser as to the interpretation
of any provision of this Agreement, the performance of obligations hereunder,
or any other disputed matter, such matter, upon written request of either
party, shall be referred to representatives of the parties for decision, each
party being represented by a senior executive officer who has no direct
operational responsibility for the matters contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Representatives"). The Representatives shall promptly meet in a good
faith effort to resolve the dispute. If the Representatives do not agree upon
a decision within thirty (30) calendar days after reference of the matter to
them, either Purchaser or Seller shall be free to exercise all remedies
otherwise available to them.   (b) Subject to Section 18.11(c), each of the
parties agrees that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any alleged breach hereof shall be referred
to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York of
any courts of the State of New York sitting in the City of New York, Borough
of    -103-     Manhattan pursuant to its rules and procedures. Either
party may bring an action in such Court and the other party shall hereby be
deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction within the State of New
York for such purpose and the jurisdiction of such Court and its rules, and
hereby waives any defense to any such action based on the doctrine of forum
non-conveniens.   (c) Nothing in this Section 18.11 shall prevent either
party from commencing proceedings against the other in any other court of
competent jurisdiction where the relief claimed in such proceedings is or
includes a bona fide claim for an injunction or other form of order
restraining the defendant from doing any act or thing, and whether such order
is temporary or interim or permanent.  18.12. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE: The
parties recognize that in the event that either party should refuse to
perform under any of the provisions of this Agreement, money damages alone
would not be adequate. The parties shall therefore be entitled, in addition
to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
including money damages, to obtain specific performance of such provisions.
In the event of any action to enforce such provisions specifically, the
parties hereby waive the defense that there is adequate remedy at
law.  18.13. REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL; INTERPRETATION: Seller and
Purchaser acknowledge that each of them has been represented by counsel in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the party
that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived.  18.14.
KNOWLEDGE OF SELLER: The term "Knowledge" as used with respect to Seller in
this Agreement means actual knowledge of the individuals listed on
Schedule 18.14.  18.15. DOLLAR AMOUNTS: All dollar amounts referred to in
this Agreement are in United States Dollars.  18.16. PASSAGE OF TITLE AND
RISK OF LOSS: Legal title, equitable title and risk of loss with respect to
the Target Assets, the Purchased Subsidiaries and the assets of the Purchased
Subsidiaries will not pass to Purchaser until such assets and subsidiaries
are transferred to Purchaser or its Designees.  18.17. WAIVER: Any party
may, by written notice to another party: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other actions of such other party;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations of such other party
contained in this Agreement; (c) waive any condition to its obligations set
forth in Article X or XI, as applicable; or (d) waive compliance of any
of the agreements of such other party contained in this Agreement or waiver
or consent to the modification of performance of any of the obligations of
such other party. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including,
without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, condition, or agreement contained herein.
The failure in any one or more instances of a party to insist upon
performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement,
to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement conferred, or the waiver
by said party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of    -104-     this Agreement shall not be construed as, or
constitute a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions,
rights or privileges, but the same shall continue and remain in full force
and effect.  18.18. SEVERABILITY: If any provision of this Agreement shall
finally be determined to be unlawful, then such provision will be deemed to
be severed from this Agreement and replaced by a lawful provision which
carries out, as closely as possible, the intention of the parties and
preserves the economic bargain contemplated by this Agreement, and, in such
case, each and every other provision of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect.  18.19. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: SELLER AND PURCHASER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLE WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.    -105-      IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed as
of the day and year first above written.    INVENSYS PLC   By: /s/ John
