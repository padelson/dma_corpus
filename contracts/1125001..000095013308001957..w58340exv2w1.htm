Company (the &#147;<I>Exchange Agent</I>&#148;), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Section&nbsp;2.3. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article&nbsp;2, the cash necessary to pay for the shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (the &#147;<I>Exchange
Fund</I>&#148;). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Such Merger Consideration
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent in (i)&nbsp;direct obligations of
the United States of America, (ii)&nbsp;obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest, (iii)&nbsp;commercial
paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moody&#146;s Investor Services, Inc. or

the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Exchange Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parent&#146;s obligation under this
Agreement to pay the Merger Consideration. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as
Parent otherwise directs.

but in any event not later than five Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the &#147;<I>Certificates</I>&#148;) whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2, (i)&nbsp;a letter
of transmittal (in customary form which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate entitle such holder to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;2 and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name

otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.3 the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to

registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article&nbsp;2, except as otherwise
provided by Law.

undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this Article&nbsp;2 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this Article&nbsp;2 would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such amounts shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this
Agreement.

<I>however</I>, that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in the absence of a Superior
Proposal unless such change is based upon information that is unknown to the Company Board as of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR VALUE RECEIVED, IOMAI CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<I>Company</I>&#148;), hereby promises
to pay to the order of INTERCELL AG, a joint stock corporation incorporated under the laws of the
Republic of Austria (the &#147;<I>Lender</I>&#148;), in lawful money of the United States and in immediately
available funds, the principal sum of FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS or, if less, the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all Loans made hereunder in accordance with Section&nbsp;6.13 of the Merger
Agreement (as defined below) by the Lender to the Company on or after the date hereof, in either
case as such principal amount may be increased further due to the compounding of interest in
accordance with Section 1(b) below, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in the
amounts, at the times, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Promissory Note (this &#147;<I>Note</I>&#148;). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings given to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May&nbsp;12, 2008 (the
"<I>Merger Agreement</I>&#148;), among the Lender, Zebra Merger Sub, Inc. and the Company. This Note is the
Interim Note referred to in Section&nbsp;6.13 of the Merger Agreement.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(a)&nbsp;Principal Repayment</B>. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be payable,
together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, immediately following the termination of the
Merger Agreement by either the Lender or the Company for any reason (the &#147;<I>Maturity Date</I>&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;Interest Payments</B>. The Company promises to pay interest in lawful money of the United
States of America on the sum of the daily outstanding principal amount of each Loan from the date
hereof until payment in full, which interest shall be payable at the fixed rate of 10% per annum
(the &#147;<I>Interest Rate</I>&#148;). Interest on each Loan shall be payable in cash at the Interest Rate to the
Lender, quarterly in arrears, on December&nbsp;31, March&nbsp;31, June&nbsp;30, and September&nbsp;30 in each year
(unless such day is not a Business Day, in which event on the next succeeding Business Day), with
the first such payment becoming due and payable on December&nbsp;31, 2008; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the
Company may, at its option, in lieu of a cash payment of interest, increase the principal amount of
the Loan by the amount of such cash payment. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the preceding
sentence on any such increased principal amount of such Loan. Interest shall be calculated on the
basis of a 365-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. If the principal amount hereof is
not paid in full when due and payable, interest at a rate of 12% per annum shall accrue on the
balance of any unpaid principal (and, to the extent permitted by law, any overdue payment of
interest); <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that in no event shall the rate of interest hereunder exceed the
applicable limits imposed by any applicable federal or state law.

due under this Note, second to interest accrued on this Note and third, if the amount of prepayment
exceeds the amount of all such expenses and accrued interest, to the payment of principal of this
Note. A prepayment of less than all of the unpaid principal amount of this Note shall not relieve
the Company of its obligation to make the scheduled payment of the balance of the principal amount
and any accrued and unpaid interest on this Note on the Maturity Date. The Company shall notify
the Lender in writing of its intention to prepay this Note at least five Business Days prior to any
such prepayment. Once given, any such notice shall be irrevocable and the Company shall be bound
