ARTICLE 2 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
 CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

 SECTION 2.1. _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each share of Merger Sub capital stock will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 2.2. _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Company Common Stock: 

   

 (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and (ii) any Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $6.60 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") from Parent. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a). The Company shall serve reasonably prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such 

    ##### 

  

    

demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) to pay for Appraisal Shares shall be returned to
Parent upon demand. 

   

 SECTION 2.3. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.3. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Such Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing, or a combination thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this Agreement to pay the Merger Consideration. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in any event not later than five Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2, (i) a letter of transmittal (in customary form which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate entitle such holder to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name 

    ##### 

  

    

the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in
accordance with this Section 2.3 the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.2. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders
of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as otherwise provided by Law. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making 

    ##### 

  

    

of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent. 

   

 SECTION 2.4. _Company Options_. Except as set forth on Section 2.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter: 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that each Option outstanding at the applicable time described below (i) issued under either the 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall be fully vested and exercisable no less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time and (ii) issued under the 2005 Incentive Plan that, under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan and the applicable Option agreement, will vest prior to the Effective Time shall be exercisable prior to the Effective Time. To the extent that an Option issued under the 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan that is vested and exercisable pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.4 or under the terms of the applicable Option Plan and the applicable Option agreement is not exercised prior to the Effective Time, such Option shall be cancelled and terminated, and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option. If the Option Consideration shall be zero or a negative number, the Option shall be cancelled and terminated and no such cash payment shall be due and owing. Except as otherwise provided below, any Option Consideration due and owing shall be paid by Parent and the Surviving Corporation as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable and in any event, within three Business Days following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Option Consideration otherwise payable such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. 

   

 (b) Each Option issued under the 2005 Incentive Plan that is vested under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan and the applicable Option agreement but is not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time and the holder of such cancelled and terminated Option shall receive as of the Effective Time a vested option to purchase shares of Parent (the " _Substituted Vested Option")_. Each Option issued under the 2005 Incentive Plan that, under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan and the applicable Option agreement, will not vest prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time and the holder of such cancelled and terminated Option shall receive as of the Effective Time an unvested option to purchase shares of Parent (the " _Substituted Unvested Option"_ ). A Substituted Unvested Option will vest on the same schedule as the corresponding Option under the 2005 Incentive Plan that was cancelled and terminated in exchange for such Substituted Unvested Option. However, a Substituted Unvested Option may be subject to accelerated vesting under the terms of an option holders employment or change in control 

    ##### 

  

    

agreement with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. For
the avoidance of doubt, the exercise price and number of shares subject to
the Substituted Vested Option and the Substituted Unvested Option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the objective that the substitution or
assumption of Options satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). The Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates
shall treat the Substituted Vested Options and the Substituted Unvested
Options for tax reporting and withholding purposes in accordance with the
regulations and other applicable guidance under Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make any amendments to the terms of the Stock Plans and obtain any consents from holders of Options that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any Option until any necessary consents are obtained. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all its Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock less (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option; " _Options_ " means any option granted, and, immediately before the Effective Time not exercised, expired or terminated, to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Plans; and " _Stock Plans_ " means the Companys 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and 2005 Incentive Plan. 

   

 SECTION 2.5. _Warrants_. No later than 15 calendar days prior to the record date applicable to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall deliver to each holder of a Warrant any notice regarding the Transactions as required by the Warrants. Each Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not exercised prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of the Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive (upon surrender of the warrant certificate) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the amount, if positive, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Warrant and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the obligations of the Company under the Warrants. As used in this Agreement, " _Warrant_ " means a Common Stock Purchase Warrant issued by the Company pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of March 2, 2007. 

   

 SECTION 2.6. _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger under the DGCL as promptly as commercially practicable. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the officers and directors of the Surviving 

    ##### 

  

    

Corporation are fully authorized in the name of each Constituent Corporation
or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action. 

   

 SECTION 2.7. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

     ##### 

  

    

Company Stockholder Vote (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") until and unless a

reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which it believes in good faith is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that

 (c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company and its Affiliates of each Person who is an employee or former employee of the Company immediately prior to the Closing (a " _Company Employee_ ") (to the same extent such service is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its Affiliates prior to the Closing) as service rendered to Parent or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder (but not benefit accrual); _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit. Company Employees shall also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in

sabbatical time of the Company Employees as of the Closing Date, in
accordance with the terms of such Company policies and Parent shall cause the
Company to provide such vacation and sabbatical time in accordance with the
terms of such Company policies but in no event will Parent be obligated to

and Merger Sub agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all such necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities.

Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to

The Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by the termination of this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. 

   

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the other Transactions are consummated. 

      ##### 

  

     

 (b) In the event that, after the date of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall be pending or shall have been made or remade to the Company or shall be pending or shall have been made or remade directly to its stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or (d) and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, any Takeover Proposal (replacing "15%" in the definition thereof with "50%") within 12 months of the date this Agreement is terminated (so long as, in the case of a transaction that has not been consummated within such period, such transaction is thereafter consummated); 

   

 (ii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall be pending or shall have been made or remade to the Company or shall be pending or shall have been made or remade directly to its stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter, (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(ii) and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (replacing "15%" in the definition thereof with "50%") within 12 months of the date this Agreement is terminated (so long as, in the case of a transaction that has not been consummated within such period, such transaction is thereafter consummated); 

   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (or by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or (d) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) following any time at which Parent was entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)); or 

   

 (iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h); 

  

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section
8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $6,000,000 (the
" _Termination Fee_ "). Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause
(i) or clause (ii) of this Section 8.3(b) shall be made to Parent promptly
following the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Takeover
Proposal referred to therein (and in any event not later than two Business
Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment following
such date); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iii) of this
Section 8.3(b) shall be made to Parent upon the earlier to occur of (A) the
date occurring 90 days following the termination of this Agreement by Parent
and (B) the consummation of a transaction contemplated by a Takeover
Proposal; and any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iv) of this
Section 8.3(b) shall be made to Parent in cash no later than 10 Business Days
following such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company has
not paid such amount in cash by the tenth Business Day following termination,
then the Company shall immediately provide to Parent, in lieu of cash, the
number of newly issued shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Company
Common Stock equal to (A) $6,000,000 divided by (B) the average of the
closing sale prices for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq, as reported in
_The Wall Street Journal_ for each of the 15 consecutive trading days ending
with the trading day immediately preceding the date of this 

     ##### 

  

    

Agreement (the " _Average Price_ "). The Company shall promptly, and in any
event within two Business Days following conclusion of the ten Business Day
period following termination, prepare and file with the SEC, and have
declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable following such filing, a
resale shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering the shares of Company
Common Stock issued to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) pursuant to a
registration rights agreement (in customary form) to be agreed upon and
entered into by the Company and Parent in connection with such issuance. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such shelf
registration statement continuously effective, in compliance with the
Securities Act and usable for resale of such shares until the earlier of (y)
the day on which Parent no longer holds any shares issued pursuant to this
Section 8.3(b) and (z) the first anniversary of the issuance of such
shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the number of shares
issued to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) exceed the number of shares
equal to 19.9% of the Companys Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if under any
circumstance the Average Price multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) is less than $6,000,000,
then the Company shall pay to Parent such difference in cash on the day of
the issuance of the shares to Parent. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company, prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote, receives an unsolicited, written Takeover Proposal made in circumstances not involving an intentional breach or knowing violation of Section 6.8, and the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of Cowen or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to enable it to fund the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iv) in cash within 10 Business Days following the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, Section 8.1(h), it being understood that such reasonable best efforts shall include seeking and negotiating the terms of a financing from third parties, including financial institutions and the party making the Takeover Proposal (such financing may include the sale of securities of the Company or the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company) for purposes of funding the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iv); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such financing shall (i) be consummated, (ii) impose any obligations whatsoever on the Company, or (iii) result in the payment (or obligation to pay) by the Company of any fees or expenses unless and until this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, Section 8.1(h). 

   

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreement contained in Section 8.3(b) is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without that agreement, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that in the event that Parent receives a Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the receipt by Parent of such amount shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for Parent and Merger Sub, and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of, any termination of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing to the contrary in this Section 8.3(d) shall relieve any party from liability, or constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for, any intentional breach of this Agreement prior to a termination of this Agreement. If the Company fails to make payment of such fee within the applicable time period 

     ##### 

  

    

specified in Section 8.3(b) and Parent commences a suit to collect such fee,
the Company shall indemnify and reimburse Parent for its fees and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit
and shall pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date the fee
was payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b). 

   

 SECTION 8.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub and the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made that in any way materially adversely affects the rights of such stockholders (other than a termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions hereof) without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

   

 SECTION 8.5. _Waiver_. Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by each such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of May 12, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ "),
among Intercell AG, a joint stock corporation incorporated under the laws of
the Republic of Austria (" _Parent_ "), and each of the stockholders listed
on Schedule I to this Agreement  _(each, a " _Stockholder_ " and,
collectively, the " _Stockholders_ ")._ 

  

 _Introduction_  

   

 Parent, Zebra Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Iomai Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will be the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "). 

   

 As of the date hereof, each Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of the number of shares (the " _Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), set forth opposite such Stockholders name on Schedule I to this Agreement (such Shares, together with any other shares of capital stock of the Company acquired by such Stockholder after the date hereof and during the term of this Agreement (including through the exercise of any stock options, warrants or any other convertible or exchangeable securities or similar instruments), being collectively referred to herein as such Stockholders " _Subject Shares_ "). 

   

 As a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that (i) each Stockholder agree, and each Stockholder is willing to agree, to exchange such Stockholders Subject Shares for either (A) shares of common stock with no par value ( _St uckaktien_) and each share representing a pro rata amount of 1 of the aggregate nominal value of the common stock of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger or (B) cash immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, in each case pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (the " _Share Exchange_ "), and (ii) each Stockholder that is party to the Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), among Parent and such Stockholders, agrees, and each such Stockholder is willing to agree, to vote such Stockholders Subject Shares in favor of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. 

   

 In furtherance of the Share Exchange, Parent intends to increase its share capital (the " _Capital Increase_ "), by issuing the Exchange Shares to the Stockholders under exclusion of the statutory subscription rights of the shareholders of Parent. 

   

 In consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE 1 
 DEFINED TERMS 

   

 SECTION 1.1. _Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE 2 
 SHARE EXCHANGE 

   

 SECTION 2.1. _Share Exchange_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Stockholder shall, pursuant to a Contribution-in-Kind Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the " _Contribution-in-Kind Agreement_ "), exchange, assign, transfer and deliver all of such Stockholders Subject Shares to Parent, or to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent designated by Parent, at the Share Exchange Closing; and, in exchange therefor, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.6, Parent shall issue, exchange, sell and deliver to each Stockholder a number of shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Shares_ ") equal to the product of (a) the number of such Stockholders Subject Shares and (b) the Exchange Ratio. As used in this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means $6.60 U.S. Dollars divided by the Fair Market Value. As used in this Agreement, " _Fair Market Value_ " means the closing sale price for the Parent Common Stock on the Vienna Stock Exchange on the Share Exchange Closing Date, with such amount being converted to U.S. Dollars using the conversion rate from Euros to U.S. Dollars published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the Share Exchange Closing Date. 

   

 SECTION 2.2. _Share Exchange Closing_. 

   

 (a) The closing of the Share Exchange (the " _Share Exchange Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (East Coast time) on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Share Exchange Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived on the Share Exchange Closing Date), at the offices of Covington and Burling LLP, 1201 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20004, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date upon which the Share Exchange Closing occurs, the " _Share Exchange Closing Date_ "). 

   

 (b) At the Share Exchange Closing, each Stockholder shall deliver to Parent certificates representing such Stockholders Subject Shares, together with stock powers, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, endorsed in blank and signed by each such Stockholder, and promptly shall take all other actions reasonably necessary to facilitate the recordation of Parent as the owner of such Subject Shares in the books and records of the Company. Pursuant to Section 5.5, and except as otherwise provided in Section 5.6, as soon as reasonably practicable following the registration of the Capital Increase in the Commercial Register, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders their respective number of Exchange Shares by way of book entry (electronic transfer).

ARTICLE 4 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT 

   

 Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Stockholders as follows: 

   

 SECTION 4.1. _Organization_. Parent is a duly organized and validly existing stock corporation under the laws of the Republic of Austria and has all requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals, the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 SECTION 4.2. _Capitalization_. The capitalization of Parent is as described in Parents most recent periodic report filed with any applicable regulatory authority as of the date 

    ##### 

  

    

of such report. Except with respect to statutory rights under Austrian law
that will be excluded by resolution of the management board and the
supervisory board of Parent in accordance with the authorization granted by
the stockholders meeting dated 15 June 2007 in order to permit
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
issue and sale of the Exchange Shares will not obligate the Company to issue
any other equity securities to any third party (other than the Stockholders)
and will not result in a right of any holder of Parents securities to adjust
the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under such securities. 

   

 SECTION 4.3. _Regulatory Reports_. Parent has filed all material reports required to be filed by it under applicable Austrian law or with respect to any agency or self regulatory authority or exchange rules to which Parent is subject for the two years preceding the date hereof (or such shorter period as Parent was required by law to file such material) (the foregoing materials, including the exhibits and amendments thereto, being collectively referred to herein as the " _Regulatory Reports_ ") on a timely basis or has received a valid extension of such time of filing and has filed any such Regulatory Reports prior to the expiration of any such extension. As of their respective dates, the Regulatory Reports complied in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable laws, rules and regulations and provided a true and fair view of Parents assets and liabilities, financial condition and results of operation and described the material risks and material contingent liabilities to which Parent was exposed. Parent has published all ad hoc information required to be published by it under applicable Austrian law and such information was correct in all material respects and not, in light of the circumstances existing at the time, misleading when published. The financial statements of Parent as of December 31, 2007 included in the Regulatory Reports, if any, comply in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and applicable laws, rules and regulations with respect thereto as in effect as of December 31, 2007. 

   

 SECTION 4.4. _Governmental Authority_. Except for regular audits by tax authorities, to the knowledge of Parent, there has not been and there is not pending or contemplated, any investigation by any governmental agency, exchange or self-regulatory authority involving Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any current or former director or officer of Parent. No governmental agency, exchange, court or self-regulatory authority has issued any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of any approval necessary for the Stockholders to enter into transactions with respect to the Exchange Shares from and after the date hereof. 

   

 SECTION 4.5. _Authorization; No Conflict_  

   

 (a) Parent has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to which it is a party and to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent a party), the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub.

    ##### 

  

    

their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, except for the approval of
the Merger by Parent as the owner of all the outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub. Each of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Voting
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub (to the extent a party) and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Stockholders (to the extent a
party), the Company (to the extent a party) and the other parties thereto,
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with their respective
terms, except in each case as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law). 

   

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub (to the extent a party), nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions nor compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions herein or therein will (i) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Merger Sub or any of the organizational documents of Parent or (ii) subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (c) below, violate any Judgment or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets other than any such event described in this clause (ii) which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is necessary to be obtained or made by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with Parents or Merger Subs (to the extent a party) execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreement, or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions, except for those identified in Section 4.3(c) of the Merger Agreement and the registration of the Capital Increase in the Vienna Commercial Register ( _Firmenbuch_ ) (the " _Commercial Register_ ").

 SECTION 4.7. _Valid Issuance_. The Exchange Shares have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on behalf of Parent. When registered in the Commercial Register and issued and sold against receipt of the consideration therefor, the Exchange Shares will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and free of preemptive rights, other than statutory rights under Austrian law that will be excluded by resolution of the management board and the supervisory board of Parent in accordance with the authorization granted by the stockholders meeting dated 15 June 2007 in order to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Parent, Zebra Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Iomai Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will be the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "). 

  

 As of the date hereof, each Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of the number of shares (the " _Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), set forth opposite such Stockholders name on Schedule I attached hereto (such Shares, together with any other shares of capital stock of the Company acquired by such Stockholder after the date hereof and during the term of this Agreement (including through the exercise of any stock options, warrants or any other convertible or exchangeable securities or similar instruments), being collectively referred to herein as such Stockholders " _Subject Shares_ "). 

  

 As a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that (i) each Stockholder agree, and each Stockholder is willing to agree, to the matters set forth herein and (ii) each Stockholder that is party to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Exchange Agreemen_ t"), among Parent and such Stockholders, agree, and each such Stockholder is willing to agree, to exchange such Stockholders Subject Shares for shares of common stock of Parent pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Exchange Agreement. 

  

 In consideration of the foregoing and the agreements set forth below, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

 Section 1\. _Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 Section 2\. _Voting of Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Voting_. Until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, each Stockholder hereby agrees (severally with respect to itself and not jointly) to vote (or cause to be voted) all of such Stockholders Subject Shares, at every annual, special or other meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and at any adjournment or adjournments thereof, or pursuant to any consent in lieu of a meeting or otherwise: 

  

 (i) in favor of the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Transactions, and any actions required in furtherance thereof; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of the Company under the Merger Agreement; and 

  

 (iii) against (A) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, rights offering, reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Merger), (B) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets or capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (C) any action that is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, prevent, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Merger or the Transactions. 

  

 (b) _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_.

Each Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Stockholders execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 2(b) is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Subject to this Section 2(b), this grant of proxy is coupled with an interest and may under no circumstances be revoked. Each Stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully do or cause to be done in accordance herewith.

There are no outstanding options, shares of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or other rights to acquire from such Stockholder, or obligations of such Stockholder to sell or to dispose of, any shares of Company Common Stock.

Parent has duly and validly executed this Agreement and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

PROMISSORY NOTE 

   

May 12, 2008 

   

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, IOMAI CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby promises to pay to the order of INTERCELL AG, a joint stock corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Austria (the " _Lender_ "), in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans made hereunder in accordance with Section 6.13 of the Merger Agreement (as defined below) by the Lender to the Company on or after the date hereof, in either case as such principal amount may be increased further due to the compounding of interest in accordance with Section 1(b) below, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in the amounts, at the times, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Promissory Note (this " _Note_ "). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 12, 2008 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among the Lender, Zebra Merger Sub, Inc. and the Company. This Note is the Interim Note referred to in Section 6.13 of the Merger Agreement. 

  

1\. Payment; Principal and Interest. 

   

 (a) Principal Repayment. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, immediately following the termination of the Merger Agreement by either the Lender or the Company for any reason (the " _Maturity Date_ "). 

  

 (b) Interest Payments. The Company promises to pay interest in lawful money of the United States of America on the sum of the daily outstanding principal amount of each Loan from the date hereof until payment in full, which interest shall be payable at the fixed rate of 10% per annum (the " _Interest Rate_ "). Interest on each Loan shall be payable in cash at the Interest Rate to the Lender, quarterly in arrears, on December 31, March 31, June 30, and September 30 in each year (unless such day is not a Business Day, in which event on the next succeeding Business Day), with the first such payment becoming due and payable on December 31, 2008; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may, at its option, in lieu of a cash payment of interest, increase the principal amount of the Loan by the amount of such cash payment. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the preceding sentence on any such increased principal amount of such Loan. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. If the principal amount hereof is not paid in full when due and payable, interest at a rate of 12% per annum shall accrue on the balance of any unpaid principal (and, to the extent permitted by law, any overdue payment of interest); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the rate of interest hereunder exceed the applicable limits imposed by any applicable federal or state law. 

  

 (c) Limitations on Interest Rates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Note to the contrary, the total liability for payments in the nature of interest shall not exceed the applicable limits imposed by any applicable federal or state interest rate laws. If any payments 

   ##### 

  

    

in the nature of interest, additional interest and other charges made
hereunder are held to be in excess of the applicable limits imposed by any
applicable federal or state law, the amount held to be in excess shall be
considered payment of principal under this Note and the
indebtedness evidenced hereby shall be reduced by such amount so that the
total liability for payments in the nature of interest, additional interest
and other charges shall not exceed the applicable limits imposed by any
applicable federal or state interest rate laws. 

 

2\. Place of Payments; No Setoff. All amounts payable hereunder shall be made
for the account of the Lender at such place as the Lender may designate to
the Company in writing from time to time. Each payment hereunder, whether for
principal, interest or otherwise, shall be made without setoff, counterclaim,
defense, condition or reservation of right. 

  

3\. Prepayments. This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time without premium or penalty. Any such prepayment shall be
applied first to the payment of expenses due under this Note, second to
interest accrued on this Note and third, if the amount of prepayment exceeds
the amount of all such expenses and accrued interest, to the payment of
principal of this Note. A prepayment of less than all of the unpaid principal
amount of this Note shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to make
the scheduled payment of the balance of the principal amount and any accrued
and unpaid interest on this Note on the Maturity Date. The Company shall
notify the Lender in writing of its intention to prepay this Note at least
five Business Days prior to any such prepayment. Once given, any such notice
shall be irrevocable and the Company shall be bound to make the prepayment
specified in such notice. 

  

4\. Representations and Warranties. The Company hereby warrants and represents
to the Lender as follows: 

   

 (a) Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all requisite power and authority necessary to enable it to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and to execute, deliver and perform the terms of this Note. 

  

 (b) Note Authorized; Binding Obligations. The execution, delivery and performance of this Note have been duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and this Note constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. 

  

 (c) No Conflict; Legal Compliance. The execution, delivery and payment of this Note will not: (i) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the Company Charter Documents; (ii) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with any provisions of, or result in the loss of any benefit under or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination, cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets owned or operated by the Company under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, contract, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation of any kind to which the Company is a party or by

 (vi) The Company uses the proceeds of the Loans for any purpose other than its working capital needs in the ordinary course of its business and the payment of expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Transactions (excluding payment of the Termination Fee); or 

   

 (vii) After the date hereof, the Company grants any Person other than the Lender a Lien on all or any substantial part of its assets. 

 

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, all unpaid principal,

the Lender so long as such Event of Default is continuing in the case of
Section 5(a)(i), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii), or automatically, in the case of
Section 5(a)(ii) or (iii), be immediately due and payable by the Company;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Company fails to provide written notice
to the Lender within 24 hours of the Company becoming aware of the occurrence
of an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii), then
all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing hereunder
shall be immediately due and payable by the Company. In addition to the
remedies herein, upon the occurrence or existence of any Event of Default,
the Lender may exercise any other right, power or remedy granted to it by the
Merger Agreement or otherwise permitted to it by law, either by suit
in equity or by action at law, or both. 

   

 (b) If the Company has not paid any amount owed to the Lender in cash within 14 days following the date such payment is due pursuant to Section 1(a) or Section 5(a), as the case may be, then the Company shall immediately provide to the Lender, in lieu of cash, the number of newly issued shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Company Common Stock equal to (i) the amount of all unpaid principal, accrued interest and other amounts owing hereunder divided by (ii) the average daily volume weighted average price for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq, as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. for each of the 10 consecutive trading days ending with the trading day immediately preceding the last trading day in such 14-day period (the " _VWAP_ "). The Company shall promptly, and in any event within two Business Days following conclusion of the 14-day period following the date such payment is due pursuant to Section 1(a) or Section 5(a), prepare and file with the SEC, and have declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable following such filing, a resale shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering the shares of Company Common Stock issued to the Lender pursuant to this Section 5(b) pursuant to a registration rights agreement (in customary form) to be agreed upon and entered into by the Company and the Lender in connection with such issuance. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such shelf registration statement continuously effective, in compliance with the Securities Act and usable for resale of such shares until the earlier of (y) the day on which the Lender no longer holds any shares issued pursuant to this Section 5(b) and (z) the first anniversary of the issuance of such shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the number of shares issued to the Lender pursuant to this Section 5(b) exceed the number of shares equal to 19.9% of the Companys Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this Note; _provided_ , _however_ , that if under any circumstance the VWAP multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to this 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 5(b) is less than the amount of all unpaid principal, accrued interest
and other amounts owing hereunder, then the Company shall pay to the Lender
such difference in cash on the day of the issuance of the shares to the
Lender. 

 

6\. Waiver; Representations and Expenses. The Company waives presentment,
notice of dishonor, protest and notice of protest of this Note and all other
notices or demands in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance,
default or endorsement of this Note, and shall pay all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of collection when incurred by the Lender,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. No
extension nor indulgence granted from time to time shall be construed as a
novation of this Note or as a reinstatement of the indebtedness evidenced
hereby or as a waiver of the rights of the Lender herein.

pursuant to this Note shall be in writing (including by facsimile
transmission; provided that any notice or demand transmitted by facsimile

10\. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Note shall be
interpreted in such a manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable under the
applicable law of any jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, in case any provision of this Note shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable under the applicable law of any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions, or of such
provision in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. 

  

11\. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification, forbearance or waiver
of any provision of this Note, and no consent with respect to any departure
by the Company therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the Lender and the Company. 

  

12\. Governing Law. This Note shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof. 

    ##### 

  

    

13\. Entire Agreement. This Note and Section 6.13 of the Merger Agreement
constitute the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and all prior promissory notes and all
prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, understandings,
representations and statements with respect thereto are merged into, and
replaced and superseded by this Note. 

  

14\. Waiver of Jury Trial. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
Company, by execution hereof, and the Lender, by acceptance hereof,
knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waive any right they may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on this Note, or arising out
of, under or in connection with this Note or any agreement contemplated to be
executed in connection with this Note, or any litigation arising out of any
course of conduct, course of dealing, statements (whether verbal or written)
or actions of any party with respect hereto. This provision is a material
inducement to the Lender to accept this Note.
