equal $36.80 multiplied by the product of 20% and the number of shares of
FOBB Common Stock that are issued, from and after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, pursuant to (A) purchases under the FOBB Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, but only to the extent set forth in Section 7.16(b) or
the exercise of FOBB Options outstanding as of the date hereof and (B) the
conversion of DSUs and RSUs outstanding as of the date hereof to shares of
FOBB Common Stock (collectively the " _Additional FOBB Shares_ "), and (3)
the Additional Consideration under Section 9.1(j)(ii) that is in the form of
cash.

  



  

(ii) " _Aggregate FOBB Share Amount_ " shall equal 10,026,186 shares of FOBB
Common Stock; provided, however, that the Aggregate FOBB Share Amount shall
be increased by virtue of the issuance of the Additional FOBB Shares.

  



  

(iii) " _Aggregate MBFI Share Amount_ " shall, subject to Section 3.2(g), be
equal to the aggregate of (1) 8,325,745 shares of MBFI Common Stock, (2) such
additional number of shares of MBFI Common Stock as shall equal 1.038
multiplied by the product of 80% and the number of Additional FOBB Shares and
(3) the Additional Consideration under Section 9.1(j)(ii) that is in the form
of MBFI Common Stock.

  



  

(iv) " _Exchange Ratio_ " means that number of shares of MBFI Common Stock as
shall be obtained by dividing the Per Share Amount by the Final MBFI Share
Value, rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share.

  



  

(v) " _Final MBFI Share Value_ " means the arithmetic average of the 4:00
p.m. Eastern Time closing sales prices of MBFI Common Stock reported on the
Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding but not
including the trading day prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

(vi) " _Final Transaction Value_ " means the sum of (A) the Aggregate Cash
Amount and (B) the product obtained by multiplying the Aggregate MBFI Share
Amount by the Final MBFI Share Value.

  



  

(vii) " _Per Share Amount_ " means the amount obtained by dividing the Final
Transaction Value by the Aggregate FOBB Share Amount.

  



  

(f) _Adjustment to Aggregate MBFI Share Amount_. In the event MBFI changes
(or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for
the exchange of, shares of MBFI Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to
the outstanding MBFI Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior
to the

  



        
   

  



  

Effective Time, the Aggregate MBFI Share Amount shall be proportionately and
appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(g) _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(i) Each outstanding share of FOBB Common Stock the holder of which has
perfected his right of appraisal under the DGCL and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by the DGCL. FOBB shall give MBFI prompt notice upon
receipt by FOBB of any such demands for payment of the fair value of such
shares of FOBB Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any other
instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any shareholder duly making
such demand being hereinafter called a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), and
MBFI shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands. FOBB shall not, except with the prior
written consent of MBFI, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any
other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect
appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting
Shares shall be made in cash by the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(ii) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or
prior to the Effective Time, such holders shares of FOBB Common Stock shall
be converted into a right to receive cash or MBFI Common Stock in accordance
with the applicable provisions of this Article III. If such holder shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his
right to such payment after the Effective Time (or the Election Deadline),
each share of FOBB Common Stock of such holder shall be treated as a Non-
Election Share.

  



  

(h) _Cancellation of FOBB Common Stock_. After the Effective Time, shares
of FOBB Common Stock shall be no longer outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter by operation of
this Section 3.1 represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration (or
as to Dissenting Shares, such rights as provided by the DGCL) and any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any dividends
or distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that were
declared or made by FOBB on such shares of FOBB Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  



  

3.2 _Election Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _General Provisions_. Holders of FOBB Common Stock may elect to receive
shares of MBFI Common Stock or cash (in either case without interest) in
exchange for their shares of FOBB Common Stock in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein. Shares of FOBB Common Stock as to which a Cash
Election (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been made are referred
to herein as " _Cash Election Shares_." Shares of FOBB Common Stock

  



        
   

  



  

as to which a Stock Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed
Election) are referred to as " _Stock Election Shares_." Shares of FOBB
Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an
Election Form is not returned properly completed) are referred to herein as
"Non- Election Shares." For purposes of this Article III, any Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares, and the holders thereof
shall in no event receive consideration comprised of MBFI Common Stock with
respect to such shares; provided; however, that for purposes of making
the proration calculations provided for in this Section 3.2, only
Dissenting Shares as existing at the Effective Time shall be deemed Cash
Election Shares.

  



  

(b) _Election Form and Transmittal Materials_. An election form and other
appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent),
in such form as FOBB and MBFI shall mutually agree (" _Election Form_ "),
shall be mailed no more than 40 business days and no less than 20 business
days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or on such earlier date as MBFI
and FOBB shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of
record of FOBB Common Stock as of five business days prior to the Mailing
Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). Each Election Form shall permit
such holder, subject to the allocation and election procedures set forth in
this Section 3.2, (i) to elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of
the shares of FOBB Common Stock held by such holder, (ii) to elect to receive
the Stock Consideration for all of such shares, (iii) elect to receive the
Stock Consideration for a part of such holders FOBB Common Stock and the
Cash Consideration for the remaining part of such holders FOBB Common Stock,
or (iv) to indicate that such record holder has no preference as to the
receipt of cash or MBFI Common Stock for such shares. A holder of record of
shares of FOBB Common Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in
another representative capacity (an " _Agent_ ") may submit multiple Election
Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers all the shares of FOBB
Common Stock held by such Agent for a particular beneficial owner. Any shares
of FOBB Common Stock with respect to which the holder thereof shall not, as
of the Election Deadline, have made an election by submission to the Exchange
Agent of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-
Election Shares.

  



  

(c) _Election Deadline_. To be effective, a properly completed Election Form
shall be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Central
time, on the 25th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date
as MBFI and FOBB may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "); provided,
however, that the Election Deadline may not occur on or after the Effective
Date. FOBB shall use its reasonable efforts to make available up to two
separate Election Forms, or such additional Election Forms as MBFI
may permit, to all Persons who become holders of record of FOBB Common
Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the
2nd business day prior to the Election Deadline. FOBB shall provide to the
Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as
specified herein. An election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly
completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary
affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing
all shares of FOBB Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with
duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. If an
FOBB shareholder either (i) does not submit a

  



        
   

  



  

properly completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its
Election Form prior to the Election Deadline (without later submitting a
properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline), the shares
of FOBB Common Stock held by such shareholder shall be designated as Non-
Election Shares. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice to the
Exchange Agent only if such notice of revocation or change is actually
received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline. MBFI
shall cause the Certificate or Certificates relating to any revoked Election
Form to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the
Election Form to the Exchange Agent. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have discretion to
determine when any election, modification or revocation is received and
whether any such election, modification or revocation has been properly made.
All elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is
notified in writing by MBFI or FOBB, upon exercise by MBFI or FOBB of its
respective or their mutual rights to terminate this Agreement to the
extent provided under Section 9.1, that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with Section 9.1.

  



  

(d) _Stock Conversion Number_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained
in this Agreement, the total number of shares of FOBB Common Stock to be
converted into Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii) (the "
_Stock Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (x) the Aggregate MBFI Share Amount by (y) the Exchange Ratio.
All of the other shares of FOBB Common Stock shall be converted into Cash
Consideration (in each case, excluding shares of FOBB Common Stock to be
canceled as provided in Section 3.1(b)).

  



  

(e) _Excess Stock Election Shares_. If the aggregate number of shares of
FOBB Common Stock with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made
(the " _Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then
all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and
Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right
to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number
of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the
Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders Stock
Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration.

  



  

(f) _Excess Cash Election Shares_. If the Stock Election Number is less than
the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number
exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "
_Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and
Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

  



  

(i) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of

  



        
   

  



  

which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number
of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration; or

  



  

(ii) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall
convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number
exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of
which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number
of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

  



  

(g) _Adjustment to Preserve Tax Treatment_. In the event that the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the product of (i) the Aggregate MBFI Share Amount
and (ii) the Final MBFI Share Value by (y) the sum of the Aggregate Cash
Amount and the product of (i) the Aggregate MBFI Share Amount and (ii) the
Final MBFI Share Value, is less than 0.45, the Aggregate MBFI Share Amount
shall be increased by the Share Adjustment Amount (as defined in this Section
3.2.(g)) and the Aggregate Cash Amount shall be decreased by the product of
(x) the Final MBFI Share Value and (y) the Share Adjustment Amount, where the
" _Share Adjustment Amount_ " shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the difference obtained by subtracting (i) the product of (a)
0.45 and (b) the sum of the Aggregate Cash Amount and the product of (1) the
Aggregate MBFI Share Amount and (2) the Final MBFI Share Value from (ii) the
product of (a) the Aggregate MBFI Share Amount and (b) the Final MBFI
Share Value by (y) the Final MBFI Share Value.  In the event that the
Aggregate MBFI Share Amount and the Aggregate Cash Amount are adjusted as
provided for in this Section 3.2.(g), all references in this Agreement to the
"Aggregate MBFI Share Amount" and the "Aggregate Cash Amount" shall refer to
the Aggregate MBFI Share Amount and the Aggregate Cash Amount as adjusted in
this Section 3.2.(g).

  



  

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
MBFI Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to MBFI Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest,
and such fractional share interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of MBFI. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, MBFI shall pay to each former holder of FOBB
Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of
MBFI Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the Final MBFI Share
Value. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all shares
of FOBB Common Stock owned by a FOBB shareholder shall be combined so as to
calculate the maximum number of whole shares of MBFI Common Stock issuable to
such FOBB shareholder.

  



  

3.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration to Exchange Agent; Payment of Merger
Consideration Relating to Certificates Surrendered at or Prior to the
Election Deadline_. Prior to the Effective Time, MBFI shall deliver to the
Exchange Agent the Aggregate Merger

  



        
   

  



  

Consideration (less the Cash Consideration applicable to Dissenting Shares)
which shall consist of (i) certificates representing the Aggregate MBFI Share
Amount and (ii) the Aggregate Cash Amount less the Cash Consideration
applicable to Dissenting Shares (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). On
an "as required" basis, MBFI shall promptly and timely tender to the Exchange
Agent additional cash funds required for the payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares in the Merger, which amounts when paid shall constitute a
part of the Exchange Fund. As soon as practicable after the Effective Date,
but not later than the 5th business day after the Effective Date, the
Exchange Agent shall tender to each shareholder of FOBB, who
properly surrendered Certificates to the Exchange Agent with an Election Form
at or prior to the Election Deadline (x) a certificate representing that
number of shares of MBFI Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of
FOBB Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.1 or 3.2 hereof, (y) a check representing that amount of cash (if
any) to which such former holder of FOBB Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 or 3.2 hereof and (z) a
check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a
fractional share of MBFI Common Stock, which such former holder has the right
to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3.2, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares.  Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Person
identified by FOBB pursuant to Section 7.7 as a Rule 145 Affiliate shall not
be exchanged for shares of MBFI Common Stock until MBFI has received a
written agreement from such Person as specified in Section 7.7.

  



  

3.4 _Exchange and Other Procedures Relating to Certificates Surrendered after
the Election Deadline_.

  



  

(a) _Transmittal and Deliveries_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Date, but not later than five (5) business days thereafter, with
respect to FOBB shareholders (i) whose addresses have been furnished to MBFI
or the Exchange Agent on or prior to the Effective Date and (ii) who did not
surrender or improperly surrendered their Certificates to the Exchange Agent
by the Election Deadline, MBFI shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each
such shareholder transmittal materials (which shall specify that risk of loss
and title to Certificates shall pass only upon acceptance of such
Certificates by MBFI or the Exchange Agent) for use in exchanging such
shareholders Certificates for the Stock Consideration and/or the Cash
Consideration, whichever is applicable. Upon proper delivery to the Exchange
Agent of Certificates (or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to MBFI and the
Exchange Agent, if any of such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed)
owned by such shareholder, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to such
shareholder the Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration applicable
thereto, and if appropriate, a check for any cash in lieu of a fractional
share interest. No interest will be paid with respect to any of the
foregoing. Certificates surrendered for exchange by a Person identified by
FOBB pursuant to Section 7.7 as a Rule 145 Affiliate shall not be exchanged
for the Stock Consideration until MBFI has received a written agreement from
such Person as specified in Section 7.7. MBFI and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of FOBB to establish the
identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article III, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate, MBFI or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deposit any consideration in

  



        
   

  



  

respect thereof in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be
relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

  



  

(b) _Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to MBFI Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
with a record date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid with
respect to any unsurrendered or improperly surrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Stock Consideration
in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.4. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section 3.4,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of MBFI Common Stock such holder had
the right to receive upon the proper surrender of the applicable Certificate.

  



  

(c) _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_.  If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed
to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate,
and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by
appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such
Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the
record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(d) _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of FOBB of the FOBB Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent or MBFI, they shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.4.

  



  

3.5 _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the six month period
after the Effective Time, MBFI shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund which had been made
available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates
(including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all cash funds made available to it), and
thereafter holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look to MBFI (subject
to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates held by them.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither MBFI
nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public
official pursuant any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

  



  

3.6 _Withholding_. MBFI or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of FOBB Common Stock
such amounts as MBFI

  



         
  

  



  

(or any of its affiliates) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To
the extent that such amounts are property withheld by MBFI or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the FOBB Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by MBFI or the
Exchange Agent.

representation or warranty which specifically relates to a specified date,
which only need be so correct as of such specified date.

  



  

5.1 _Standard_. No representation or warranty of FOBB contained in this
Article V shall be deemed not complete, untrue or incorrect, and FOBB shall
not be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence
of the existence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact,

circumstances or events has had or is reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on FOBB, disregarding for these purposes (x) any qualification
or exception for, or reference to, materiality in any such representation or
warranty and (y) any use of the terms "material", "materially", "in all
material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or similar terms or phrases in
any such representation or warranty. The foregoing standard shall not apply
(a) as of the date of this Agreement to representations and warranties
contained in Sections 5.2 (except as provided in subpart (b) below), 5.3(a),
5.4 (except as to the licensing and qualification in other jurisdictions),
5.5(b)(i) (relating solely to FOBB and OB Bank), 5.6(a), 5.7, 5.8(e),
5.12(b), (c) and (d), 5.13, and 5.17 which representations and warranties

respects at all times.

  



  

5.2 _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of FOBB consists of
(i) 16,000,000 shares of FOBB Common Stock of which, as of the date hereof,
(A) 10,026,186 are issued and outstanding, together with the Rights (the "
_FOBB Shareholder Rights_ ") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated
as of May 4, 1999, between FOBB and OB Bank, as Rights Agent (the " _Rights

Shareholder Rights so that the entering into of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby (individually or
in conjunction with any other event) do not and will not result in the
ability of any Person to exercise any FOBB Shareholder Rights under the
Rights Agreement or enable or require the FOBB Shareholders Rights to
separate from the shares of FOBB Common Stock to which they are attached or
to be triggered or become exercisable or redeemable. FOBB does not maintain a

FOBB or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

5.23 _Loan Portfolio_. Each loan reflected as an asset on the FOBB
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005 which are included
in FOBBs Securities Documents, and each loan originated or acquired by FOBB
or any of its Subsidiaries thereafter, is (or will be) evidenced by
appropriate and sufficient documentation and constitutes (or will constitute)
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the
enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws or equitable
principles or doctrines. All such loans are, and the loans held at the
Effective Date will be, free and clear of any Lien (other than the Lien of
the FHLB to secure FHLB borrowings). All loan files are complete in all
material respects and contain all notes, leases and other evidences of
indebtedness, lease agreements, certificates, security agreements, mortgages,
deeds of trust, guarantees, UCC financing statements, and similar documents
evidencing collateral or other financial accommodations relating to the
loans. None of the obligations represented by the loan documents have been
modified, altered, forgiven, discharged or otherwise disposed of, except as
indicated in the loan file or as a result of bankruptcy or other debtor
relief laws of general application. The collateral securing each loan was in
existence at the time funds were advanced or an interest was taken in such
collateral as reflected in the loan file. All security interests granted in
favor of the lender of each loan as reflected in the loan documents have been
property perfected. None of the loans are, and none of the loans held at the
Effective Date will be, subject

financial statements as of December 31, 2005 which are included in FOBBs
Securities Documents and none of the investment securities since acquired by
FOBB or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any restriction, whether
contractual or statutory, which impairs the ability of FOBB or any of its
Subsidiaries to freely dispose of such investment at any time, other than
those restrictions imposed on securities held to maturity under GAAP and
restrictions imposed after the date of this Agreement in connection with
future borrowings permitted under this Agreement.

  



  

5.25 _Books and Records_. The corporate record books (other than stock
ledgers and stock records) of FOBB and its Subsidiaries are complete and
accurate and reflect all meetings, consents and other actions of the boards
of directors and shareholders of FOBB and its Subsidiaries. The stock ledgers

(collectively, " _Intellectual Property_ ") which are material to the conduct
of the businesses of FOBB and its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens.
To the Knowledge of FOBB, none of the Intellectual Property of FOBB and its
Subsidiaries infringes on the rights of any other Person, and no Person is
infringing on the rights of FOBB or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
any Intellectual Property of FOBB or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Intellectual Property of FOBB and its Subsidiaries will not be limited or
otherwise adversely affected by virtue of the consummation of the
Transactions.

  



  

5.28 _Risk Management Instruments_. All material interest rate swaps, caps,
floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar
risk management arrangements, whether entered into for FOBBs own account, or
for the account of one or more of its Subsidiaries or their customers, were
entered into (a) in accordance with prudent business

  



        
   

  



  

practices and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
regulatory policies and (b) with counter parties believed to be financially
responsible at the time; and each of them constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of FOBB or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full force and
effect. Neither FOBB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of

as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian,
conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the
governing documents and applicable state and federal law and regulation and
common law. Neither FOBB, any FOBB Subsidiary, nor any director, officer, or
employee of FOBB or any of its Subsidiaries acting on behalf of FOBB or any
of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any
such fiduciary or agency account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary
or agency account are true and correct in all material respects
and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary or agency account. There
is no investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Authority pending, or to
the Knowledge of FOBB, threatened, against or affecting FOBB or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to the compliance by FOBB or any such Subsidiary
with sound fiduciary principles and applicable regulations.

  



  

5.30 _Internal Controls_. None of the FOBB or its Subsidiaries records,
systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained,
operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of FOBB
or its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting
controls described in the next sentence. FOBB and its Subsidiaries have
devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

5.31 _Takeover Laws_. FOBB has taken or will take all necessary actions so
that this Agreement and the Transactions are not subject to the requirements

entered into (a) in accordance with prudent business practices and in
compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies and (b) with counter parties believed to be financially responsible
at the time; and each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of MBFI or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with

to consummate any of the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither Party
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Person in possession or control of such information or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or in the ordinary
course of business.

  



        
   

  



  

7.6 _Alternative Proposal_. FOBB agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and its Representatives and affiliates not to, (a)
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or
proposals with respect to, any Alternative Proposal or (b) engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any nonpublic information to, or have any
discussions with, any Person relating to, any Alternative Proposal; provided
that, in the event FOBB receives an unsolicited written bona fide Alternative
Proposal and the FOBB Board concludes in good faith that such Alternative
Proposal constitutes or may result in a Superior Proposal, FOBB may, and may
permit its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, take any action
described in clause (b) above to the extent that the FOBB Board determines in
good faith (after the receipt of advice from its outside counsel) that
failure to take such actions may result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Delaware law. Prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to this Section, FOBB shall
have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms
substantially identical in all material respects to the confidentiality
agreement previously entered into by the Parties. FOBB will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than MBFI
with respect to any Alternative Proposal and will use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an
Alternative Proposal. FOBB will promptly (within one business day) advise
MBFI following receipt of any Alternative Proposal of all of the material
terms thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Alternative
Proposal), and will keep MBFI apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the
Alternative Proposal) on a substantially current basis.

(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, FOBB shall identify to MBFI
all Persons who, to FOBBs Knowledge, may be deemed at the date hereof (or at
another reasonably proximate date) "affiliates" of FOBB, as that term is used
in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (" _Rule
145 Affiliates_"). FOBB shall use all reasonable best efforts to obtain a
written agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C from each Person who
is so identified as a possible Rule 145 Affiliate and shall deliver copies of
such written agreements to MBFI as soon as practicable.

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable after the date of the FOBB Meeting, FOBB shall

time of the FOBB Meeting, Rule 145 Affiliates of FOBB and who were not
previously identified in accordance with Section 7.7(a). FOBB shall use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain a written agreement in the form specified
in Section 7.7(a) from each Person who is so identified and shall deliver

Nasdaq rules, whichever is applicable, and then only after making reasonable
efforts to first consult with the other Party.

  



        
   

  



  

7.9 _Takeover Laws_. No Party shall take any action that would cause any of
the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law
and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt

challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as
now or hereafter in effect.

with respect to conforming the loan and accounting policies and practices of
FOBB and its Subsidiaries to those policies and practices of MBFI and
its Subsidiaries for financial accounting and/or income Tax reporting
purposes, as reasonably specified in each case in writing from MBFI to FOBB,
based upon such consultation and subject to the conditions in Section

take any such action that is not permitted under GAAP or the Code or
regulatory guidance, whichever is applicable.

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable law, FOBB shall consult and reasonably cooperate
with MBFI with respect to determining, as reasonably specified in a written
notice from MBFI to FOBB, based upon such consultation and subject to the

financial accounting and/or income Tax reporting purposes of FOBBs and OB

that on the date such entries are made and such charges and expenses are
recognized, MBFI shall certify in writing to FOBB that (i) all conditions to
MBFIs obligations to consummate the Transactions as set forth in Sections
8.1 and 8.3 hereof (subject to the receipt of FOBBs officer certificate
pursuant to Section 8.3(f)) have been satisfied or waived, (ii) it is not
aware of any fact or circumstance that would delay or prevent the completion
of the Transactions, and (iii) it proposes the Effective Date to be within

provision of this Section 7.10, FOBB and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to take any action pursuant to this Section 7.10 that is not
permitted under applicable law (including the Code), regulations, GAAP or
regulatory guidance, whichever is applicable. In no event shall FOBB
be required to take any actions pursuant to this Section 7.10(c) until all
of the conditions to its obligations in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 shall have
been satisfied.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) No conforming entries or accruals or charges or expenses recognized at
the written request of MBFI in accordance with this Section 7.10 may be a
basis to assert a violation or a breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant of FOBB herein.

  



  

7.11 _Systems Integration_. Subject to Section 7.5(b) and (c) hereof, from
and after the date hereof, FOBB and MBFI shall cause OB Bank and MB Bank and
their respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall make all
reasonable efforts (without undue disruption to either business) to cause OB
Banks data processing consultants and software providers and MB Banks data
processing service providers to, reasonably cooperate and assist OB Bank or
MB Bank in connection with an electronic and systematic conversion of all
applicable data of OB Bank or MB Bank, as applicable, to the system selected

shares of MBFI Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

  



  

7.13 _Regulatory Applications_.

  



  

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare all documentation, to effect all
filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
Transactions and the change in ownership of the FOBB Subsidiaries, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to file within 30 days of the date hereof, the
applications necessary to obtain the permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Regulatory Authorities necessary to consummate the
Transactions. Each Party shall have the right to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable each will consult with the other Party, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and the change
in ownership of the FOBB Subsidiaries. In exercising the foregoing right, each
Party agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party
agrees that it will consult with the other Party with respect to the
obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the Transactions and the change in ownership of the FOBB
Subsidiaries, and each Party will keep the other Party apprised of the status
of material matters relating to completion of the Transactions and the change
in ownership of the FOBB Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or
Governmental Authority.

(c) During the period from the date hereof to the Effective Date, MBFI shall,

7.15 _Officers  and Directors Insurance; Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For six years from and after the Effective Date, MBFI shall maintain
officers and directors liability insurance covering the Persons who are
presently covered by FOBBs current officers and directors liability
insurance policy with respect to actions, omissions, events, matters or
circumstances occurring prior to the Effective Time, on terms which are at
least as favorable as the terms of said current policy, provided that it
shall not be required to expend in the aggregate during the coverage period
more than an amount equal to 250% of the annual premium most recently paid by
FOBB (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage
pursuant hereto, and further provided that if MBFI is unable to maintain or
obtain the insurance called for by this Section 7.15(a), MBFI shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available for the Insurance Amount which may be in the form of tail coverage,
or may request FOBB to obtain such tail coverage at FOBBs expense prior to
the Effective Date; provided, further, that officers and directors of FOBB or
its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to MBFIs insurance carrier for the purpose of
obtaining such insurance.

  



  

(b) In addition to Section 7.15(a) above, from and after the Effective Date,
MBFI shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain and preserve the
rights to indemnification of FOBBs and its Subsidiaries officers,
employees, directors and agents to the maximum extent permitted by any of the
FOBB Certificate, FOBB By-Laws and the charter and bylaws of OB Bank and
applicable law as in effect on the date hereof with respect to
indemnification for liabilities and claims arising out of claims, actions,
suits, proceedings or investigations (each, a " _Claim_ ") made, asserted or
arising prior to or within six years after the Effective Time, if such Claim
pertains to any acts, omissions, events, matters or circumstances occurring
or existing at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Transactions and
the matters referred to in Section 7.15(b) of FOBBs written disclosure
schedule, to the extent such rights to indemnification are not in excess of
that permitted by applicable state or federal laws or Regulatory Authorities.

  



  

(c) In connection with the indemnification provided pursuant to Section
7.15(b), MBFI and/or an MBFI Subsidiary (i) will advance expenses, promptly
after statements therefor are received, to each such indemnified Person to
the fullest extent permitted by law and Regulatory Authorities, including the
payment of the fees and expenses of one counsel with respect to a matter, and
one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction, if necessary or
appropriate, selected by such indemnified Person or multiple indemnified
Persons, it being understood that they collectively shall only be entitled to
one counsel and one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction where
necessary or appropriate (unless a conflict shall exist between them in which
case they may retain separate counsel), all such counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to MBFI and (ii) will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter.

  



  

(d) This Section 7.15 shall survive the Effective Time, is intended to
benefit each indemnified Person (each of whom shall be entitled to enforce
this Section against MBFI), and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of MBFI.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) In the event MBFI or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to one or
more other Persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of MBFI assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.15.

  



  

(f) MBFI shall pay all expenses (including attorneys fees) that may be
reasonably incurred by any indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this Section 7.15 if the indemnified Person
is successful in whole or any material part or if any dispute relating
thereto is settled or compromised.

  



  

7.16 _Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
MBFI or one of its Subsidiaries shall be substituted for FOBB or a FOBB
Subsidiary under the FOBB Employee Plans as Previously Disclosed and in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and MBFI or one of its
Subsidiaries shall assume and be vested with all of the powers, rights,
duties, obligations and liabilities previously vested in FOBB or the
applicable FOBB Subsidiary with respect to each such FOBB Employee Plan.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each such FOBB Employee Plan
shall, to the extent permitted thereunder and by applicable law, be continued
in effect by MBFI or an applicable MBFI Subsidiary after the Effective Time
without a termination or discontinuance thereof as a result of the
Transactions, subject to the power reserved to MBFI and each of its
Subsidiaries to subsequently amend or terminate any such FOBB Employee Plan,
which amendment or termination shall comply with applicable law.

  



  

(b) FOBB has taken all necessary action relating to the FOBB Employee Stock
Purchase Plan to cause the date hereof to be a purchase date under the Plan
and as a result thereof will cause 3,766 shares of FOBB Common Stock to be
issued to Plan participants. On and after the date hereof, no contributions
will be made to or accepted by the FOBB Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
other than as described in the preceding sentence, no shares of FOBB Common
Stock will be issued under the FOBB Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as
practicable after the date hereof, any payroll withholding amounts credited
to the account of an eligible employee under the FOBB Employee Stock Purchase
Plan which has not been applied to purchase FOBB Common Stock as provided
above shall be returned to such eligible employee in cash. FOBB shall cause
the FOBB Employee Stock Purchase Plan to be terminated immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) FOBB has taken all necessary action to amend the FOBB Director Stock Plan
as of the date hereof such that no director fees payable after the date
hereof shall be paid or payable for FOBB Common Stock or result in additional
DSUs under the Plan. Fees payable after the date hereof the receipt of which
would otherwise have been deferred shall continue to be deferred, with such
deferred fees, together with earnings credited at the same hypothetical
investment return applicable to amounts deferred under the FOBB Executive
DCP, payable at the time DSUs held under the Plan are payable. FOBB shall
cause the FOBB Director Stock Plan to be terminated immediately prior to the
Effective Time and any DSUs outstanding thereunder shall be paid as
contemplated by Section 7.18.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) MBFI shall provide, or cause an MBFI Subsidiary to provide, to each
continuing full time employee of FOBB and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (the
" _Continuing Employees_ ") the opportunity to participate without a waiting
period (except in the case of a qualified plan, participation shall commence
on the next entry date) in each employee benefit and welfare plan maintained
by MBFI or an MBFI Subsidiary, whichever is applicable, which is generally
available to its similarly-situated employees on a uniform and non-
discriminatory basis, provided that with respect to such plans maintained by
MBFI or an MBFI Subsidiary, whichever is applicable, Continuing Employees
shall be given credit for their past service with FOBB or a FOBB Subsidiary
in determining eligibility for participation and vesting in
benefits thereunder, and only with respect to severance and vacation plans,
accrual of benefits. Continuing Employees shall not be subject to any waiting
periods under the group health plan of MBFI or any applicable MBFI Subsidiary
to the extent that such periods are longer than the periods imposed under
the applicable FOBB group health plan and MBFI shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause its health insurance carrier to cover pre-existing
conditions that were previously covered for a Continuing Employee under the
FOBB health plan. To the extent that the initial period of coverage for
Continuing Employees under any plan of MBFI or a MBFI Subsidiary, whichever
is applicable, that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA is not a full 12-month period of coverage, Continuing
Employees shall be given credit under the applicable welfare plan for any
deductibles and co-insurance payments made by such Continuing Employees under
the corresponding FOBB welfare plan during the balance of such
12-month period of coverage. Nothing contained herein shall obligate MBFI or
any MBFI Subsidiary to provide or cause to be provided any benefits
duplicative to those provided under any benefit or welfare plan continued
pursuant to Section 7.16(a), including extending participation in any plan
which (i) is a qualified plan relative to any period of time with respect to
which allocations are made to Continuing Employees under any qualified plan
maintained or sponsored by FOBB or a FOBB Subsidiary that is continued by
MBFI or an MBFI Subsidiary for the benefit of Continuing Employees or (ii) is
an employee welfare benefit plan relative to any period of time that the FOBB
group health plan is continued by MBFI or an MBFI Subsidiary for the benefit
of Continuing Employees. MBFI agrees to continue the qualified plans of FOBB
and the group health plan of FOBB (to the extent permitted by the insurance
carrier) through calendar year 2006 for the benefit of Continuing Employees.
Nothing herein shall alter the power of MBFI or any MBFI Subsidiary to amend
or terminate any benefit or welfare plans of MBFI, FOBB or their
respective Subsidiaries. Moreover, this subsection 7.16(d) shall not confer
upon any Continuing Employee any rights or remedies hereunder and shall not
constitute a contract of employment or create any rights, to be retained or
otherwise, in employment at MBFI or any MBFI Subsidiary.

  



  

(e) Until the Effective Time, FOBB or a FOBB Subsidiary, whichever is
applicable, shall be liable for all obligations for continued health coverage
pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 through 609 of ERISA ("
_COBRA_ ") and 215 ILCS 5/367.2 with respect to qualified beneficiaries of
FOBB or a FOBB Subsidiary, whichever is applicable, who incur a qualifying
event before the Effective Time. MBFI or an MBFI Subsidiary, whichever is
applicable, shall be liable for (i) all obligations for continued health
coverage under COBRA and 215 ILCS 5/367.2 with respect to each qualified
beneficiary of FOBB or a FOBB Subsidiary who incurs a termination on and
after the Effective Time, and (ii) for continued health coverage under COBRA
and 215 ILCS 5/367.2 from and after the

  



        
   

  



  

Effective Time for each qualified beneficiary of FOBB or a FOBB Subsidiary
who incurs a qualifying event before the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) Neither Party shall take or refrain from taking any action or be required
to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to any FOBB Employee
Benefit Plan that would subject any participant thereunder to additional tax
and interest under Code Section 409A. To the extent any of FOBB Employee
Benefit Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, FOBB shall cause such
Plan to be amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code not later than
July 31, 2006.

  



  

(g) MBFI shall honor or cause its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with
their terms all FOBB Employee Benefit Plans including the FOBB Transitional
Severance Plan adopted on the date hereof and the FOBB Executive DCP, in each
case as Previously Disclosed.

  



  

(h) Prior to or concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, MBFI and
the FOBB CEO shall enter into a letter of understanding addressing certain
matters pertaining to the cancellation of the CEO Employment Agreement at the
Effective Time and the FOBB CEO entering into a new Employment Agreement with
MBFI immediately after the Effective Time, and MBFI shall enter into a letter
of understanding for the benefit of the FOBB Chief Financial Officer relating
to employment matters post-closing.

  



  

(i) Prior to the Effective Date, FOBB shall determine and award bonuses (the
" _Pro Rata Bonus_ ") with respect to that portion of calendar year 2006
ending on the last day of the calendar month preceding the Effective Date,
the amounts and recipients of which shall be determined consistent with past
practice. The amount of the Pro Rata Bonus has been and shall continue to be
accrued monthly based upon anticipated performance. The aggregate amount of
the Pro Rata Bonuses as awarded shall not exceed the corresponding pro rata
portion of the annual bonus pool as Previously Disclosed. The actual amount
of the Pro Rata Bonus shall be fully accrued as of the last day of the
calendar month next preceding the Effective Date. In January 2007, MBFI shall
determine and award bonuses (the " _Stub Period Bonus_ ") with respect to
portion of calendar year 2006 falling thereafter, the recipients and amounts
of which shall be determined in a manner consistent with the determination
and award of the Pro Rata Bonus, it being intended that the aggregate of the
Pro Rata Bonus and Stub Period Bonus will reflect a full year bonus. Subject
to the following sentence, the Pro Rata Bonus and Stub Period Bonus shall be
paid no later than the regular payroll date next following January 31, 2007
to those employees who are then employed by MBFI or one of its Subsidiaries.
For those employees whose employment terminated on or after the Effective
Date but prior to such payment date for any reason other than termination by
MBFI or one of its Subsidiaries for cause or voluntary resignation by the
employee, they shall be entitled to the portion of the 2006 through the month
end prior to their employment termination.

  



  

7.17 _FOBB Stock Options_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of a FOBB Stock Option, each FOBB Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into and become an option to purchase MBFI Common Stock (each an "
_Assumed Option_ ") on the same terms and

  



        
   

  



  

conditions as are in effect with respect to the FOBB Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (a) each such Assumed Option may be
exercised solely for shares of MBFI Common Stock, (b) the number of shares of
MBFI Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option will be equal to the number
of shares of FOBB Common Stock subject to such FOBB Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, the product
being rounded, if necessary, up or down to the nearest whole share, and (c)
the per share exercise price under each such Assumed Option will be adjusted
by dividing the per share exercise price of the FOBB Stock Option by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding up or down to the nearest cent. It is intended
that the foregoing assumption shall be undertaken consistent with and in a
manner that will not constitute a "modification" under Code Section 409A. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, MBFI shall file an
appropriate registration statement with respect to the shares of MBFI Common
Stock subject to Assumed Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

  



  

(b) Not later than ten days prior to the anticipated Effective Date, FOBB
shall be entitled to make a written offer to the holders of vested FOBB Stock
Options permitting such holders to irrevocably elect to have all or a
designated number of their FOBB Stock Options cancelled at the Effective Time
for a per share cancellation price equal to the Per Share Amount less the
exercise price per share, which per share cancellation price shall be paid in
shares of MBFI Common Stock having a value (based on the Final MBFI Share
Value) equal to aggregate per share cancellation price payable for such
cancelled FOBB Stock Options; provided that MBFI shall withhold shares having
a value equal to any applicable tax withholding amount. In order to
be binding, the written irrevocable election of an optionholder must be
received by FOBB not later than the 2nd day prior to the anticipated
Effective Date. Each written offer notice to be issued by FOBB and the
written election document to be delivered by optionholders shall be in form
and substance satisfactory to MBFI.

  



  

7.18 _DSUs and RSUs_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of DSUs and RSUs, the DSUs and
RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
MBFI in accordance with terms of the agreements and plans applicable thereto
as Previously Disclosed, except that the number DSUs and RSUs of each holder
shall be converted to a number of DSUs or RSUs, as applicable, equal to the
number of DSUs or RSUs, as applicable, held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. At and after the
Effective Time, each outstanding DSU and RSU shall represent the right to
receive a share of MBFI Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
agreements and plans applicable thereto as Previously Disclosed.  Upon the
conversion of the DSUs or RSUs of a holder to MBFI Common Stock, cash shall
be paid in lieu of any fractional share interest of such holder.

  



  

7.19 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of FOBB and MBFI shall give
prompt written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known
to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it, or (b) has caused or constituted or is
reasonably likely to cause or constitute, a material breach of (i) any of its
representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) any
of its covenants or agreements contained

  



        
   

  



  

herein; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement; and provided further that a failure to comply
with this Section 7.20 shall not constitute a failure to satisfy any
condition set forth in Article VIII unless the underlying
untruth, inaccuracy, failure to comply or satisfy, or change or event
would independently result in a failure to satisfy a condition set forth in
Article VIII.

  



  

7.20 _Litigation Matters_. FOBB will consult with MBFI about any proposed
settlement, or any disposition of, any material litigation affecting FOBB or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

7.21 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. MBFI and FOBB agree that, in order to
most effectively compensate and retain Rule 16(b) Insiders (as
defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that Rule 16(b) Insiders not be subject to
a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of FOBB Common Stock, FOBB Stock Options, DSUs and RSUs into shares
of MBFI Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 7.21. Assuming that
FOBB delivers to MBFI the FOBB Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a
timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, the MBFI Board, or a committee of
non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in
any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing in
substance that the receipt by the Rule 16(b) Insiders of MBFI Common Stock in
exchange for shares of FOBB Common Stock, and of Assumed Options upon
conversion of FOBB Stock Options, and assumed DSUs and RSUs upon conversion
of the DSUs and RSUs of FOBB, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the FOBB
Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.  "FOBB Section 16 Information" shall mean information
accurate in all material respects regarding the Rule 16(b) Insiders, the
number of shares of FOBB Common Stock held by each such Rule 16(b)
Insider and expected to be exchanged for MBFI Common Stock in the Merger, and
the number and description of the options to purchase shares of FOBB Common
Stock, and DSUs and RSUs held by each such MBFI Insider and expected to be
converted into options to purchase shares or shares, as the case may be, of
MBFI Common Stock in connection with the Merger; provided that the
requirement for a description of any FOBB options shall be deemed to be
satisfied if copies of all plans, and forms of agreements, under which such
options have been granted have been made available to MBFI. "Rule 16(b)
Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of FOBB who are subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are
listed in the FOBB Section 16 Information.

  



  

7.22 _Reservation of Shares; Dividend_. MBFI shall reserve for issuance such
number of shares of MBFI Common Stock as is necessary to satisfy its
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

7.23 _Expansion of MBFI Board and MB Bank Board_. At the Effective Time, the
FOBB CEO and Charles Gries shall be added as directors to the MBFI Board and
the FOBB CEO and John Ballantine shall be added as directors to the board of
directors of MB Bank at the effective time of the Bank Merger.

  



        
   

  



  

7.24 _Best Practices, etc_. It is the intention MBFI to use, chose or
retain, as applicable, the best practices, best systems, and best personnel
of MB Bank and OB Bank, as applicable, after the Bank Merger.

the Regulatory Authority which must grant such approval, provided, however,

Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable
order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the any of the
Transactions;

  



  

(d) by either MBFI or FOBB in writing if the shareholders of FOBB do not

(e) by MBFI in writing within five business days after delivery of the
