privileges expressly conveyed to the Acquired Companies pursuant to this

Acquired Companies the Assumed Liabilities expressly assumed by the Acquired
Companies pursuant to this Agreement, and to otherwise effectuate the
Transactions and promptly upon discovery of any asset, property, right or
Liability not contemplated by this Agreement to be a Transferred Asset or an
Assumed Liability, respectively, notify the Sellers or the Buyer, as
applicable, of any such asset, property, right or Liability in the Sellers',
the Buyer's or any of their respective controlled Affiliates' possession or
control and (i) transfer and/or deliver back to the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries such asset, property, right or Liability, which asset, property,
right or Liability was transferred and/or delivered to the Acquired Companies
and/or (ii) transfer and/or deliver to the Acquired Companies any asset,
property, right or Liability contemplated by this Agreement to be a
Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability, as applicable, which was not
transferred and/or delivered to the Acquired Companies at the Closing.

  

  

(c) Without limitation of the foregoing Section 1.3(b), in the event that
after the date hereof and within twelve (12) months after the Closing, (i)
either the Buyer or the Sellers discover any material asset, property or right
held by the Sellers or the Acquired Companies, respectively, which was not
designated a Transferred Asset and was not described in any of Sections 1.1
through 1.2 or elsewhere in any Transaction Agreement or was not otherwise an
asset of any Acquired Company used in the Business, and (ii) in the case of
the Buyer, the non-transfer of such asset, property or right from the relevant
Seller causes a breach of the representation contained in Section 4.18, and in
the case of the Sellers, the transfer or non-transfer of such asset, property
or right causes Sellers to be deprived of a material asset, property or right
necessary for the operation of the Seller Business, then (A) if such asset,
property or right exclusively relates to the Business (in the case of the
Buyer) or exclusively relates to the Seller Business (in the case of the
Sellers), the Parties shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to effect
the transfer of such asset, property or right to the appropriate Party as if
such asset, property or right was a Transferred Asset or a Retained Asset, as
applicable, for no additional consideration, and (B) in all other cases, the
Parties shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Business
or the Seller Business, as applicable, the benefit of such asset, property or
right, either pursuant to the Master Services Agreement or pursuant to other
mutually agreed

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-9-  

  

 

  upon and commercially reasonable arrangements. Upon a transfer to the
relevant Party of such asset, property or right pursuant to clause (A), the
transferred asset, property or right shall be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement to be a Transferred Asset or a Retained Asset, as applicable, as if
it had been identified prior to Closing (including the provisions of Section
1.4 to the extent that such asset, property or right may constitute a Non-
Assignable Asset), and the transferee of such asset, property or right shall
assume any corresponding Liability associated with such asset, property or
right to the extent such assumption is otherwise consistent with the terms of
this Agreement in terms of the types of Liabilities assumed or not assumed
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In the event that the Parties cannot
initially agree on whether a particular asset should or should not be a
Transferred Asset or a Retained Asset or is otherwise subject to this Section
1.3(c), or as to actions required or appropriate to be taken under this
Section 1.3(c), designated executive officers of each of US Seller and the
Buyer will discuss the matter in good faith for at least a period of thirty
(30) calendar days in an effort to seek a resolution that is commercially
reasonable, practical (e.g., given the possible need for a third party's
consent on a third party contract) and consistent with this Agreement, prior
to the initiation of any Action seeking any relief whatsoever arising out of,
or in connection with, this Agreement (other than remedies under Article 12).

 

  

  

(d) All tangible Transferred Assets (including all tangible embodiments of
intangible Transferred Assets) will be delivered to the Acquired Companies FOB
at the location of the US Seller and its Subsidiaries or the Acquired
Companies, as applicable, at which such assets are located in the ordinary
course of the operation of the Business and the Seller Business at the time of
the consummation of the Contribution. Risk of loss with respect to the
Transferred Assets shall pass to the Acquired Companies effective as of the
consummation of the Contribution.

  

  

(e) All Transferred Assets that can be delivered by electronic transmission
using commercially reasonable efforts shall be so delivered or made available
to the Acquired Companies or the US Seller, as applicable, at a designated
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site.

  

  

(f) From and after the Closing, the Parties will provide reasonable
cooperation to each other Party in assisting in the assertion or enforcement
of any claims, causes of action and rights of recovery contemplated by
Sections 1.1(a)(i)(J), 1.1(a)(ii)(J), 1.2(a)(i)(J) and 1.2(a)(ii)(J) of this
Agreement, in each case at the sole expense of the Party asserting or
enforcing such claims, causes of action and rights of recovery.

  

  

1.4 Non-Assignable Transferred Assets.

  

  

(a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to
contribute, transfer, assign, convey or deliver any asset, property or right
to the Acquired Companies (provided, that this Section 1.4(a) shall not affect
whether any asset, property or right shall be deemed to be a Transferred Asset
for any other purpose under this Agreement and, to the extent not listed on
Section 4.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, shall not affect any of the
representations and/or warranties made by any Seller in any Transaction
Agreement) that by its terms or by Law (x) is not transferable or non-
assignable, as applicable, without the consent or waiver of a third Person or
(y) is cancelable by a third Person in the event of such a transfer or
assignment without the consent or waiver of such third Person (collectively,
"Non-Assignable Assets"),

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-10-  

  

 

  in each case unless and until such consent or waiver shall have been
obtained. The Buyer and the Sellers shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents or waivers required as a result of
the Transactions; provided, however, that, in connection with the foregoing
neither Party shall be required to (i) pay or agree to pay any unreasonable
amounts or other consideration, (ii) agree to the imposition of any limitation
or obligation on its business or operations, (iii) provide or agree to provide
any additional security (including a guaranty), or (iv) agree to any
unreasonable modifications of existing contracts or the entry into any new
contracts; and provided, further, that if any such consent or waiver that is
not required to be obtained as a condition to the Buyer's obligation to
consummate the Transactions pursuant to Article 3 is not obtained prior to the
Closing, the Closing shall nonetheless take place.

 

  

  

(b) The Buyer and the Sellers shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to) use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval,
administrative decision, or amendment required to novate all Assumed
Liabilities or to obtain in writing the release of the Buyer or the US Seller
(or their respective Subsidiaries), as applicable, so that, in any such case,
the UK Acquired Company shall be solely responsible for the UK Seller ITO
Liabilities, and the PL Acquired Company shall be solely responsible for the
PL Seller ITO Liabilities, effective as of the consummation of the
Contribution.

  

  

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event that required
consents or waivers cannot be obtained prior to the Closing, such Non-
Assignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by the
applicable Seller, in trust for the applicable Acquired Company and its
successors, and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be performed by
the applicable Acquired Companies in each other's name and all benefits and
obligations existing thereunder shall be for the account of the Party for whom
such Non-Assignable Assets are held in trust. The applicable Seller shall take
or cause to be taken, at the expense of the Party for whom a Non-Assignable
Asset is held in trust, such actions in their name or otherwise as the
applicable Acquired Companies may reasonably request so as to provide the
applicable Acquired Companies with the benefits of such Non-Assignable Asset
(including pursuant to the Master Services Agreement or other mutually agreed
upon and commercially reasonable arrangements) and to effect the collection of
money, other consideration or other benefits that become due and payable under
such Non-Assignable Asset, and the applicable Seller shall promptly pay over
to the Acquired Company, as applicable, all money, other consideration or
other benefits received in respect of such Non-Assignable Assets. Any Non-
Assignable Assets described in this Section 1.4 shall be treated as owned by
the applicable Acquired Company for income Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

  

  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, the UK Seller on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries authorizes the UK Acquired Company, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Assets that constitute UK
Seller ITO Assets, at the Buyer's expense, to perform all the obligations and
receive all the benefits of the UK Seller or its Subsidiaries under the Non-
Assignable Assets that constitute UK Seller ITO Assets, and appoints the UK
Acquired Company as its attorney-in-fact to act in its name and on its behalf
with respect thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-11-  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) From and after the Closing Date, each of the PL Sellers on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries shall authorize a person designated by the PL
Acquired Company, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the Non-Assignable Assets that constitute PL Seller ITO Assets, at the Buyer's
expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the benefits of the PL
Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries under the Non-Assignable Assets that
constitute PL Seller ITO Assets, and appoints the PL Acquired Company as its
attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its behalf with respect thereto and
obliges itself to issue or to cause to be issued by its Subsidiaries, upon
request, any powers of attorney that could be required for the purpose of the
proper and undisturbed performance of this Section 1.4(e).

  

  

(f) Upon obtaining the requisite third Person consents or waivers thereto,
such Non-Assignable Asset shall be transferred and assigned to the Acquired
Companies, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(g) The Acquired Companies in their capacity as intended transferees of a Non-
Assignable Asset (the "Intended Transferees") shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers, in their capacity as the intended transferors of such
Non-Assignable Asset (the "Intended Transferors"), from and against any and
all Losses actually incurred by the Intended Transferors or their Affiliates
as a result of the failure on the part of the Intended Transferees or their
Affiliates after the Closing Date to perform any covenant or obligation that
such Intended Transferee shall have expressly agreed in writing to perform
with respect to such Non-Assignable Asset.

  

  

(h) Each Seller and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to separate or duplicate the agreements listed on Schedule 1.4(h) (the "1.4(h)
Contracts") so as to provide the Acquired Companies with standalone versions
of such agreements providing for the same services and terms as those
currently provided to Seller or its Affiliates under such agreements or
otherwise on terms that are reasonably acceptable to the Buyer; provided,
however, that, in connection with the foregoing no Seller nor its Affiliates
shall be required to (i) pay or agree to pay any unreasonable amounts or other
unreasonable consideration, (ii) agree to the imposition of any limitation or
obligation on its business or operations (except as otherwise agreed in any
Transaction Agreement), (iii) provide or agree to provide any additional
security (including a guaranty), or (iv) agree to any unreasonable
modifications of existing contracts or the entry into any new contracts on
terms that are not the same or materially similar to the agreement being
separated or duplicated. From and after the Closing until such 1.4(h) Contract
has been separated or duplicated as provided for in this Section 1.4(h) or has
terminated or expired, each Acquired Company shall be entitled to receive, and
the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each
Acquired Company does receive, the benefits such Acquired Company received
(directly or indirectly) under such 1.4(h) Contract in the ordinary course or
business prior to the Closing and such Acquired Company shall reimburse the
applicable Seller for any payments owed by such Seller to the other parties to
such 1.4(h) Contract in connection with such Acquired Company's receipt of
such benefits.

ARTICLE 2

  

THE STOCK PURCHASE

  

  

2.1 Purchase and Sale of the Acquired Stock.

  

  

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing and at the Relevant Time, the Buyer shall purchase (or cause one
or more of its Subsidiaries to purchase), and the US Seller, UK Seller and PL
Sellers shall sell, free and clear of all Liens, all of the Acquired Stock in
exchange for (i) an aggregate cash payment of One Hundred and Forty Million
Dollars ($140,000,000) (the "Unadjusted Closing Purchase Price"), as adjusted
pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.1, payable in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the issuance by Buyer's parent entity of the
limited liability company interests as described in Schedule 2.1(a).
Consequently, at the Closing and at the Relevant Time, the PL Seller 1 and PL
Seller 2 sell and the Buyer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries) purchases all
PL Acquired Company Stock, whereas the sale and purchase shall ensue on the
basis of the PL Stock Purchase Agreement concluded in a written form with
signatures of parties representatives certified by a Polish notary public,
substantially in the form as attached to this Agreement as Exhibit H1, free
and clear of any Liens.

  

  

(b) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following capitalized
terms shall have the following respective meanings:

  

  

(i) "Adjusted Closing Purchase Price" shall mean the Unadjusted Closing
Purchase Price:

  

  

(A) minus the amount of Closing Indebtedness;

  

  

(B) plus (x) the amount, if any, by which Closing Net Working Capital is
greater than Target Net Working Capital, or minus (y) the amount, if any, by
which Closing Net Working Capital is less than Target Net Working Capital;

  

  

(C) minus the amount of the Closing Seller Transaction Expenses; and

  

  

(D) plus the Receivables Amount.

  

  

(ii) "Agreed Accounting Principles" shall mean GAAP, and insofar as they are
in accordance with GAAP, using the same accounting principles, practices,
procedures, policies and methods, and classifications, that were employed in
the preparation of the Balance Sheet.

  

  

(iii) "Closing Indebtedness" shall mean the outstanding Indebtedness of the
Acquired Companies, and any Indebtedness for which any Acquired Company is, or
may be, liable, in each case, as of the Relevant Time, including all
obligations described in clause (vi) and clause (viii) of the definition of
Indebtedness that would arise in connection with the unwinding or repayment,
as applicable, of such Indebtedness as of the Relevant Time (other than Buyer
Debt).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-13-  

  

 

 

 

  

(iv) "Closing Net Working Capital" shall mean Net Working Capital as of the
Relevant Time.

  

  

(v) "Closing Seller Transaction Expenses" shall mean the amount of the Seller
Transaction Expenses for which any Acquired Company is, or may be, liable, if
any.

  

  

(vi) "Current Assets" shall mean the total amount that would, in conformity
with the Agreed Accounting Principles, be included in "total current assets"
on a combined balance sheet of Acquired Companies; provided, however, that
Current Assets shall exclude (A) any current assets that are not Transferred
Assets, (B) cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, (C) all Tax
assets (whether current or deferred), (D) any assets related to Closing
Indebtedness or Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, (E) the Undiscounted
Receivables Amount, and (F) any assets related to intercompany balances
between the Sellers and any of their Affiliates.

  

  

(vii) "Current Liabilities" shall mean the total amount that would, in
conformity with the Agreed Accounting Principles, be included in "total
current liabilities" on a combined balance sheet of the Acquired Companies
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all accrued salary, wages,
bonuses, vacation and other employee benefits with respect to the Transferred
Employees); provided, however, that Current Liabilities shall exclude (A) any
current liabilities of the UK Acquired Company and/or PL Acquired Company that
are not Assumed Liabilities, (B) Closing Indebtedness or Closing Seller
Transaction Expenses, (C) all income Tax liabilities (whether current or
deferred) (D) the unfavorable lease liability related to the Downers Grove
facility, (E) any liabilities related to intercompany balances between the
Sellers and any of their Affiliates and (F) all deferred revenue relating to
the contract set forth on Schedule 2.1(b).

  

  

(viii) "Net Working Capital" shall mean (x) the Current Assets, minus (y) the
Current Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, and solely as an illustration
of the methodology set forth in the preceding sentences, Exhibit A sets forth
an illustrative calculation of Net Working Capital as of March 31, 2015.

  

  

(ix) "Receivables Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the unpaid portion, as

percent (15%) discount rate.

  

  

(x) "Target Net Working Capital" shall mean Twenty Eight Million Nine Hundred
and Eleven Thousand Dollars ($28,911,000).

  

  

(c) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the US

setting forth the US Seller's (i) good faith estimate of (1) the amount of
Closing Indebtedness, (2) the amount of Closing Net Working Capital and (3)
the amount of the Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, (ii) calculation of the
Receivables Amount and (iii) a calculation of the Adjusted Closing Purchase

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-14-  

  

 

  Price based on the foregoing amounts (the amount so calculated being
referred to herein as the "Estimated Adjusted Closing Purchase Price"). The
Pre-Closing Statement shall be subject to the approval of the Buyer prior to
Closing, which approval shall not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For
the avoidance of doubt, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net Working Capital
shall entirely disregard any and all effects on the assets and liabilities of
the Acquired Companies of (x) purchase accounting adjustments arising from or
resulting as a consequence of the consummation of the Transactions, (y) any
financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates and any additional letters of credit, security,
guarantees or other consideration provided by the Buyer (or any Acquired
Company with the Buyer's prior written consent) to obtain third party consents
or novations in connection with the Transactions (collectively, the "Buyer
Debt") (provided that this clause (y) shall not affect the calculation of
Closing Indebtedness as of the Relevant Time with respect to any Indebtedness
that is not Buyer Debt), or (z) any other transaction entered into by the
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates
following the Closing.

 

  

  

(d) On or prior to Closing, Buyer and US Seller shall agree upon an allocation
of the purchase price among the US Acquired Company Stock, the UK Acquired
Company Stock, and the PL Acquired Company Stock, which shall be in accordance
with Schedule 2.1(d) attached hereto (the "Entity Allocation"). All parties
hereto shall prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with, and shall not
take any tax position inconsistent with, such Entity Allocation. Within one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide US
Seller with an allocation among the assets of the UK Acquired Company and the
PL Acquired Company of the proceeds allocated to each such entity pursuant to
the Entity Allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, which US
Seller shall have the opportunity to review and comment on for a period of
fifteen (15) days, and Buyer will consider US Seller's reasonable comments in
good faith. In the event the purchase price is adjusted, any such adjustments
shall be allocated to US Acquired Company Stock.

  

  

(e) At the Closing, pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) and Section 3.2(e)(i), and
without duplication, the Buyer shall deliver to the US Seller, UK Seller and
PL Sellers, in accordance with the Entity Allocation, a cash payment in
immediately available funds in an aggregate amount equal to the Estimated
Adjusted Closing Purchase Price as set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement.

  

  

(f) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than one hundred twenty
(120) calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the US
Seller a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth the Buyer's
calculation of (i) the amount of Closing Indebtedness, (ii) the amount of
Closing Net Working Capital, (iii) the amount of the Closing Seller
Transaction Expenses, (iv) the Receivables Amount and (v) a calculation of the
Adjusted Closing Purchase Price based on the foregoing amounts, together with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation for such calculations. The Post-
Closing Statement shall be prepared using the Agreed Accounting Principles and
applicable definitions in this Agreement. The US Seller shall provide (and
shall cause the UK Seller and the PL Sellers to provide) the Buyer and its
Representatives with reasonable access (with the right to make copies), during
normal business hours, to the employees, properties, facilities, books and
records and other relevant documentation and information of the Sellers and
their Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent reasonably necessary to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-15-  

  

 

  enable the Buyer and its Representatives to prepare the Post-Closing
Statement. Any access to the properties of the Sellers or their Subsidiaries
shall be subject to the US Seller's reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements (including those set forth in the Master Services Agreement and
other mutually agreed upon and commercially reasonable arrangements) and shall
not include the right to perform invasive testing without the prior consent of
the US Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In the event that the Buyer does not deliver the Post-Closing
Statement to the US Seller within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after
the Closing Date (except as a result of the failure by the Sellers to provide
the access and information required by the immediately preceding sentence),
each item on the Pre-Closing Statement shall be deemed undisputed and the Pre-
Closing Statement (and all components thereof) shall be final and binding on
the Parties and not subject to appeal.

 

  

  

(g) After the Buyer's delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, the Buyer shall
provide the US Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access (with the
right to make copies), during normal business hours, to the work papers of the
Buyer, its accountants and other Representatives related to the preparation of
the Post-Closing Statement, as well as reasonable access to its employees,
properties, facilities, books and records and other relevant documentation and
information of the Acquired Companies, in each case, to the extent reasonably
necessary to enable US Seller and its Representatives to review the Post-
Closing Statement. The US Seller shall have thirty (30) days following its
receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (the "Review Period") to review the same
together with all documentation and information requested in accordance with
this Section 2.1(g) (which shall be promptly provided by the Buyer). On or
before the expiration of the Review Period, the US Seller shall deliver to the
Buyer a written statement accepting or disputing the Post-Closing Statement.
In the event that the US Seller shall dispute the Post-Closing Statement, such
statement shall include a detailed itemization of the US Seller's good faith
objections and the reasons therefor (such statement, a "Dispute Statement").
Any component of the Adjusted Closing Purchase Price contained in the Post-
Closing Statement that is not disputed in a Dispute Statement shall be final
and binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal. If the US Seller does
not deliver a Dispute Statement to the Buyer within the Review Period (except
as a result of the failure by Buyer to provide the access and information
required by the first sentence of this subsection) or delivers a statement
accepting the Post-Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statement (and all
components thereof) shall be final and binding on the Parties and not subject
to appeal.

  

  

(h) If the US Seller delivers a Dispute Statement during the Review Period,
the Buyer and the US Seller shall promptly attempt in good faith to resolve
their differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Statement during the thirty (30) calendar days immediately following the
Buyer's receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as the Buyer
and the US Seller may mutually agree (the "Resolution Period"). Any such
disputed items that are agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the US Seller
during the Resolution Period shall be final and binding on the Parties and not
subject to appeal. If the Buyer and the US Seller do not resolve all such
disputed items by the end of the Resolution Period, the Buyer and the US
Seller shall submit all items then remaining in dispute with respect to the
Dispute Statement to the dispute resolution group of a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm or financial consulting firm upon which the Buyer
and the US Seller shall reasonably agree (the "Accounting Firm") for review
and resolution. The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an
arbitrator. The

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-16-  

  

 

  Accounting Firm shall (i) make all determinations in accordance with the
Agreed Accounting Principles and applicable definitions in this Agreement,
(ii) shall determine only those items remaining in dispute between the Buyer
and the US Seller, and (iii) shall not be permitted or authorized to determine
an amount with respect to any such disputed item that is either greater than
or less than, as the case may be, the amount of such disputed item as proposed
by the Buyer in the Post-Closing Statement or the amount of such disputed item
as proposed by the US Seller in the Dispute Statement. Each of the Buyer and
the US Seller shall (A) enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm
and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (B) have the opportunity to
submit written statements and make oral presentations in support of their
respective positions with respect to such disputed items, to provide
supporting material to the Accounting Firm in defense of their respective
positions with respect to such disputed items and to submit a written
statement responding to the other party's position with respect to such
disputed items and (C) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity
agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their respective books,
records, personnel and Representatives and such other information as the
Accounting Firm may reasonably require in order to render its determination.
The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to the Buyer and the US
Seller a written determination (such determination to include a worksheet
setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination
and to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by the
Buyer and the US Seller) of the disputed items within thirty (30) calendar
days of receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Accounting Firm will be
allocated between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the US Seller, on the other
hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items
so submitted to the Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each
such Party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total
disputed amount of such items so submitted.

 

  

  

(i) The Adjusted Closing Purchase Price, as determined in accordance with the
final, binding and nonappealable resolution of the calculation of the amount
of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, the amount of
Closing Net Working Capital and the Receivables Amount pursuant to the terms
of Section 2.1(f), 2.1(g) and 2.1(h), as applicable, shall be referred to
herein as the "Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price;" provided, however, that
any additional consideration paid to the US Seller pursuant to Section 2.2
shall increase the Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price by the amount so
paid. Upon the determination of the Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price, the
Buyer, the US Seller, UK Seller or PL Sellers shall make (or cause to be made)
the following payment, as applicable:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-17-  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) If the Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price, without taking into account
any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2, is greater than the Estimated Adjusted
Closing Purchase Price, then within five (5) Business Days after such final
determination, the Buyer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the US
Seller, UK Seller or PL Sellers, as applicable, a cash amount equal to such
excess in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the US Seller. The portion of such excess
that is payable to the US Seller, UK Seller or PL Sellers, as applicable,
shall be determined in the US Seller's reasonable discretion (with the Buyer's
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) based on the
items of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Seller Transaction Expenses or Closing
Net Working Capital resulting in such excess.

  

  

(ii) If the Estimated Adjusted Closing Purchase Price, without taking into
account any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2, is greater than the Final
Adjusted Closing Purchase Price, then within five (5) Business Days after such
final determination, the US Seller, UK Seller and/or PL Sellers shall deliver
to the Buyer a cash amount equal to such excess in immediately available funds
by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Buyer.
The amount of such excess that is payable by the US Seller, UK Seller or PL
Sellers, as applicable, shall be determined in the US Seller's reasonable
discretion (with the Buyer's written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) based on the items of Closing Indebtedness or Closing Net Working
Capital resulting in such excess.

  

  

2.2 Earnout Obligation. Buyer agrees to pay or cause to be paid to the US
Seller, as additional consideration for the purchase of the US Acquired
Company Stock, the amount(s) determined pursuant to and as set forth in
Exhibit J.

  

  

2.3 Severance Expenses.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
(including any provision contained in Article VIII), but subject to the
limitations and procedures set forth in this Section 2.3, the Sellers shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify, defend, hold harmless and reimburse Buyer
for up to $1,250,000 of Severance Expenses (the "Severance Cap").

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the end of the Severance Period and in
any event no later than twenty (20) days thereafter (the "Severance Claim
Period"), the Buyer shall deliver to the US Seller a written statement (the
"Severance Statement") setting forth the Buyer's good faith calculation of the
total, aggregate amount of Severance Expenses (the "Severance Amount"),
together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation for such
calculation and any additional documentation and information reasonably
requested by the US Seller (which shall be promptly provided by the Buyer) and
specifying in reasonable detail (i) the individual items of Severance Expenses
included in the Severance Statement, (ii) the date each such item of Severance
Expenses was incurred or paid, and (iii) a brief description (to the extent
available to Buyer) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to each
item of Severance Expenses based on such Buyer's good faith belief thereof,
including the identity and address of any terminated Transferred Employee, UK
Transferred Employee or PL Transferred Employee for which Severance Expenses
are being claimed. For a period of thirty (30) days after Buyer provides the
Severance Statement to US Seller, US Seller shall have the opportunity to
review and comment on such Severance Statement, and the parties shall
cooperate in good faith for a period of ten (10) days thereafter to resolve
any differences they have with respect to the Severance Amount. If Buyer and
US Seller are unable to resolve such differences during such time, all items
then remaining in dispute with respect to the Severance Statement shall be
submitted to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution, pursuant to
procedures substantially similar to those set forth in Section 2.1(h). All
fees and expenses, if any, relating to the work to be performed by the
Accounting Firm will be shared substantially in accordance with Section
2.1(h). The Severance Statement shall be revised in accordance with all
resolutions conclusively agreed upon

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-18-  

  

 

  by Buyer and US Seller or, in the absence thereof, as resolved by the
Accounting Firm (such revised Severance Statement, the "Final Severance
Statement"). The Final Severance Statement shall be final and binding on the
Parties and not subject to appeal. The Severance Amount, as determined in
accordance with this Section 2.3(b), shall be referred to herein as the "Final
Severance Amount." Within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the
Final Severance Amount, the US Seller shall deliver (or cause to be delivered)
to the Buyer a cash amount equal to the lesser of the Final Severance Amount
and the Severance Cap in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account or accounts designated in writing by the Buyer.

 

  

  

2.4 Separation Costs.

  

  

(a) Subject to the occurrence of the Closing and to the terms and provisions
of this Section 2.4, the Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall be responsible
for the payment of up to $10,000,000 of Separation Costs in the aggregate (the
"Separation Cap") for Separation Costs incurred and/or paid by the Buyer, any
Acquired Company and/or any Seller (in any such case, whether before or after
the Closing). Schedule 2.4(a)(iii) sets forth the amount of Separation Costs
that the Sellers have incurred and/or paid on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and the Sellers shall update such schedule as of the Closing Date to
set forth the amount of Separation Costs that the Sellers have incurred and/or
paid on or prior to the Closing Date. For a period beginning on the Closing
Date and continuing until the earlier to occur of (i) two (2) years from the
Closing Date and (ii) the date on which the Buyer and/or the Acquired
Companies, on a collective basis, have incurred and/or paid Separation Costs
(whether to or on behalf of the Seller or otherwise) equal to the Separation
Cap, the Buyer and the Acquired Companies, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend, hold harmless and reimburse the Sellers for any Separation
Costs incurred and/or paid during such period or listed on Schedule
2.4(a)(iii) by any of the Sellers in an aggregate amount equal to the
Separation Cap minus the amount of Separation Costs incurred and/or paid by
the Buyer and/or any Acquired Company (on a collective basis) (whether to or
on behalf of the Seller or otherwise).

  

  

(b) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date (the "Separation
Claims Period"), the Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend,
hold harmless and reimburse the Buyer for any Separation Costs incurred and/or
paid by the Buyer and/or any Acquired Company, on a collective basis, in
excess of the Separation Cap during the Separation Claims Period, and once an
amount of Separation Costs incurred and/or paid by the Buyer and/or the
Acquired Companies, on a collective basis, equals the Separation Cap, the
Sellers shall, jointly and severally, pay any Separation Costs incurred by any
Seller during the Separation Claims Period.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, before any costs, fees or expenses that exceed $250,000 may be
considered Separation Costs, they must be approved by the Buyer and the US
Seller, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-19-  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) If a Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to indemnification or

Party") shall deliver to the Party from which it is seeking indemnification or
reimbursement (the "SC Indemnifying Party") a written statement (the
"Separation Statement") setting forth the SC Indemnified Party's good faith
calculation of the total, aggregate amount of Separation Costs incurred and/or
paid by or on behalf of such SC Indemnified Party as of such date (the
"Separation Amount"), together with reasonably detailed supporting
documentation for such calculation and any additional documentation and
information reasonably requested by the SC Indemnifying Party (which shall be
promptly provided by the SC Indemnified Party) and specifying in reasonable
detail (i) the individual items of Separation Costs included in the Separation
Statement, (ii) the date each such item of Separation Costs was paid, and
(iii) a brief description (to the extent available to the SC Indemnified
Party) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to each item of
Separation Costs based on such SC Indemnified Party's good faith belief
thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party payee. Such
Separation Statement must be delivered as promptly as practicable and in any
event no later than fifteen (15) days after the end of the calendar quarter in
which such Separation Costs are incurred; provided, however, that a Separation
Statement for Separation Costs incurred before Closing must be delivered as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than fifteen (15) days after
the end of the first calendar quarter following Closing; provided further,
however, that a Separation Statement may be submitted for any preceding
Separation Costs not previously claimed in a Separation Statement if delivered

For a period of thirty (30) days after the SC Indemnified Party provides the
Separation Statement to the SC Indemnifying Party, the SC Indemnifying Party
shall have the opportunity to review and comment on such Separation Statement,
and the parties shall cooperate in good faith for a period of ten (10) days
thereafter to resolve any differences they have with respect to such
Separation Amount. If such Parties are unable to resolve such differences
during such time, all items then remaining in dispute with respect to such
Separation Statement shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for review and
resolution, pursuant to procedures substantially similar to those set forth in
Section 2.1(h). If more than one Party shall submit a Separation Statement
with respect to which a Final Separation Statement (as defined below) has not
been issued, then the Accounting Firm shall consider those Separation
Statements together (the "Combined Separation Statements"). All fees and
expenses, if any, relating to the work to be performed by the Accounting Firm
will be shared substantially in accordance with Section 2.1(h). The Separation
Statement, or if applicable, Combined Separation Statements, shall be revised
in accordance with all resolutions conclusively agreed upon by the SC
Indemnified Party and the SC Indemnifying Party or, in the absence thereof, as
resolved by the Accounting Firm (such revised Separation Statement or if
applicable, Combined Separation Statements, collectively, the "Final
Separation Statement"). The Final Separation Statement shall be final and
binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal. The Separation Amount, as
determined in accordance with this Section 2.4(d), including, but not limited
to, any offset or netting with respect to any Combined Separation Statements,
shall be referred to herein as the "Final Net Separation Amount." Upon the
determination of the Final Net Separation Amount, then within five (5)
Business Days after such final determination, the Party obligated to indemnify
or reimburse another Party pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall deliver (or
cause to be delivered) to such Party entitled to indemnification or
reimbursement a cash amount equal to such Final Net Separation Amount in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account or accounts
designated in writing by such Party entitled to indemnification or

-40-  

  

 

  been administered and operated in material compliance with, its terms and
all applicable Laws, orders, rules and regulations. Section 4.13(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of each
Company Employee Plan and each Seller Employee Plan and separately designates
each such Company Employee Plan or Seller Employee Plan with respect to which
the Buyer or the US Acquired Company could reasonably be expected to have any
Liability following the Closing. Each Company Employee Plan and Seller
Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code is so qualified and has received a current favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service, and nothing has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such plan. The
Sellers, the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates have complied and are in
compliance with the applicable requirements of COBRA.

has any Liability under or with respect to, any "employee benefit plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is or was subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or any
"multiemployer plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), nor
have any of the Acquired Companies, the Sellers or any of their ERISA
Affiliates incurred any Liability, including withdrawal Liability, with
respect to any such plan. No Acquired Company nor any Seller (with respect to
any Business Employee or Historical Business Employee) has any obligation to
provide post-employment or post-termination health or life insurance or other
welfare benefits to any Person, except as required by Law for which the
covered individual pays the entire cost of coverage. None of the Acquired
Companies nor any Seller (with respect to any Business Employee or Historical
Business Employee) has or could reasonably be expected to have any Liability
with respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) on account of at any time being considered a single employer under
Section 414 of the Code with any other Person.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth on Section 4.13(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement alone, or in a combination
with any other event, will not give rise to any Liability under any Seller
Employee Plan or Company Employee Plan, or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or increase the amount or cause the funding of compensation or
benefits due to any Business Employee or any employee, officer, director,
equityholder or other service provider of any Acquired Company (whether
current, former or retired) or its beneficiaries.

  

  

(d) No litigation or governmental administrative proceeding, audit,
investigation or other proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims
for benefits) is pending, or to the Sellers' Knowledge, threatened with
respect to any Company Employee Plan or any Seller Employee Plan that could
reasonably be expected to result in any Liability to Buyer or any Acquired
Company, and to the Sellers' Knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for any
such litigation or proceeding.

  

  

(e) All payments and/or contributions required to have been made with respect
to all Seller Employee Plans and Company Employee Plans either have been made
or have been accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable Seller
Employee Plan or Company Employee Plan, GAAP and applicable law.

4.14 International Employee Benefits Plans.

  

  

(a) The Sellers have provided to Buyer complete and correct copies of each
International Company Employee Plan and Seller Employee Plan in which a Non-US
Employee, including any spouse or dependent of a Non-US Employee,
participates. Section 4.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list of each International Company Employee Plan (none
of which are defined benefit pension plans) and separately designates each
such International Company Employee Plan with respect to which the Buyer or
any of the Acquired Companies will have any Liability following the Closing.
Each of the International Company Employee Plans has been maintained, operated
and administered in material compliance with its terms and the provisions of
applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Each International Company Employee Plan which must be registered or
qualified in the country in which it is maintained has received or timely
applied for such registration or qualification, and, to the Sellers'
Knowledge, such International Company Employee Plan has not been amended since
the date of its most recent registration or qualification (or application
therefor) in a manner that would require a new registration or qualification.

  

  

(c) All contributions, premiums, expenses and other payments required to be
made by the Sellers or their Affiliates in connection with the International
Company Employee Plans by the Closing Date have been made.

employees based in the UK or other European jurisdiction that were made
redundant in the last three years, and there is no written policy of making a
payment on redundancy in excess of the statutory minimum required by Law.

  

  

(e) The Sellers do not and no company in the Sellers' Group currently
participate in or sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of
employees or former employees located in the United Kingdom and, as a
consequence, there is no reason why the Pensions Regulator would be entitled
to issue a financial support direction or contribution notice pursuant to the
Pensions Act 2004 against the UK Acquired Company.

  

  

4.15 Insurance. The US Seller has made available to the Buyer summaries of all
material insurance policies maintained in the operation of the Business as of
the date hereof. Such policies are in full force and effect and each of the
Sellers has complied in all material respects with the provisions of such
policies. There is no claim pending under any of such policies as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such
policies or bonds. All premiums due and payable under all such policies and
bonds have been timely paid and the Sellers are otherwise in compliance with
the terms of such policies. The Sellers have no Knowledge of any threatened
termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any of such
policies. Section 4.15 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all claims made against such insurance policies
with respect to the Business during the three year period ending on the date
hereof. There are no current claims submitted by the Sellers or their
Affiliates under any such policies with respect to the Business where coverage
has been denied or disputed by the applicable insurer.

and such ITO Permits are valid and in full force and effect and the Sellers
and/or Acquired Companies are in compliance in all material respects with the
terms and conditions of such ITO Permits.

  

  

(c) No Seller or Acquired Company, nor, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, any
agent acting at any of their direction has provided, received, offered, gifted
or promised, directly or knowingly through another person, anything of value
to any Governmental Authority or any Person acting for or on behalf of any
Governmental Authority, for the purpose of: (i) influencing any act or
decision of such Governmental Authority in their official capacity, inducing
such Governmental Authority to do or omit to do any act in violation of their
lawful duty, or securing any improper advantage for any Acquired Company; or
(ii) inducing such Governmental Authority to use his or her influence to
affect or influence any act or decision of any Governmental Authority, in each
of (i) and (ii) in order to assist any Acquired Company in obtaining or
retaining business or service. Within the past three years, the Sellers and
the Acquired Companies (and their respective predecessors) have complied in
all material respects with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, and with
the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001 and other applicable anti-money laundering applicable Laws. The Sellers
and the Acquired Companies utilize controls procedures and an internal
accounting controls system sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that

licenses under the Material Contracts that are not ITO Contracts (each of
which is listed on Section 4.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and (iii)
the Buyer or the Acquired Companies obtain the benefits of the Contracts

same manner as operated by the US Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the
UK Seller and the PL Sellers) as of immediately prior to the Contribution and

Person provided that this sentence shall not affect any representation or
warranty made in Section4.10.

has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Buyer under any term, or a
failure of any condition, of the Commitment Letter or otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter in

Section 7.4 and that the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the US
Seller, each of its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives from and against, and compensate and reimburse the US Seller,
each of its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Affiliates and

in clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section 7.4(c).

  

  

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, use their reasonable best efforts to cause the respective
officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting
advisors, of the Acquired Companies to, provide to the Buyer any cooperation
reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection with the arrangement of any
debt financing the Buyer pursues in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Debt Financing"), including by
entering into one or more credit or other agreements on terms reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing immediately
prior the Closing; provided, however, that (i) no obligation of the Acquired
Companies under such credit or other agreement, or any other certificate,
document or instrument, shall be effective until Closing and none of the
Sellers or Acquired Companies shall be required to take any action under any
such agreement, or other agreement, or any other certificate, document or
instrument, that is not contingent upon the Closing (including entry into any
agreement that is effective before the Closing) or that would be effective
prior to the Closing, (ii) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the US Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies),
(iii) neither the US Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Acquired Companies from and after the Closing) shall be required to pay any
commitment fee or similar fee or incur any liability with respect to the Debt
Financing, (iv) nothing herein shall require any cooperation (x) to the extent
that it would require the board of directors of the US Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action or the US Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or to approve the execution or
delivery of any document or certificate in connection with the Financing (or
any Alternative Financing ) or (y) to the extent it would require US Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries to obtain or provide audited financial statements that
are not already in existence or any pro forma financial statements except as
otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business, and (v) no officer of
the US Seller or any of its Subsidiaries who is not reasonably expected to be
an officer of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing shall be
obligated to deliver any certificate in connection with the Financing and no
counsel for the US Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to
deliver any opinion in connection with the Financing. Upon request by the US
Seller, the Buyer shall promptly reimburse

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-54-  

  

 

  the US Seller or its Subsidiaries as the case may be, for all out-of-
pocket costs (which shall not include any costs associated with time spent by
any employee of any Seller in connection with the foregoing cooperation)
incurred by the US Seller or its subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing
cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless US Seller and its
Subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and other representatives, from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
utilized in connection with therewith (other than information provided by the
Acquired Companies).

 

  

  

7.5 Access to Information. During the period from the date hereof and prior to
the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, the US Seller
shall afford the Buyer and its accountants, counsel, financing sources, and
other Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, and upon
reasonable advance notice, to (a) all of the assets, properties, books,
Contracts, commitments and records of the US Seller and its Subsidiaries that
are reasonably related to the Business, ITO Assets, Assumed Liabilities and/or
Acquired Companies that the Buyer may reasonably request; provided, however,
that the US Seller may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents
or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the US
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or information
would waive any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information, or (iii)
access to a Contract would violate or cause a default under, or give a third
party the right to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract. In
the event that the US Seller does not provide access or information in
reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate the applicable information to the Buyer in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, waive such a privilege or result in such
a violation, default or right to terminate or accelerate. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section7.5 shall be
conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the US Seller or its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage
or destruction to any property or assets of the US Seller or its Subsidiaries.
Any access to the properties of the US Seller or its Subsidiaries shall be
subject to the US Seller's reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive testing
without the prior consent of the US Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by the Buyer
or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section7.5. Nothing in this
Section7.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the US
Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing
to prepare any new audited financial statements.

  

  

7.6 Notification of Certain Matters.

  

  

(a) The US Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing, and (ii) any failure of the
Sellers to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by them hereunder, in either case, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 3.3(b)(i) or Section 3.3(b)(ii) are not
reasonably likely to be satisfied at the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-55-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Buyer shall promptly notify the US Seller of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event that would cause any representation or warranty of
the Buyer set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior

any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder, in either case, such that the conditions set forth in Section
3.3(c)(i) or Section 3.3(c)(ii) are not reasonably likely to be satisfied at
the Closing.

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, information provided by a Party pursuant to
this Section 7.6 shall not be deemed to amend any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule attached hereto on the date hereof or to cure any breach
for purposes of Article 3 and all such information shall be disregarded for
purposes of determining any Party's obligation to consummate the Transactions
under Article 3 and any Party's rights or obligations pursuant to Article 12.

  

  

7.7 Management Arrangements. Except as expressly authorized by the US Seller,
none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall enter into any Contracts, or
shall make or enter into any formal or informal commitments, undertakings,
arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding), with any
employee of any of the US Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired
Companies) relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Business from
and after the Closing.

  

  

7.8 Exclusivity. Until the earlier of the Closing and the date upon which this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to terms hereof, the Sellers shall
not, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate or enter
into discussions or transactions with, or encourage, respond to or provide any
information to any Person or group of Persons (other than the Buyer and its
Representatives) concerning, any sale, financing, lease, or license, whether
by merger, recapitalization, reorganization, or otherwise, of all or any
portion of the Business or the ITO Assets or Acquired Companies (whether stock
or asset related), or any other alternative to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Sellers shall promptly notify the Buyer of any
proposal, inquiry or contact hereafter made by any Person with respect to such
an alternative transaction, including the nature and terms of any such
proposal and the identity of the proposing party.

  

  

7.9 Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Sellers and the Buyer will not, and will
cause their Subsidiaries, controlled Affiliates and Representatives not to,
for a period of five years after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer or the Sellers, respectively,
disclose to any third party (other than each other and their respective
Representatives) or use any non-public, confidential or proprietary
information included in the ITO Assets or the assets of the Acquired Companies
(with respect to the Sellers) or included in the non-ITO Assets or the assets
of the Sellers or their Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) (with
respect to the Buyer); provided that the foregoing restriction will not (a)
apply to any information to the extent (i) generally available to, or known
by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation of this
Section 7.9), or (ii) independently

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-56-  

  

 

  developed by such party or any of their Affiliates (other than by the
Business prior to the Closing, in the case of the Sellers) or (b) prohibit any
disclosure (i) required by any applicable Law or Action so long as, to the
extent legally permissible, the Sellers provide the Buyer, or the Buyer
provides the Sellers, as the case may be, with reasonable prior notice of such
disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure (at the
contesting parties' sole cost and expense), or (ii) to Affiliates or
Representatives of such party. For the purposes of this Agreement, whenever
the phrase "controlled Affiliate" is used with respect to the Buyer, such
phrase shall only mean the Subsidiaries of the Buyer and the officers,
directors and employees of the Buyer and such Subsidiaries.

 

  

  

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing and shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as
of the Closing; provided, however, that if this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to a Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Parties"), for and from any and all manners of actions, causes, causes of
action, suits, debts, dues, compensation, wages, bonuses, liabilities, losses,
damages, rights, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs), bonds,
bills, covenants, contracts, controversies, executions, claims and demands, of
whatever kind or nature, in law or in equity, known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, vested or contingent, matured or unmatured, suspected or
unsuspected, and whether or not concealed or hidden, whichever have or may
have existed, or which do exist, that may now or hereafter at any time be made
or brought against any Seller Released Party by such Seller Releasing Party by
reason of or in connection with any matter, cause, thing, action or omission
whatsoever, arising, occurring, relating to or in respect of any time up
through and including the Closing Date (collectively, "Seller Causes of
Action"); provided, however, that the term "Seller Causes of Action" shall not
include and nothing in this paragraph will release any Seller Released Party
from any obligations arising out of, relating to or under (i) this Agreement,
(ii) any Transaction Agreement accruing after the Closing, (iii) the failure
to perform under Contracts after Closing, and (iv) any liabilities that accrue
after Closing, including pursuant to Contracts entered into between a Seller
Releasing Party and an Acquired Company prior to the Closing (such Seller
Causes of Action, other than those described in this exclusion, collectively,
the "Seller Released Matters"). From and after the date hereof, each Seller
agrees (on behalf of itself and each other Seller Releasing Party) to not,
directly or indirectly (including in a derivative proceeding), assert any

not presently suspect to exist. Each Seller agrees, represents and warrants
that such Seller realizes and acknowledges that factual matters now unknown to
it may have given or may hereafter give rise to Seller Released Matters which
are presently unknown and unsuspected, and such Seller further agrees,
represents and warrants that the waivers and releases herein have been
negotiated and agreed upon in light of that realization and that such Seller
nevertheless hereby intends to release, discharge and acquit the Seller
Released Parties from any such unknown Seller Released Matters. Each Seller
acknowledges that the inclusion of unknown and unsuspected claims was
separately bargained for and was a key element of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Each Seller hereby represents to the Buyer that such Seller has not
transferred or assigned any Seller Released Matters or possible Seller
Released Matters against any Seller Released Party.

nature, in law or in equity, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, vested
or contingent, matured or unmatured, suspected or unsuspected, and whether or
not concealed or hidden, whichever have or may have existed, or which do
exist, that may now or hereafter at any time be made or brought against any
Buyer Released Party by such Buyer Releasing Party by reason of or in
connection with any matter, cause, thing, action or omission whatsoever,
arising, occurring, relating to or in respect of any time up through and
including the Closing Date (collectively, "Buyer Causes of Action"); provided,
however, that the term "Buyer Causes of Action" shall not include and nothing
in this paragraph will release any Buyer Released Party from any obligations
arising out of, relating to or under (i) this Agreement, (ii) any Transaction
Agreement accruing after the Closing, (iii) the failure to perform under
Contracts after Closing, and (iv) any liabilities that accrue after Closing,
including pursuant to Contracts entered into between a Seller Releasing Party
and an Acquired Company prior to the Closing (such Buyer Causes of Action,
other than those described in this exclusion, collectively, the "Buyer
Released Matters"). From and after the date hereof, each Buyer agrees (on
behalf of itself and each other Buyer Releasing Party) to not, directly or
indirectly (including in a derivative proceeding), assert any claim or demand
or commence, institute or maintain, or cause to be commenced, instituted, or
maintained, or knowingly facilitate or assist any other party in commencing,
instituting or maintaining, any claim or proceeding of any kind against any of
the Buyer Released Parties based upon or with respect to any Buyer Released
Matter(s).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-58-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Buyer acknowledges on behalf of itself and each Buyer Releasing Party that
the release in Section 7.11(a) includes releases of Buyer Released Matters of
which Buyer is presently unaware or of which Buyer does not presently suspect
to exist. Buyer agrees, represents and warrants that Buyer realizes and
acknowledges that factual matters now unknown to it may have given or may
hereafter give rise to Buyer Released Matters which are presently unknown and
unsuspected, and Buyer further agrees, represents and warrants that the
waivers and releases herein have been negotiated and agreed upon in light of
that realization and that Buyer nevertheless hereby intends to release,
discharge and acquit the Buyer Released Parties from any such unknown Buyer
Released Matters. Buyer acknowledges that the inclusion of unknown and
unsuspected claims was separately bargained for and was a key element of this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) Buyer hereby represents to the Sellers that Buyer has not transferred or
assigned any Buyer Released Matters or possible Buyer Released Matters against
any Buyer Released Party.

  

  

7.12 Insurance Cooperation. Following the Closing, Buyer and the Acquired
Companies will retain the right to assert claims (and the Sellers will use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and the Acquired Companies in
asserting such claims) for any loss, liability or damage with respect to the
Acquired Companies or the Business under any "occurrence basis" insurance
policies of the Sellers or their Subsidiaries which are in effect as of the
Closing Date with third-party insurers, and which provide coverage with
respect to the Acquired Companies or the Business (as named insureds or
otherwise) arising out of insured incidents occurring prior to the Closing
Date.

  

  

ARTICLE 8

  

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  

  

8.1 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) As of the date hereof, Section 8.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a complete and accurate list of: (i) each Business Employee on US
Seller's US payroll (each, a "US Business Employee"), (ii) each person who
would be a UK Business Employee in the event that the Closing Date took place
on the date of this Agreement, (iii) each person who would be a PL Business
Employee in the event that the Closing Date took place on the date of this
Agreement and (iv) each Business Employee who is not (A) on US Seller's US
payroll or (B) on UK Seller's UK payroll or otherwise based in the UK or (C)
on either of the PL Sellers' PL payroll (each in this Section 8.1(a) being an
"Other Business Employee"). Prior to the Closing, US Seller shall deliver to
the Buyer an updated version to Section 8.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule that is complete and accurate as of the Closing. Those US Business
Employees and Other Business Employees (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding UK Business Employees, employees otherwise based in the UK, and
Business Employees on either of the PL Sellers' PL payroll) who continue

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-59-  

  

 

  employment with Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries immediately following the
Closing Date shall be referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." Any US
Business Employee who as of the Closing is receiving or eligible to receive
disability or is not working and receiving workers' compensation benefits
shall, in either case, become and remain an employee of the US Seller
effective as of the Closing, and the US Seller shall assume and retain all
Liabilities relating to such US Business Employee and shall provide such US
Business Employee with disability and workers' compensation coverage under the
applicable Seller Employee Plan and/or applicable law, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with the express written consent of the Buyer,
any such US Business Employee may become a Transferred Employee if such
employee is able to and does return to work for the US Acquired Company within
three (3) months following the Closing and satisfies applicable legal
requirements to work for Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
or at such later date as required by applicable law.

 

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3, the Buyer will, or will cause
one of its Subsidiaries, to provide each Transferred Employee with:

  

  

(i) for at least six (6) months after the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the
date of termination of employment of the Transferred Employee), cash
compensation, including base salary (or base wage, as applicable) rate and
target annual bonus and/or commission opportunity (excluding any equity-based
compensation or opportunity or long-term compensation or opportunity), on
terms that are in the aggregate reasonably comparable to the total cash
compensation opportunity provided to the Transferred Employee on the date
hereof. Nothing herein shall (A) require the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (including any of the Acquired Companies) to continue the
employment of or any particular term or condition of employment of any
Transferred Employee, or (B) subject to compliance with the foregoing
provisions of this subsection (b)(i), limit the Buyer's (or any of its
Subsidiaries' or Affiliates') ability and discretion to change or amend the
total cash compensation opportunity to which a Transferred Employee may be
entitled;

  

  

(ii) for six (6) months after the Closing Date, severance benefits that are
equal to the severance benefits set forth on Section 8.1(b)(ii) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule; and

  

  

(iii) for at least six (6) months after the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the
date of termination of employment of the Transferred Employee), benefits
(excluding severance, cash incentive compensation or cash benefits, equity
based compensation or benefits, defined benefit pension plan benefits, any and
all non-qualified deferred compensation plan benefits and any and all post-
termination/ retiree welfare benefits) to each Transferred Employee that,
taken as a whole, are reasonably comparable in the aggregate to the benefits
(excluding severance, cash incentive compensation or cash benefits, equity
based benefits or compensation, defined benefit pension plan benefits, any and
all non-qualified deferred compensation plan benefits and any and all post-
termination/ retiree welfare benefits) provided to the Transferred Employee on
the date hereof; provided, however, that neither the Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company after the Closing) shall be
required to make any 401(k) (or similar) plan available until forty-five (45)
days after the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-60-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Except as required by applicable Law, as is provided in the Master
Services Agreement, or as may be otherwise agreed to in writing by the US
Seller and the Buyer, as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall
cease to participate and accrue further benefits under any Seller Employee
Plans. Except to the extent expressly included in the Assumed Liabilities, the
Sellers shall assume or retain, as applicable, the sponsorship of and be
solely responsible for all Liabilities relating to or at any time arising
under or in connection with any Seller Employee Plan, any Company Employee
Plan, any International Company Employee Plan, any Employee Benefit Plan and
any other compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement, contract, policy
or arrangement of any kind at any time maintained, sponsored or contributed to
or required to be contributed to by either Seller, any of the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or with respect to which
either Seller, any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates has any Liability; provided, however, that Seller and its
Affiliates shall in no way be responsible for any Employee Benefit Plan
maintained, sponsored or contributed to or required to be contributed to by
Buyer and its Affiliates at any time prior to the Closing, or that is first
established by any of the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates after the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt the provisions of this Section 8.1(c)
shall not apply to any employees or Liabilities in the United Kingdom or
Poland.

  

  

(d) The US Seller shall retain all Liabilities relating to COBRA, including
with respect to any "qualifying event," (as defined under COBRA) and
Liabilities under similar applicable Laws incurred on or prior to the Closing
Date. Following the Closing Date, to the extent required by Law, the Buyer or
its applicable Affiliate shall be responsible for providing notices and making
available group health care continuation coverage as required by COBRA for all
of the Transferred Employees and former Transferred Employees and their
respective covered dependents, whose "qualifying events" (as defined under
COBRA) occur after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt the provisions
of this Section 8.1(d) shall not apply to any employees or Liabilities in the
United Kingdom or Poland.

  

  

(e) In respect of the Transferred Employees, the Sellers and the Buyer agree
that, pursuant to the "Alternative Procedures" provided in Section 5 of
Revenue Procedure 2004-53, with respect to the filing and furnishing of IRS
Forms W-2, W-3 and 941 for the full calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs, (i) the US Seller and US Acquired Company shall report on a
"predecessor-successor" basis, as set forth therein, (ii) the US Seller shall
be relieved from furnishing Forms W-2 to any Transferred Employees, and (iii)
the US Acquired Company shall assume the obligations of Seller to furnish
Forms W-2 to such US Business Employees who are Transferred Employees and
Forms W-2 and W-3 with respect to Transferred Employees to the Social Security
Administration; provided that, the US Seller shall, at the Closing, transfer
to the US Acquired Company all Forms W-4 and W-5 with respect to the US
Business Employees who are Transferred Employees, and such other data
information and documents relating to US Business Employees who are
Transferred Employees (including records of all (1) wages and bonuses paid and
(2) Taxes withheld and paid) as shall be necessary for the US Acquired Company
to assume and satisfy such obligations accurately and in accordance with Law.

  

  

(f) The Buyer and the US Seller shall, or shall cause one of their
Subsidiaries to, take all actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective
as of the Closing Date, (i) the account balances (whether positive or
negative) (the "Transferred Account Balances") under any Seller Employee Plans
that are health and dependent care flexible spending account plans (the
"FSAs") of the US Business Employees who are Transferred Employees who are

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-61-  

  

 

  participants in the Seller's FSAs (the "Covered Employees") shall be
transferred to one or more comparable plans of the Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries (the "Buyer FSAs"); (ii) the elections, contribution levels and
coverage levels of the Covered Employees shall apply under the Buyer FSAs in
the same manner as under the Seller's FSAs; provided that the US Seller has
provided all data necessary to Buyer to reflect such application; and (iii)
the Covered Employees shall be reimbursed from the Buyer FSAs for claims (A)
incurred at any time during the plan year of the Seller's FSAs in which the
Closing Date occurs, and (B) submitted to the Buyer FSAs from and after the
Closing Date, substantially on the same basis, terms and conditions as under
the Seller's FSAs. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
Date, the US Seller will transfer cash to the Buyer in respect of the Covered
Employees if and in the amount that employee deferrals under the FSAs exceed
their corresponding paid claims as of the Closing, and the Buyer will transfer
cash to the US Seller in respect of the Covered Employees if and in the amount
that paid claims exceed corresponding employee deferrals as of the Closing.

 

  

  

(g) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall take commercially reasonable
efforts to provide each Transferred Employee with credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit accrual including under a defined
benefit plan intended to benefit employees located in the US), under the
employee benefits plans of the Buyer (or one of its Subsidiaries) in which
such Transferred Employee participates or will be eligible to participate in
the calendar year of the Closing ("Buyer Benefits Plans") for service on and
prior to the Closing Date with the Sellers and their Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor employer to such entities), including recognition of such service
for purposes of determining Transferred Employees' amount of paid time off or
vacation and severance benefits, but only to the extent any such service was
credited under an analogous Seller Employee Plan by the US Seller for a
similar purpose; provided that in no event shall the Buyer be required to
provide any service credit to any Transferred Employee to the extent the
provision of such credit would result in any duplication of benefits. Buyer
will transfer all available, previously-accrued paid time off or vacation
time, as of the Closing Date and as accrued in accordance with the applicable
paid time off or vacation policy of the Sellers consistent with past
accounting practices, for each Transferred Employee, effective as of the
Closing. The Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any preexisting conditions or limitations (or actively at
work or similar limitations), evidence of insurability requirements and
eligibility waiting periods under any Buyer Benefits Plan that provides health
or medical benefits to be waived with respect to Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents to the extent that such conditions, limitations,
requirements or waiting periods were waived or satisfied by such Transferred
Employees under the analogous Seller Employee Plan that provides health or
medical benefits.

  

  

8.2 Employment-Related Assumed Liabilities. Subject to Section 2.3, the Buyer,
to the exclusion of the US Seller, shall be fully responsible for any and all
Liabilities arising out of or relating to: (a) the Buyer's employment
following the Closing or termination of employment after the Closing of any
Transferred Employee; (b) any Buyer Benefit Plans; and (c) workers'
compensation claims of Transferred Employees arising out of conditions with a
date of injury (or, in the case of a claim relating to occupational illness or
disease, the last significant exposure) after the Closing Date (collectively
referred to herein as "Post-Closing Date Employment Liabilities"). All Post-
Closing Date

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-62-  

  

 

  Employment Liabilities shall be Assumed Liabilities for all purposes of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Post-Closing Date Employment
Liabilities shall not include any Severance Expenses for which Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 2.3 or any liabilities or payments owed
pursuant to any of the US Seller retention agreements or Seller Employee Plan
listed on Section 4.13(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (other than the
severance benefits described in Section 8.1(b)(ii) (subject to the provisions
of Section 2.3)).

 

  

  

8.3 UK Business Employees.

  

  

(a) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall make
arrangements and procure the necessary employee benefit plans, contracts,
and/or agreements for the UK Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to comply with the covenants set forth in Sections 8.3(b) and
8.3(d) below. Those of the UK Business Employees who are named on the updated
Section 8.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule required to be provided
pursuant to Section 8.1 above shall be referred to herein as "UK Transferred
Employees". For the avoidance of doubt, the UK Transferred Employees shall not
include any persons whose employment does not transfer to the UK Acquired
Company on Closing, for whatever reason and any employee who is not on the
list of UK Business Employees shall not be a UK Transferred Employee.

  

  

(b) The Buyer:

  

  

(i) Shall procure that immediately following the Closing Date, all UK
Transferred Employees shall be employed on the same or substantially similar
terms and conditions of employment and other benefits of or in connection with
employment (including but not limited to any pensions rights (to the extent
that such rights transfer under the Transfer Regulations) or benefits but
excluding any and all defined benefit pension rights) as applied immediately
prior to the transfer of their employment from the UK Seller to the UK
Acquired Company, and shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any
liabilities arising from any failure to procure this, or any attempt to change
any terms and conditions of employment and/or any other benefits of or in
connection with employment on or after the Closing Date;

  

  

(ii) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities arising
out of the Buyer's failure to comply with any of its obligations set forth in
Section 8.3(a) and/or Section 8.3(b)(i) except to the extent that such failure
is a result of the Sellers failing to comply with their obligations under the
Transfer Regulations (and, in particular, Regulations 11(1) to (3) and
Regulation 13 and Regulation 14);

  

  

(iii) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities
arising out of the employment or termination of employment of any of the UK
Transferred Employees on or after the Closing except to the extent that such
failure is a result of the Sellers failing to comply with their obligations
under the Transfer Regulations (and, in particular, Regulations 11(1) to (3)
and Regulation 13 and Regulation 14);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-63-  

  

 

 

 

  

(iv) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities in
relation to any UK Business Employee arising from a change or anticipated
change by the UK Acquired Company to that UK Business Employee's terms and
conditions of employment and/or working conditions on or after the Closing,
including but not limited to any liabilities arising from any claim or
allegation of unfair dismissal and/or constructive dismissal in circumstances
envisaged in Regulation 4(9) and/or Regulation 4(11) of TUPE and/or otherwise
envisaged in the Transfer Regulations (except to the extent that such failure
is a result of the Sellers failing to comply with their obligations under the
Transfer Regulations (and, in particular, Regulations 11(1) to (3) and
Regulation 13 and Regulation 14)) (it being understood that reference in this
Section 8.3(b)(iv) to a UK Business Employee includes (without limitation) any
individual who would have been a UK Business Employee had their employment not
terminated prior to the Closing Date); and

  

  

(v) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities arising
out of any failure by the Buyer to tell any of the Sellers in good time prior
to the Closing Date what measures it (or any of its current or future
subsidiaries including the UK Acquired Company) envisages taking on or after
the Closing Date in respect of any affected UK Business Employee (except to
the extent that such failure is a result of the Sellers failing to comply with
their obligations under the Transfer Regulations (and, in particular,
Regulations 11(1) to (3) and Regulation 13 and Regulation 14)) including any
liabilities suffered or incurred by any of the Sellers arising from any
failure by the UK Seller (or the UK Acquired Company prior to the Closing
Date) to comply with its obligations to properly inform and/or consult
pursuant to the Transfer Regulations (and/or, in the case of the UK Acquired
Company, to comply with its obligations under Regulation 13(4) of TUPE in
relation to the transfer of staff from the UK Seller to the UK Acquired
Company) and in each case only to the extent that such failure arises from the
failure by the Buyer to inform the UK Seller and/or the UK Acquired Company in
good time of any measures it envisages taking (or it envisages the UK Acquired
Company or any other subsidiary taking) in respect of any affected employees,
or confirming to the UK Seller and/or the UK Acquired Company that it does not
envisage taking any such measures;

  

  

(vi) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of all liabilities
suffered or incurred by any of the Sellers arising out of the non-payment or
under-payment of salaries, wages, bonuses, overtime, holiday pay, PAYE and/or
National Insurance contributions together with any over-deduction of pension
contributions, or failure to provide benefits of employment, in relation to
any of the UK Transferred Employees in respect of the period on or after the
Closing; and

  

  

(vii) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities
arising as a result of the Buyer's failure to comply or failure to procure
compliance with Part 1 of the Pensions Act 2008 in relation to any UK
Transferred Employee on and after Closing.

  

  

(c) The Sellers:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-64-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Shall indemnify the Buyer and the UK Acquired Company in respect of all
Liabilities suffered or incurred by the Buyer and/or the UK Acquired Company
arising out of the non-payment or under-payment of salaries, wages, bonuses,
overtime, holiday pay, pension contributions and payments, PAYE and/or
National Insurance contributions or any other sums due to or payable in
relation to the UK Business Employees solely in respect of and referable to
any period up to the Closing (whether arising under common law, statute,
equity or otherwise);

  

  

(ii) Shall indemnify the Buyer and UK Acquired Company in respect of any claim
by on behalf of or in relation to any UK Transferred Employee or order or
notice issued by the UK Pensions Regulator arising from the UK Transferred
Employee's employment with the UK Seller or that relevant UK Business
Employee's previous employer or employers prior to the Closing, including but
not limited to any such claim brought in the UK Employment Tribunal and any
claim in relation to a defined benefit pension scheme;

  

  

(iii) Shall indemnify the Buyer, the UK Acquired Company and each of their
respective Subsidiaries against all Liabilities in respect or arising directly
or indirectly as a result of any entitlement to the payment or provision of
benefits or sums of money (on retirement, redundancy, early retirement,
disability or otherwise) calculated by reference to any provision or
membership of the Acxiom Limited Retirement Benefit Scheme and against any
contribution notice or financial support direction (as those terms are defined
in section 38 to 51 Pensions Act 2004) issued by the Pensions Regulator (or
any connected or associated company as those terms are defined in sections 38
to 51 Pensions Act 2004);

  

  

(iv) Confirm that no redundancies or redundancy processes have commenced, are
underway or are contemplated in respect of the UK Business Employees, save as
disclosed by the Sellers in the Seller Disclosure Schedule;

  

  

(v) Shall indemnify the Buyer and the UK Acquired Company in respect of any
claim by, on behalf of or in relation to any UK Business Employee arising in
respect of all Liabilities suffered or incurred by the Buyer or the UK
Acquired Company in respect of or arising from a failure of the UK Seller to
comply with its obligations under the Transfer Regulation (and in particular,
Regulation 11(1) to (3) and Regulation 13 and Regulation 14) except for any
failure of the Buyer to comply with its obligations under Section 8.3(b)(v);
and

  

  

(vi) Shall indemnify the Buyer and the UK Acquired Company in respect of all
Liabilities suffered or incurred by the Buyer and the UK Acquired Company in
relation to any UK Business Employee (except Timothy Sillwood) who is or
claims to be employed on any contractual term (except for those specific
"TUPE-transferred legacy terms" set out in the Seller Disclosure Schedule -
Section 4.14(a) headed Ex CSC (Marlow based) employees - legacy benefits plan)
which is different to the employment contract provided to but not signed by
each of the UK Business Employees in 2013.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-65-  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) The UK Seller and the Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries shall comply
with all obligations either under the Transfer Regulations or other similar
country-specific legal standards or applicable Laws to notify and/or consult
with UK Business Employees or employee representatives, unions, works councils
or other employee representative bodies, if any, and shall provide such
information to the other Party as is required by that Party to comply with its
notification and/or consultation obligations. In particular, the UK Seller
shall (subject to Section 8.3(b)(v)) undertake all information and
consultation obligations pursuant to Regulation 13 of TUPE in relation to the
UK Business Employees and the Buyer shall comply with its obligations under
Regulation 13(4) of TUPE (and shall provide the UK Acquired Company with such
information at such time as it needs to comply with its obligations under
Regulation 13(4) of TUPE) and the parties agree to co-operate with each other
in relation to the information and consultation exercise.

  

  

(e) The UK Seller and its Subsidiaries will not, without the Buyer's consent,
prior to the Closing, make any material changes to the working conditions of
the UK Business Employees, save as disclosed to the Buyer in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that the Sellers are under no
obligation to ensure that the UK Business Employees shall transfer their
employment to the UK Acquired Company, and it is acknowledged that as a matter
of law they have a right to object to such transfer.

  

  

(g) The Buyer will give the UK Seller within a reasonable period of time after
the date of this Agreement such information as will enable the UK Seller to
inform employee representatives of the measures which the Buyer envisages
taking (or the Buyer envisages the UK Acquired Company taking) on or after the
Closing in relation to the UK Business Employees.

  

  

(h) If in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement any
person whose name is not listed as a UK Transferred Employee in the updated
version to Section 8.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule required to be
provided pursuant to Section 8.1 above transfers to the UK Acquired Company on
the Closing Date pursuant to TUPE or claims an entitlement to transfer to the
UK Acquired Company on the Closing Date pursuant to TUPE (such person being
defined as the "Unlisted UK Employee"):

  

  

(i) the UK Acquired Company may within 14 days of becoming aware of such
actual or alleged transfer terminate the employment of the Unlisted UK
Employee; and

  

  

(ii) subject to Section 8.3(i) below the Sellers shall indemnify and hold the
Buyer and the UK Acquired Company harmless against all Liabilities that the
Buyer and the UK Acquired Company may suffer, incur, sustain, pay or be put to
by reason of, on account of or arising out of such termination of employment.

  

  

(i) The Sellers shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the Buyer
or the UK Acquired Company pursuant to Section 8.3(h) above in respect of:

  

  

(i) any Liabilities arising out of any actual or alleged discriminatory act or
omission of the UK Acquired Company (on or after the Closing Date) or of the
Buyer, except to the extent that the actual or alleged discriminatory act or
dismissal by the UK Acquired Company or Buyer arises from or is in relation to
the transfer (or failure to transfer) and/or the termination of employment of
the relevant Unlisted UK Employee; or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-66-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) any Liabilities arising from the UK Acquired Company (on or after the
Closing Date) or the Buyer voluntarily making any payment to or in respect of
the Unlisted UK Employee or conferring any benefit to or in respect of the
Unlisted UK Employee without the prior written consent of the UK Seller.

  

  

8.4 PL Business Employees.

  

  

(a) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall make
arrangements and procure the necessary employee benefit plans, contracts,
and/or agreements for the PL Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to comply with the covenants set forth in Sections 8.4(b) and
8.4(d) below. Those of the PL Business Employees who are named on the updated
Section 8.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule required to be provided
pursuant to Section 8.1 above shall be referred to herein as "PL Transferred
Employees". For the avoidance of doubt, the PL Transferred Employees shall not
include any persons whose employment does not transfer to the PL Acquired
Company on Closing, for whatever reason.

  

  

(b) The Buyer:

  

  

(i) Shall procure that immediately following the Closing Date, all PL
Transferred Employees shall be employed on the same terms and conditions of
employment and other benefits of or in connection with employment (including
but not limited to any pensions rights (to the extent that such rights
transfer under the Transfer Regulations) or benefits) as applied immediately
prior to the transfer of their employment from the PL Sellers to the PL
Acquired Company, and shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any
liabilities arising from any failure to procure this, or any attempt to change
any terms and conditions of employment and/or any other benefits of or in
connection with employment on or after the Closing Date;

  

  

(ii) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities arising
out of the Buyer's failure to comply with any of its obligations set forth in
Section 8.4(a) and/or Section 8.4(b)(i);

  

  

(iii) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities
arising out of the employment or termination of employment of any of the PL
Transferred Employees on or after the Closing;

  

  

(iv) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of any liabilities in
relation to any PL Transferred Employee arising from a change or anticipated
change to that PL Transferred Employee's terms and conditions of employment
and/or working conditions on or after the Closing, including but not limited
to any liabilities arising from any claim or allegations of unfair dismissal
in circumstances envisaged in Transfer Regulations; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-67-  

  

 

 

 

  

(v) Shall indemnify each of the Sellers in respect of all liabilities suffered
or incurred by any of the Sellers arising out of the non-payment or under-
payment of salaries, wages, bonuses, overtime, holiday pay, income tax
withholdings, together with any due statutory interests, and/or social
security contributions, together with any due statutory interests, or State
Fund for the Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons contributions, together with
any due statutory interests, or failure to provide benefits of employment, in
relation to any of the PL Transferred Employees in respect of the period on or
after the Closing.

  

  

(c) The Sellers:

  

  

(i) Shall indemnify the Buyer in respect of all Liabilities suffered or
incurred by the Buyer arising out of the non-payment or under-payment of
salaries, wages, bonuses, overtime, holiday pay, income tax withholdings,

contributions, together with any due statutory interests or the Social
Benefits Fund, together with any due statutory interests, State Fund for the
Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons contributions, together with any due
statutory interests or any other sums due to or payable in relation to the PL
Transferred Employees in respect of any period up to the Closing; and

  

  

(ii) Shall indemnify the Buyer in respect of any claim by on behalf of or in
relation to any PL Transferred Employee arising solely from the PL Business
Employee's employment with the PL Sellers prior to the Closing, irrespective
of whether it was due or not prior to the Closing; and

  

  

(iii) Confirm that no redundancies or redundancy, including individual
dismissals for reasons not associated to an employee, processes have
commenced, are underway or are contemplated in respect of the PL Transferred

Employees whose majority of tasks and duties at the PL Seller 1 are connected
with ITO Business; and

  

  

(v) Confirm that at the Closing none of the PL Transferred Employees is

shall indemnify and hold the Buyer and the PL Acquired Company harmless
against all Liabilities that the Buyer and the PL Acquired Company may suffer,
incur, sustain, pay or be put to by reason of, on account of or arising out of
any PL Transferred Employee being covered at the Closing by any such global
equity based compensation or benefits plan.

comply with all obligations under applicable Laws to notify and/or consult
with PL Business Employees or employee representatives, unions, works councils
or other employee representative bodies, if any, and shall provide such
information to the other Party as is required by that Party to comply with its
notification and/or consultation obligations. In particular, the PL Sellers
shall undertake all information and consultation obligations in relation to
the PL Business Employees and the Buyer shall comply with its obligations
under the Transfer Regulations and the parties agree to co-operate and consult
with each other in relation to the information and consultation exercise. The
PL Sellers and the Buyer shall indemnify each other against all Liabilities
resulting from any failure of the other to notify and/or consult or to provide
such information in a timely manner and in the manner required by the Transfer
Regulations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-68-  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) The PL Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries will not, without the
Buyer's consent, prior to the Closing, make any material changes to the
working conditions of the PL Business Employees, save as disclosed to the
Buyer in the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that as a matter of Law,
the PL Business Employees have a right to terminate their employment within
the first two (2) months after being transferred to the PL Acquired Company,
upon seven (7) days' notice.

  

  

(g) The Buyer will give the PL Sellers within a reasonable period of time
after the date of this Agreement such information as will enable the PL
Sellers to inform employee representatives of the measures which the Buyer
envisages taking (or the Buyer envisages the PL Acquired Company taking) on or
after the Closing in relation to the PL Business Employees, if applicable. The
PL Sellers undertake to provide the Buyer with any information or documents
required to assess whether any such measures will be required.

  

  

(h) If in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement any
person whose name is not listed in the updated version to Section 8.1(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule required to be provided pursuant to Section 8.1
above transfers to the PL Acquired Company on the Closing Date pursuant to
Transfer Regulations or claims an entitlement to transfer to the PL Acquired
Company pursuant to Transfer Regulations on the Closing Date (such person
being defined as the "Unlisted PL Employee"):

  

  

(i) subject to Section 8.4(i) below, the Sellers shall indemnify and hold the
Buyer and the PL Acquired Company harmless against all Liabilities that the
Buyer and the PL Acquired Company may suffer, incur, sustain, pay or be put to
by reason of, on account of or arising out of employment of any Unlisted PL
Employee and dismissal of the Unlisted PL Employee once it will be legally and
lawfully admissible.

  

  

(i) The Sellers shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the Buyer
or the PL Acquired Company pursuant to Section 8.4(h) above in respect of:

  

  

(i) any Liabilities to the extent that they arise or are increased by reason
of any failure by the PL Acquired Company and/or the Buyer to follow a fair
procedure in relation to any termination of employment; or

  

  

(ii) any Liabilities arising out of any actual or alleged discriminatory act
or omission of the PL Acquired Company (on or after the Closing Date) or of
the Buyer.

  

  

8.5 Cooperation. Subject to the requirements of any applicable data privacy
Laws, the Parties agree to fully cooperate with respect to the transfer of
employee data relating to the Business Employees necessary to carry out their
obligations set forth in this Article 8.

8.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Article 8 are included for the sole benefit of
the respective Parties and shall not create any right, including any third-
party beneficiary right, (a) in any other Person, including, without
limitation, any Employees, former Employees, any participant in any Company
Employee Plan, Seller Employee Plan, or International Company Employee Plan or
any beneficiary thereof or (b) to continued employment with the US Seller or
the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Except as may be
required by Law (including TUPE), nothing in this Article 8, express or
implied, shall: (i) limit the ability of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, follow the Closing, any Acquired Company) to terminate the
employment of any employee (including any Transferred Employee) at any time
and for any or no reason; (ii) be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, contract or
arrangement; or (iii) limit the ability of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates

terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy,
contract or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them.

Companies or their Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax

attributable to any payments made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any amounts included in Seller Transaction Expenses or paid in
connection with the termination of any Business Employee by the Buyer or any
Acquired Company after the Closing (provided, however, that this exclusion
shall not effect any of the Buyer's rights under Section 2.3), and (v)
Transfer Taxes to the extent of US Seller's liability pursuant to Section 9.4.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary and for the avoidance of doubt, the
Sellers shall not be liable to indemnify the Buyer or any of its Affiliates

(b) The Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller Indemnitees harmless against any
Losses as result of: (i) Taxes imposed on any of the Acquired Companies or
with respect to the ITO Assets for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date (each, a "Post-Closing Tax Period"), except
for (A) Losses for which the Buyer and its Affiliates are entitled to be
indemnified under Section 9.1(a), and any interest, penalties or additions to

9.2 Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) The US Seller shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and
timely filed when due (taking into account valid extensions) (i) all Tax
Returns of or with respect to any of the Acquired Companies or the ITO Assets
that are required to be filed on or after the date hereof and on or before the
Closing Date and (ii) all income Tax Returns of or with respect to any of the
Acquired Companies for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(collectively "Seller Returns"). All such Seller Returns shall be prepared
timely in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Acquired Companies
unless otherwise required by applicable Law and the provisions of this
Agreement. The Sellers shall pay all such Taxes shown on such Tax Returns.

  

  

(b) Except for Seller Returns and only if not filed prior to the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
(taking into account valid extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to the ITO Assets or any of the Acquired Companies
for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date the due date of
which (taking into account extensions of time to file) is after the Closing
Date, or for any Straddle Period (the "Buyer Returns"). All such Buyer Returns
relating to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Closing Date shall be prepared timely in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Acquired Companies unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

  

  

(c) Any material Tax Return relating to any Tax period or portion thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date required to be filed with respect to
any of the Acquired Companies under this Section 9.2 (other than any return of
any Seller filed on an affiliated, consolidated combined or unitary basis)
shall be submitted (with copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and
other documentation then available) by the Party responsible pursuant to this
Agreement for filing such Tax Return (the "Filing Party") to the other Party
(the "Non-Filing Party") for the Non-Filing Party's review and comment not
less than twenty (20) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return (taking into account valid extensions). Any disputes between the Filing
Party and the Non-Filing Party shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, whose
costs shall be borne substantially in accordance with Section 2.1(h).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-71-  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) To the extent the Filing Party is required to remit any Taxes that the
Non-Filing Party is responsible pursuant to this Agreement to pay, the Non-
Filing Party shall pay to the Filing Party any such Taxes within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of a detailed computation in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Non-Filing Party of the amount of such Taxes.

  

  

9.3 Computation of Tax Liabilities.

  

  

(a) To the extent permitted or required by Law or administrative practice, the
taxable year of each of the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries that
includes the Closing Date shall be closed, and in all events shall be treated
as closing, on (and including) the Closing Date and all transactions and items
occurring or accruing on the Closing Date shall be allocated to and reflected
on the Tax Returns of the Sellers or the Acquired Companies (as applicable)
for the tax period ending on the Closing Date, provided, however, that any
transaction not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing
Date after the Closing and occurring at the direction of Buyer or its
Affiliates, including any Tax election or any restructuring with respect to
the Acquired Companies, shall be reported on the Buyer's consolidated U.S.
federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), and shall be similarly reported on other Tax
Returns of the Buyer or its Affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

  

  

(b) In the case of any taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date (each, a "Straddle Period") of any Person, the Taxes imposed upon
any of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be computed on an interim closing of the books basis
as if such taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date (treating the
taxable year of any entity in which such person owns an interest as closing on
such date for such purpose), provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions), other than with respect to property placed in
service after the Closing, and Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as
property Taxes) shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle
Period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such
portion of the Straddle Period.

  

  

(c) In determining the Sellers' liability for Taxes pursuant to this
Agreement, the Seller shall be credited with the amount of estimated Taxes
paid by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies or with respect to the
ITO Assets prior to the Closing. To the extent that the Sellers' liability for
Taxes for a taxable year or period is less than the amount of estimated Taxes
previously paid by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies or with respect to
the ITO Assets for such taxable year or period, without duplication, the Buyer
shall pay the US Seller any refunds or credits of such amounts in accordance
with Section 9.5.

  

  

9.4 Transfer Taxes. All sales (including bulk sales), use, transfer, value-
added, goods and services, recording, ad valorem, privilege, documentary,
gains, gross receipts, registration, conveyance, excise, license, stamp,
duties or similar Taxes and fees resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (but excluding income and other similar Taxes on any gains
incurred by any Seller resulting from the sale of Acquired Stock pursuant to
this

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-72-  

  

 

  Agreement) ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fifty percent by the US
Seller and fifty percent by the Buyer. The US Seller and the Buyer shall
cooperate with each other and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement,
take any action reasonably requested by the other Party that does not cause
such Party to incur any cost or material inconvenience in order to minimize
Transfer Taxes, including timely signing and delivering such certificates or
forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or
otherwise reduce) Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with such
Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due (taking into account valid
extensions), with the expense thereof borne fifty percent by the US Seller and
fifty percent by the Buyer, by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and the Filing
Party will use its reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the Non-
Filing Party at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date (taking
into account valid extensions) for such Tax Returns. Transfer Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns shall be timely paid in full when due by the Filing
Party, and the Non-Filing Party shall promptly remit to the Filing Party fifty
percent (50%) of such Transfer Taxes upon receipt of reasonable evidence of
the amount of such Transfer Taxes.

 

  

  

9.5 Tax Refunds.

  

  

(a) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by the
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies, and any amounts credited against Tax
in lieu of a Tax refund to which the Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies
becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns or any carryback
filing) for any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Closing Date shall be for the account of the US Seller to the extent such
Taxes were paid on or prior to the Closing or indemnified by the US Seller
hereunder. Buyer shall pay over to the US Seller any such refund or the amount
of any such credit in lieu of a Tax refund (reduced by any costs or Taxes
incurred in obtaining such refund or credit) within five (5) Business Days
after receipt or, in the case of a credit in lieu of a Tax refund, after the
Acquired Companies recognize a cash Tax savings as a result thereof. To the
extent any refund or credit that gave rise to a payment to the US Seller
pursuant to this Section 9.5 is subsequently disallowed, US Seller shall
promptly remit any such amounts to Buyer, along with any applicable interest
or penalties with respect thereto.

  

  

(b) For purposes of this Section 9.5, where it is necessary to apportion a
refund or credit in lieu of a Tax refund between the Buyer and the US Seller
for a Straddle Period, such refund or credit shall be apportioned between the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books
of the Acquired Companies as if such taxable period ended on and included the
Closing Date, except that refunds or credits of Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis shall be allocated on a daily basis but in each case applying the
principles of Section 9.3. The Buyer shall cooperate, and cause the Acquired
Companies to cooperate, in obtaining any Tax refund for any Tax period ending
on or including the Closing Date.

  

  

9.6 Post-Closing Actions Affecting the US Seller's Liability for Taxes.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-73-  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) Except as required by applicable Law after provision of notice to Seller,
none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit any
other Person to) amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return, file any
Tax Return in a jurisdiction in which such Person has not previously filed a
Tax Return, initiate or enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement or
similar agreements, or extend any applicable statute of limitations, in each
case relating in whole or in part to any of the Acquired Companies or the ITO
Assets with respect to any taxable year or period or portion thereof ending on
or before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the US Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(b) None of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall carry back for US
federal, state, local or non-US Tax purposes to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of
any of the Acquired Companies, the US Seller or any of its Affiliates, any
operating losses, net operating losses, capital losses, Tax credits or similar
items arising in, resulting from, or generated in connection with a taxable
period (or portion thereof) of the Buyer or any of its Affiliate beginning
after the Closing Date.

  

  

9.7 Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax
sharing Contracts between the US Seller, UK Seller, PL Sellers or any of their
Affiliates and any of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries shall
terminate as of the Closing and, after the Closing Date, the Buyer and the
Acquired Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

  

  

9.8 Tax Contests. Each Party hereto shall notify the other Party in writing in
accordance with Section13.2 within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by
such Party of written notice of any pending or threatened audits, notice of
deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, examination or other
administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim which could
affect the liability for Taxes of such other party ("Tax Contest"). If the
Party required to give such notice fails to do so in a timely manner, such
failure shall not relieve the other Party of its obligation under this
Agreement to indemnify for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax
Contest except to the extent that such failure to give notice materially
prejudices the other Party's right to participate in or defend the Tax
Contest. Except with respect to a Tax Contest for a Straddle Period, the US
Seller shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Acquired
Companies in any Tax Contest for which it is required to indemnify the Buyer
and its Affiliates under Section9.1 and to employ counsel of its choice at its
sole cost and expense but if and only if (i) US Seller provides written notice
to the Buyer of its election to control such Tax Contest within 10 days of
receiving notice of the Tax Contest and (ii) the US Seller confirms in writing
that the US Seller has the obligation to indemnify the Buyer and its
Affiliates hereunder with respect to any Losses or Tax related to such Tax
Contest; provided, however, that, Buyer shall be entitled to participate in
such proceedings at its own expense, and if such settlement would adversely
affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any of the Acquired
Companies) in a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing,
the US Seller shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any Tax Contest without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the case of a Tax Contest of an Acquired
Company or its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, Buyer shall control such
Tax Contest subject to the US Seller's right to participate in such
proceedings at its own expenses to the extent such Tax Contest relates to
Taxes for which it is required to indemnify. If the US Seller has the right
but does not elect to represent the interests of the Acquired Companies under
this Section9.8, Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of the
Acquired Companies in such Tax Contest with reasonable costs of such control
being borne by US

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-74-  

  

 

  Seller, provided that Buyer shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any
Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the US Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. This Section9.8
and not Section12.5 shall govern with respect to Tax Contests.

 

  

  

9.9 Resolution of All Tax Related Disputes. If the US Seller and the Buyer
cannot agree on the calculation of any amount relating to Taxes for which the
US Seller is liable under Section 9.1(a) or Buyer is liable under Section
9.1(b), such dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, whose decision
shall be final and binding upon all persons involved and whose expenses shall
be borne substantially in accordance with Section 2.1(h) by the party that
loses the dispute. If a Tax Return is required by applicable Law to be filed
or a payment made before such accounting firm have resolved the disputed items
(taking into account valid extensions of time within which to file, which
shall be sought to the extent necessary to permit the resolution of disputed
items), the Tax Return shall be filed or payment made as determined by the
Filing Party, and shall be amended if necessary to reflect the determination
of the accounting firm with respect to the disputed items.

  

  

9.10 Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments. All indemnity payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
adjustments to the consideration paid with respect to the Acquired Stock to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

9.11 Assistance and Cooperation. From and after the Closing, each of the
Sellers and the Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
(a) reasonably assist the other Party in preparing and filing any Tax Returns
which such other Party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance
with Section 9.2, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
amount of any Tax for which Sellers, Buyer or their respective Affiliates may
be liable pursuant to this Agreement, provided that no Party shall have any
obligation under this Section 9.11(b) to the extent that such efforts could
reasonably be expected to increase the Taxes of such Party or its Affiliates,
and (c) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any Tax Contest with respect to
the Acquired Companies or the ITO Assets.

  

  

9.12 Tax Reporting with respect to PL Acquired Company. The Parties agree to
treat the acquisition of the PL Acquired Company in accordance with Rev. Rul.
99-6 (Situation 2) for tax purposes. The Parties shall prepare and file all
Tax Returns, reports and financial statements consistent with, and shall not
take any tax position inconsistent with, the foregoing.

  

  

9.13 Conflicts. To the extent any provision of this Article 9 and Article 12
are in conflict with respect to any Tax matters, notwithstanding Article 12,
this Article 9 shall apply (e.g., the provisions of Section9.8 with respect to
Tax Contests shall apply in lieu of the provisions of Section 12.5).

  

  

ARTICLE 10

occurred on or before 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the date that is one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the date hereof (the "End Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to
act has been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Transactions to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

  

  

(c) by either the Buyer or the US Seller, if:

  

  

(i) a Governmental Authority in the United States, the United Kingdom or
Poland shall have enacted, issued or promulgated a Law that has the effect of
rendering the Transactions illegal or unenforceable in the United States, the
United Kingdom or Poland; or

  

  

(ii) a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in the United States,
the United Kingdom or Poland shall have issued an Order prohibiting,
restraining, making illegal or materially altering the Transactions that has

covenant or agreement of the US Seller set forth in this Agreement such that,
if not cured on or prior to the Closing, the conditions set forth in Section
3.3(b) would not be satisfied at the Closing and such breach has not been
cured prior to the earlier of within thirty (30) Business Days after written
notice thereof to the US Seller and the End Date; or

cured prior to the earlier of within thirty (30) Business Days after written
notice thereof to the Buyer and the End Date.

  

  

10.2 Effect of Pre-Closing Termination. In the event of the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Article 10, this
Agreement shall thereupon and forthwith become void and of no further force or
effect whatsoever, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part
of the Buyer, Sellers or their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
connection herewith; provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve
any Party from liability resulting from or arising out of any willful and
intentional material breach of such Party's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth herein; and provided further that the
provisions of this Section10.2 and Article 13 shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement under the terms of
Section10.1, and notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, following
any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, any party
hereto shall remain liable thereafter for any fraud that occurred prior to
such termination.

ARTICLE 12

  

POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

12.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. If the
Closing occurs, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Parties set forth in this Agreement, and the right to make indemnification
claims under this Agreement in respect of such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements, shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
(a) with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Article 4
and/or Article 5, other than the Excluded Representations, until the earlier

financial statements for the Acquired Companies for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2016 and (y) August 31, 2016, (b) with respect to the Excluded
Representations, until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations (or extensions thereof) applicable to the matters set forth

31, 2016 and (c) with respect to each of the covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement, until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the

shall deliver a Claim Certificate to an Indemnifying Party setting forth a
claim for indemnification under this Article 12 in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of a Party set forth in this
Agreement prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, then such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall continue in full force
and effect solely with respect to such claim until the final resolution
thereof.

  

  

12.2 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in this Article 12 and
Article 9 (as applicable with respect to Tax matters), from and after the
Closing, the Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnitees for:

  

  

(i) any and all damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, deficiencies,
penalties, fines, Taxes, costs or other expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) (collectively, "Losses") paid, sustained or
incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee as a result of or arising out of:

  

  

(A) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Sellers in this Agreement (as qualified by the Seller Disclosure Schedule to
the extent provided in this Agreement), in each case, as of the date of this
Agreement or as of the Closing Date (or if a representation or warranty
addresses matters only as of a specified date, such date), or in the US Seller
Closing Certificate, limited, with respect to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-77-  

  

 

  indemnification claims arising out of a breach of Sections 4.7(a), (b),
(c), (d), (k), (l), (m), (n) or (o) (Taxes), to Losses in respect of Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period imposed on any of the Acquired Companies as a
result of such breach;

Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees for:

  

  

(i) any and all Losses paid, sustained or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee as
a result of or arising out of:

  

  

(A) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Buyer
in this Agreement, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the

(B) any breach by the Buyer of any of its covenants or other agreements set

(c) Except in the event of fraud, a dispute under Section 2.1 (which shall be
governed exclusively by Section 2.1), or as provided in Article 9 (which shall
be governed exclusively by Article 9) or Sections 8.3(b), 8.3(c), 8.4(b) or
8.4(c), but without limiting any rights or obligations of the Parties pursuant
to any document, deed or agreement delivered pursuant to Section 3.2, from and
after Closing, the rights of the Buyer and the Sellers to indemnification
under this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies of the Parties for money
damages with respect to any matter in any way relating to, or arising out of,

Representatives, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misstatement or
omission respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the US Seller or the Buyer set forth or
contained in this Agreement, the US Seller Closing Certificate or the Buyer
Closing Certificate.

12.2(a), and the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
under Section 12.2(b), for any Indemnification Claims made after the

make claims for indemnification under Section 12.2(a), and the Seller
Indemnitees may only make claims for indemnification under Section 12.2(b),
prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the Transactions are
consummated, each of the Parties acknowledge and agree that all applicable
statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims
thereunder shall be shortened to the applicable Survival Period.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 12.2(a)(i)(A) for any Losses that the Buyer Indemnitees are otherwise
entitled to be indemnified against thereunder arising out of a single set of
(or series of related) facts and circumstances that are less than $25,000 (the
"Single Claim Threshold"); provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any
claim with respect to Excluded Representations or fraud and, for the avoidance
of doubt, if the Single Claim Threshold is exceeded then the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be entitled to indemnification with respect thereto for the entire
amount of the Loss without regard to the Single Claim Threshold; and

  

  

(ii) the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 12.2(b)(i)(A) for any Losses that the Seller Indemnitees are otherwise
entitled to be indemnified against thereunder arising out of a single set of
(or series of related) facts and circumstances that are less than Single Claim
Threshold; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim with
respect to Excluded Representations or fraud and, for the avoidance of doubt,
if the Single Claim Threshold is exceeded the Seller Indemnitees shall be
entitled to indemnification with respect thereto for the entire amount of the
Loss without regard to the Single Claim Threshold.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 12.2(a)(i)(A) for Losses that the Buyer Indemnitees are otherwise
entitled to be indemnified against thereunder unless and until the amount of
such Losses exceed one-half percent (0.5%) of the Final Adjusted Closing
Purchase Price (the "Deductible Amount") in the aggregate, whereupon the Buyer
Indemnitees shall only be entitled to indemnification under Section 12.2(a)(i)
for such Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to any claim with respect to Excluded
Representations or fraud; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-79-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 12.2(b)(i)(A) for Losses that the Seller Indemnitees are otherwise
entitled to be indemnified against thereunder unless and until the amount of
such Losses exceed the Deductible Amount in the aggregate, whereupon the
Seller Indemnitees shall only be entitled to indemnification under Section
12.2(b)(i)(A) for the amount of such Losses in excess of the Deductible
Amount; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim with respect
to Excluded Representations or fraud.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) (A) the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be entitled to indemnification under Section 12.2(a)(i)(A) shall be
limited to five percent (5%) of the Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price in
the aggregate (the "Cap"), and (B) the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for
which the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under
Section 12.2(b)(i)(A) shall be limited to the Cap; provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to any claim with respect to Excluded
Representations or fraud; and

  

  

(ii) (A) the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
(including Article 9 and this Article 12), collectively, shall be limited to
an amount equal to the Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price in the aggregate,
and (B) the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which the Seller
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
(including Article 9 and this Article 12), collectively, shall be limited to
an amount equal to the Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price in the aggregate,
in each case including any claims with respect to fraud.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) the amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under this
Agreement (including Article 9 and this Article 12) shall be reduced by the
amount of insurance proceeds, indemnification payments and other third party
recoveries (net of all collection related costs and expenses, retentions,
deductibles and/or increases in premiums related thereto) actually received by
an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses incurred by such Indemnified
Party and any net Tax benefits actually realized within two (2) years of the
date of the Loss giving rise thereto, limited in the case of the Buyer
Indemnitees with respect to such net Tax benefits to those benefits received
by or with respect to the US Acquired Company;

  

  

(ii) the Losses for which indemnification is available under this Agreement
(including Article 9 and this Article 12) shall not include, and no
Indemnified Party may bring or recover any indemnification claims arising out
of, any punitive damages or damages determined based on a multiple of any
financial or business measure (including revenues, earnings, sales or other
benchmarks) unless and solely to the extent that such damages are payable by
an Indemnified Party to a third Person pursuant to an Order; and

  

  

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent required by applicable Law,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses after becoming
aware of any event which may give rise to any Losses in respect of which the
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
(including Article 9 and this Article 12).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-80-  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that a single set (or series of related) facts and circumstances
entitles an Indemnified Party to indemnification under more than one section
or subsection of Section 12.2(a) or Section 12.2(b), as the case may be, such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the Losses arising out of that
set (or series of related) facts and circumstances only once under this
Agreement.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under Article 9 or
this Article 12 for any Losses to the extent such Losses were included as
Current Liabilities, Closing Indebtedness or Seller Transaction Expenses in
the Final Adjusted Closing Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.1 or are
Severance Expenses or Separation Costs (the treatment of which, for the
avoidance of doubt, is governed by Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.4(a),
respectively; provided, however, that this Section 12.3(g) shall in no way
limit the Buyer Indemnitees' rights with respect to indemnification in
connection with any breach of Section 2.3 and/or Section 2.4.

  

  

(h) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in the second sentence of Section 4.6(a) and the first
sentence of Section 4.6(b)) and the amount of Losses that are the subject
matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder, and for determining whether
the Single Claim Threshold and/or Deductible Amount have been met, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement and the schedules and exhibits
hereto (other than the representations and warranties set forth in the second
sentence of Section 4.6(a) and the first sentence of Section 4.6(b)) shall be
read without regard and without giving effect to the terms "material", "Seller
Material Adverse Effect" or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or similar phrases
contained in such representation or warranty (as if such words were deleted
from such representation and warranty).

  

  

12.4 Indemnification Claims.

  

  

(a) If an Indemnified Party reasonably believes that it has or will have a
right to indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnification Claim"),
such Indemnified Party shall so notify the Indemnifying Party in a written
notice (a "Claim Certificate"), prior to the expiration of the Survival Period
(if applicable): (i) stating that such Indemnified Party has directly or
indirectly paid, sustained or incurred any Losses or had any Losses asserted
against it, or reasonably anticipates that it will directly or indirectly pay,
sustain or incur any Losses or have any Losses asserted against it, for which
it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement; (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so
stated (and the method of computation of each such item of Losses, if
applicable), the date each such item of Losses was paid, sustained or incurred
or asserted against it, or the basis for such reasonably anticipated Losses;
(iii) a brief description in reasonable detail (to the extent available to
such Indemnified Party) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to
each item of Losses based on such Indemnified Party's good faith belief
thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant (if
any) and copies of any formal demand or complaint relating thereto (if any);
and (iv) the basis for indemnification under this Agreement to which such item
of Losses is related (including, if applicable, the specific nature of the
misrepresentation, or the breach of warranty or covenant).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-81-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall seek to contest any
individual items of Losses set forth in a Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying
Party shall so notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days
after receipt of such Claim Certificate, which notice shall set forth a brief
description in reasonable detail of the Indemnifying Party's basis for
objecting to each item of Loss. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall
fail to object to any items of Loss set forth in a Claim Certificate within
the foregoing thirty-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have irrevocably agreed and consented to indemnify the Indemnified Party in
respect of such items of Loss pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any Losses set forth in a
Claim Certificate and in otherwise resolving such matters, such assistance and
cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such
matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

  

  

12.5 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) In the event any Action is instituted or threatened against an Indemnified
Party that involves or appears reasonably likely to involve an Indemnification
Claim hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall, promptly
after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the Indemnifying Party of
the commencement thereof. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party of
the commencement of any such Action will relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability in connection therewith only if and to the extent that such failure
materially and adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying Parties to
defend its interests in such Action.

  

  

(b) Upon receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party and subject to
delivery (within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice from the
Indemnified Party) of written notice to the Indemnified Party that
unequivocally acknowledges the Indemnifying Party's liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Action, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, in its sole discretion, and at its sole cost and expense, to
assume control of the defense of such Action; provided, however, that:

  

  

(i) if the Indemnifying Party properly assumes control of the defense of such
Action, the Indemnified Party (at its sole cost and expense) shall have the
right to participate in (but not control) the defense of such Action and shall
not have the right to settle such Action for so long as the Indemnifying Party
is controlling such defense pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.5;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-82-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not unreasonably be
withheld, delayed or conditioned; and

  

  

(iii) if the Indemnifying Party is eligible to and does assume the defense of
such Action such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if
in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, an actual
conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that
prevents joint representation; provided, further, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any single such Action.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party within the fifteen (15) day period described
above does not properly elect to defend against such Action, or if the
Indemnifying Party is not entitled to otherwise do so, the Indemnified Party
may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party has delivered written
notice to the Indemnified Party unequivocally acknowledging the Indemnifying
Party's liability to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Action:

  

  

(i) the Indemnifying Party (at its sole cost and expense) shall have the right
to participate in (but not control) the defense of such Action; and

  

  

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall not settle any Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not unreasonably be
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding Section 12.5(b) above, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to control (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified
Party) such Action and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by
the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have
sole control over, the defense or settlement of such Action in the event (i)
such Action primarily seeks an injunction or other equitable relief in respect
of the Indemnified Party and/or its business, (ii) such Action relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, Action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (iii) upon petition by the
Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Action in good
faith, (iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the Loss relating
to such Action could exceed the maximum amount that such Indemnified Party
could then be entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of Article
12 or (v) such Action involves any supplier or customer of the Business.

13.3 Amendments and Waivers. Subject to applicable Law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Closing if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each of the Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom
the waiver is to be effective. No course of dealing and no failure or delay on
the part of any party hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-85-  

  

 

  conferred by this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise
prejudice such party's rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of the
parties to this Agreement to require the performance of a term or obligation
under this Agreement or the waiver by any of the parties to this Agreement of
any breach hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or
obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single
or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy.

 

  

  

13.4 Expenses. Except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein, whether
or not the Transactions are consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall
be the obligation of the respective Party incurring such fees and expenses.
Without limitation of the foregoing, US Seller and its Subsidiaries (other
than the Acquired Companies) shall be responsible for any Seller Transaction
Expenses, and notwithstanding anything in Article 1 to the contrary, such
Seller Transaction Expenses shall not constitute Assumed Liabilities of the
Acquired Companies.

  

  

13.5 Confidentiality. The Buyer and the US Seller acknowledge and agree that
the existence of this Agreement (including Seller Disclosure Schedule) and the
other Transaction Agreements, and the terms and conditions hereof and thereof,
shall constitute "Evaluation Material" under and within the meaning of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2013 by and between US
Seller and Charlesbank Equity Fund VII, Limited Partnership (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

13.6 Public Statements. Except as required by Law, neither the Buyer nor the
US Seller shall (and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to), without the prior
written consent of the other, directly or indirectly make or issue any
statement or other communication to the public or any third party regarding
the subject matter of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements, or the terms and conditions hereof or thereof, including, if
applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, or any
disputes or arbitration proceedings hereunder or thereunder.

  

  

13.7 Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements and other provisions
set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of either Party shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs and permitted assigns
of such party, whether or not so expressed. Neither Party may assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent in writing of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and
after the Closing, the Buyer shall have the right to assign all or certain
provisions of this Agreement, or any interest herein, and may delegate any
right, duty or obligation hereunder, without the consent of any Seller, to (i)
any Affiliate of the Buyer, (ii) any purchaser of any or all of the assets or
equity interests (whether by merger, recapitalization, reorganization or
otherwise) of the Buyer or the Business, or (iii) to any of the Buyer's
financing sources as collateral.

  

  

13.8 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any
reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of any
such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof
shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-86-  

  

 

  to any party), it being intended that each Parties' rights and privileges
shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and
any such invalidity, illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction (so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party).

 

  

  

13.9 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions (without proof of damages), specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent actual or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
and the Parties hereby agree to waive any requirements for posting a bond or
other security in connection with any such action. Each Party agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any aware of an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity.

  

  

13.10 Other Remedies. Except to the extent set forth otherwise herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  

  

13.11 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as specifically set forth or
referred to herein, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument
or agreement executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the
