ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.01_, and subject to the Company having complied with its
obligations set forth in _Section 1.02(b)_, Merger Sub shall, and Acquiror
shall cause Merger Sub to, on or before the date that is ten (10) Business
Days after the date of the execution of this Agreement, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer.

 

(b) The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Acquiror to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver
(if permitted by _Section 1.01(c)_ below) of the conditions set forth in
_Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ ") and are not subject to any other
conditions (without limiting the right of Merger Sub to terminate, extend or
modify the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement). On the terms
and subject to the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and Acquiror shall
cause Merger Sub to, (x) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and
(y) accept and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Tendered Shares_ ") as soon as practicable
after the Expiration Date (as defined below) and in compliance with applicable
Law (as defined below). The acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to and
subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date and time at which the Offer Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Acceptance Time_." Acquiror
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on the date of
the Offer Closing all funds necessary to purchase and pay for any and all
Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase
pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement.

 



2 (c) The Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition) are for the sole
benefit of Acquiror and Merger Sub, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Acquiror and Merger Sub may waive, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition at any time and from
time to time, in their sole and absolute discretion, other than the Minimum
Condition, which may be waived by Acquiror and Merger Sub only with the prior
written consent of the Company. Acquiror and Merger Sub expressly reserve the
right to waive, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any of the Offer
Conditions, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ that, unless otherwise provided
in this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing, Acquiror
and Merger Sub shall not: (i) subject to _Section 3.07_, decrease the Offer
Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease
the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) impose
conditions on the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions or amend any Offer
Condition in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares, (iv) waive or
amend the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any other term of the Offer in a
manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares, (vi) extend or otherwise
change the Expiration Date (as defined below) except as required or permitted
by _Section 1.01(e)_, or (vii) provide a "subsequent offering period" within
the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(d) On the date the Offer is commenced, Merger Sub shall, and Acquiror shall
cause Merger Sub to, file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which Tender Offer Statement shall include an offer to purchase,
letter of transmittal, summary advertisement and other required ancillary
offer documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made, together with any exhibits, supplements
or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by applicable Law. Subject to _Section 6.02_, the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion of the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender all of their Shares
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") in the Offer
Documents. Merger Sub shall, and Acquiror shall cause Merger Sub to, cause
the Offer Documents and the filing and dissemination thereof to comply in all
material respects with the requirements of applicable Law. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Acquiror and Merger Sub all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Shares that may be required to be set forth in the
Offer Documents or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section 1.01(d)_, including communication of the Offer
to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Each of the parties agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and Acquiror and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps

the extent required by applicable Law. Acquiror and Merger Sub shall provide
the Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments (and shall
orally describe any oral comments) that Acquiror, Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing
of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with
the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Acquiror and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Acquiror and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by the Company.
Acquiror and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly
to any such SEC comments.

 



3 (e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the
Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the
20th business day (for purposes of this _Section 1.01(e)_ calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that
the Offer is commenced (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the period
of time for which the Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and
in accordance with, this _Section 1.01(e)_ or as may be required by
applicable Law, the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the

then-effective Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions shall not have
been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, Merger Sub shall,
and Acquiror shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for successive
periods of not more than twenty (20) Business Days per extension (as defined

such longer period as the parties may agree, in order to permit the
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions (it being understood, for the avoidance
of doubt, that the Offer shall not be extended pursuant to this  _clause (i)_
if all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement), and (ii) Merger Sub shall, and Acquiror shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for any period required by any applicable Law, rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or rules of the

_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , Merger Sub shall not in any event be required to,
and without the Companys prior written consent shall not, extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date (as defined below). Nothing in this _Section 1.01(e)_
shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the
right of the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to the terms hereof, Merger Sub shall, and Acquiror shall cause
Merger Sub to, promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day of such

Recommendation (as defined below), the fairness opinions of the Companys
financial advisor referenced in _Section 4.20_ and the notice and other

extent required by applicable Law, including by setting the Stockholder List

shall cause the Schedule 14D-9, the filing and the dissemination to comply in
all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law. Acquiror and
Merger Sub shall as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof furnish to the Company all information concerning Acquiror and Merger

in the Schedule 14D-9.

 



4  Each of the parties agrees to promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall
provide Acquiror, Merger Sub and their counsel in writing with any written
comments (and shall orally describe any oral comments) that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. Prior to the

such SEC comments.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement provide to

Shares as well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories,
in each case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date and
shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such additional information and
assistance (including updated lists of the record and beneficial holders of
Shares, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or
its agents may reasonably request in order to communicate the Offer to the
holders of Shares (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom
the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the "
_Stockholder List Date_ "). Except as required by applicable Law, and except
as necessary to communicate regarding the Offer and the Merger with the
holders of Shares, Acquiror and Merger Sub (and their respective
representatives) shall hold in confidence the information contained in any
such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is
terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such
information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in the

6 ARTICLE III

 

CONSIDERATION; PAYMENT FOR SHARES, OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

 

Section 3.01 _Conversion of Shares; Cancellation of Treasury Shares and
Acquiror-Owned Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Acquiror, Merger Sub,
any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of Acquiror or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) Shares held in the treasury of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) Dissenting Shares (as defined below), which
Dissenting Shares shall have only those rights set forth in _Section 3.08_)
(the Shares described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Acquiror, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, be
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive in cash an amount
per Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the Offer Price
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the Certificates (as
defined below) or Book-Entry Shares (as defined below), or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof, representing such Shares, as applicable, in accordance with
this _Article III_. At the Effective Time all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (in each case representing
such Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. Each Excluded
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Acquiror, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to
exist at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

Section 3.02 _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Acquiror, Merger Sub or the holders
thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into and become one (1) share of
common stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation, and such shares
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock in the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 3.03 _Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Acquiror will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company designated by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to make the aggregate payments of
the Merger Consideration due pursuant to _Section 3.01_ (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in the
preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund may be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed

 



7  by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that (x) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement, (y) following any such
losses that result in the amount of funds in the Payment Fund being
insufficient to promptly pay the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration
that remains unpaid, Acquiror shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent to the extent of such insufficiency, and (z) such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in any
combination of the foregoing. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall be paid solely to Acquiror. The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, was the record holder of Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 3.01_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_") in exchange for the
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together
with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other documents as may
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares (or Shares represented by any such affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person (as defined below)
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.03_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing
any Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes solely the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, Book-Entry
Shares or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, without any interest thereon.

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby.

 



8 (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares who have not complied with this
_Section 3.03_ prior to the end of such six (6) month period shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. None
of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such
Shares or otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time become the property of Acquiror, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof.

Section 3.04 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this _Article III_.

Section 3.05 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) Subject to _Section 3.05(f)_, at the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, without any further action on the
part of any holder of a Company Option, be assumed by Acquiror. Each such
Company Option so assumed by Acquiror hereunder (an " _Adjusted Option_ ")
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
(including the term, exercisability and vesting schedule as were applicable to
the corresponding Company Option immediately before the Effective Time,
except that (i) Acquirors board of directors or a committee thereof shall
succeed as to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to any Adjusted Option; (ii) each Adjusted
Option will be exercisable for that number of shares of Class A common stock
of the Acquiror (" _Acquiror Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of the number of shares of Common Stock to
which the corresponding Company Option related immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and (iii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Adjusted Option will be equal to the quotient of the per share
exercise price of the Company Option divided by the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The date of grant of each
Adjusted Option will be the date on which the corresponding Company Option
was granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment described in this
_Section 3.05(a)_ shall be

 



9  made on a grant-by-grant basis in a manner consistent with Section 409A of
the Code and, with respect to each Company Option that is an incentive stock
option (within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code), no adjustment will
be made that would be a modification (within the meaning of Section 424(h) of
the Code) to such Company Option.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested,
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder of a Restricted
Stock Unit, be assumed by Acquiror. Each such Restricted Stock Unit so assumed
by Acquiror hereunder (an " _Adjusted RSU_ ") shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions, including vesting, forfeiture and
payment provisions, as were applicable to the corresponding Restricted Stock
Unit immediately before the Effective Time, except that (i) such Adjusted RSU
will be converted into the right to receive a number of whole shares of
Acquiror Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the number
of shares of Common Stock to which the Restricted Stock Unit related
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio and (ii) Acquirors board of directors or a committee thereof
shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to any Adjusted RSU. For the avoidance of
doubt, the adjustment described in this _Section 3.05(b)_ shall be made on a
grant-by-grant basis.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 3.05(g)_, at the Effective Time, each Restricted
Stock Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder of a Restricted
Stock Award, be assumed by Acquiror. Each such Restricted Stock Award so
assumed by Acquiror hereunder (an " _Adjusted RSA_ ") shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including vesting and
forfeiture provisions, as were applicable to the corresponding Restricted
Stock Award immediately before the Effective Time, except that (i) such
Adjusted RSA will be converted into the right to retain a number of whole
shares of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Restricted Stock Award
related immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio and (ii) Acquirors board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board
or any committee thereof with respect to any Adjusted RSA. For the avoidance
of doubt, the adjustment described in this _Section 3.05(c)_ shall be made on
a grant-by-grant basis.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ "
means the quotient of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the average
closing price for a share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not
reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the five (5)
consecutive trading days ending with the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest
one ten thousandth.

 



10 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, and in any
event prior to the Initial Expiration Date, the Company Board (or a committee
duly authorized by the Company Board for such purpose) shall (i) adopt any
resolutions as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this _Section
3.05_, (ii) if requested by Acquiror, adopt any resolutions as may be
necessary to terminate any or all of the Company Stock Plans, effective as of
the Effective Time, and (iii) if determined by Acquiror in good faith to be
necessary to effectuate the treatment set forth herein, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent of any holder of a Company
Option, Restricted Stock Unit or Restricted Stock Award to the treatment set
forth herein; _provided_ , that the Company shall provide Acquiror with a
reasonable opportunity to review any resolutions or other documents in respect
of the actions described in this _Section 3.05(e)_ and will implement any
reasonable comments that are timely provided by Acquiror in respect thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 3.05(a)_ to the contrary, with
respect to each Company Option that is (i) outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) held by any person who was an
employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, but whose
employment or service as a consultant with the Company or such Subsidiary
terminated prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Former Service Provider_
"), Acquiror reserves the right to determine, no later than twelve (12)
Business Days prior to the projected Closing Date (or such later date as
agreed between the Company and Acquiror), that, at the Effective Time, each
and every Company Option held by each and every Former Service Provider (each,
a " _Non-Assumed Option_ ") shall be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), a
cash payment from Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, equal to the product
of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share of such Non-Assumed Option, multiplied by (y) the number of Shares
covered by such Non-Assumed Option (the aggregate amount of such cash, the "
_Option Consideration_ "), with payment subject to applicable Tax withholding
and paid without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that
the exercise price per Share of any Non-Assumed Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration (each, an " _Underwater Option_ "), at the
Effective Time, each such Underwater Option will be cancelled and extinguished
and the holder of such Underwater Option will not receive any
payment therefor.

(g) Notwithstanding Section 3.05(c), with respect to each Restricted Stock
Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a non-employee director (the " _Director RSAs_ "), immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each such Director RSA, whether or not vested, shall
vest and, shall be cancelled and shall at the Effective Time, each such
Director RSA shall be cancelled and be converted automatically into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (in lieu of any right to receive an
Adjusted RSA), less any applicable taxes. As of the Effective Time,
each holder of Director RSAs, shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(h) Promptly following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall (i) prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 and, if unavailable as
to any Adjusted Options, Adjusted RSUs or Adjusted RSAs, another form of
registration statement available therefor (or shall otherwise maintain the
effectiveness of an existing registration statement on Form S-8 previously
filed by Acquiror and, if applicable, such other appropriate form of
registration statement) with respect to those shares of Acquiror Common Stock
issuable upon vesting, exercisability and/or settlement, as applicable, of the
Adjusted Options, Adjusted RSUs, and Adjusted RSAs, and (ii) exercise
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements for so long as such Acquiror Common Stock
remains outstanding.

 



11 Section 3.06 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Company, Acquiror, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise, such amounts as are required to be withheld under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. Each of the Company, Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or
eliminate any such withholding including by requesting any appropriate Tax
forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as
applicable, or any similar information, from the Company stockholders.

 

Section 3.07 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, during the
period between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the number of
outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different number of Shares or a
different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be
proportionately and equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such
change; _provided_ , that in any case, nothing in this _Section 3.07_ shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

Section 3.08 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who are entitled to
demand and are properly demanding appraisal rights pursuant to, and who are
complying in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall
be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due to the holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
Corporation Law, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under
Section 262 of the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in
accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right
to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and
become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal shall have been
irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance

wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) held in the treasury of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or (iii) as to which dissenters rights have been perfected) pursuant to this

complete copy of such opinion will promptly be made available to Acquiror for
informational purposes only (it being agreed that none of Acquiror or Merger
Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have any

"independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act) (i) at a meeting duly called and held at
which all members of the compensation committee were present, duly and

disclosure of such information in the context of considering Takeover
Proposals, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to or concurrently with the Company taking such actions
as described in _clauses (A)_ and/or _(B)_ above, the Company shall provide
written notice to Acquiror of such determination of the Company Board as
provided for in _clause (ii)_ above, together with (subject to the existing
terms of confidentiality obligations of the Company as in place as of the date
of this Agreement) the identity of the Person or group making such Takeover
Proposal.



 



40 (c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Acquiror in writing in the event that the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or its or their respective Representatives, receives any

group who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any Takeover
Proposal, or any initial request for discussions or negotiations related to

respect thereto, including any material changes to the terms of any such
inquiry, proposal, offer or request. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject to the existing terms of confidentiality obligations
of the Company as in place as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Acquiror
with unredacted copies of all written inquiries, requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements, and oral summaries of any oral
inquiries, requests, proposals or offers, received by the Company, its

relating to a Takeover Proposal, or that the Company, its Subsidiaries, or its
or their respective Representatives delivers to any Person or group making a
Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Acquiror or Merger Sub),

adverse to Acquiror or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation or the
findings or conclusions of the Company Board referred to in Section 4.03(b),
(ii) approve or recommend the adoption of, or publicly propose to approve,
declare the advisability of or recommend the adoption of, any Takeover

(other than any tender or exchange offer relating to securities of the
Company (other than the Offer)) or any material modification thereto is first
made public or sent or given to the stockholders of the Company or received by
the Company, fail to issue a press release publicly (A) reaffirming its
recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, and (B) rejecting
and not recommending such Takeover Proposal within five (5) Business Days (or,
if earlier, prior to the anticipated Expiration Date) following Acquirors
written request to do so (which request may only be made once with respect to
any such Takeover Proposal and each material modification thereto), (vi)
withhold or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Companys stockholders or (vii)
following the commencement of any tender or exchange offer relating to
securities of the Company (other than the Offer), fail to issue a press
release publicly announcing within ten (10) Business Days of such commencement
(A) that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer and
(B) reaffirming its recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer and the
Merger (any action described in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ ,
_(v)_ , _(vi)_ or _(vii)_ being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ").

 



 



41 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal if and only if: (v)
the Company has complied with the other provisions of this _Section 6.02_,
(w) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
(x) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the applicable Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it intends to accept or
recommend such Superior Proposal, (y) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to Acquiror, at least four (4) Business Days prior to effecting
any Adverse Recommendation Change, of its intent to take such action,
specifying the reasons therefor and including a copy of the
proposed acquisition agreement and any other documents related to such
Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Intended Recommendation Change_ "), and (z)
if requested in writing by Acquiror, the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,
after providing any such Notice of Intended Recommendation Change, negotiated
with Acquiror in good faith during the four (4) Business Day period after such
Notice of Intended Recommendation Change to amend the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby such that the
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal and at the end of
such four (4) Business Day period (as it may be extended pursuant to the
following proviso) the Company Board again makes the determinations described
in clauses (w) and (x) with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the event that there is any material amendment to the
terms of any Superior Proposal ( _provided_ , that any revision to the amount,
form or mix of consideration the Companys stockholders would receive as a
result of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be a material amendment),
the Company shall notify Acquiror of such material revision in compliance with
_Section 6.02(c)_ and the period during which the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees and other Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Acquiror
shall be extended until at least three (3) Business Days after the time the
Company provides such notification to Acquiror of any such material revision
and the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change prior to
the end of any such period as so extended; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company Board shall have considered in good faith any amendments to
this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby offered in
writing by Acquiror prior to 8:00 p.m. New York time on the last day of the
applicable period(s) described above and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the failure of the Company Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(g)_ would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



42 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" communication, as defined in Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act and in accordance therewith, pending disclosure of its
position thereunder, and the issuance of any such communication shall not, in
and of itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made unless the Company shall have first complied with its obligations
in _Section 6.02(e)_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section
6.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company Board may, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, if: (i) there
shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a material event,
material development or material change in circumstances that was not known by
the Company or the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and does not
relate to any Takeover Proposal or the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
which event, development or change in circumstance, or any material
consequences thereof, becomes known to the Company Board prior to the
Acceptance Time (any such material event, material development or material
change in circumstances unrelated to a Takeover Proposal being referred to as
an " _Intervening Event_ "); _provided_ , _however_ that in no event shall any
of the following constitute, or be taken into account in determining the
existence of, an Intervening Event: (x) the fact that the Company meets or
exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or
predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for
any period, or changes after the date of this Agreement in the market price
or trading volume of the Common Stock, (y) the reasonably foreseeable
consequences of the announcement of this Agreement, or (z) any event, fact,
circumstance or occurrence or combination or series thereof relating to or
involving Acquiror, including declines in the market price or trading volume
of Acquiror stock; (ii) no director had knowledge, as of the date of this
Agreement, that such Intervening Event was reasonably foreseeable or
reasonably likely to occur or arise after the date of this Agreement; (iii)
the Company provides Acquiror, at least two (2) Business Days prior to any
meeting of the Company Board at which it will consider and determine whether
such Intervening Event may require the Company to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, with a written notice specifying the date and time of
such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting and a reasonably detailed
description of such Intervening Event; (iv) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the exercise of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (v) no Adverse Recommendation Change
has been made for three (3) Business Days after receipt by Acquiror of a
written notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board has
determined that the failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change in
light of such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the exercise of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (vi) during such five (5) Business Day
notice period, if requested by Acquiror, the Company engages in good faith
negotiations with Acquiror to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such
Intervening Event would no longer be inconsistent with the exercise of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (vii) at the time of any Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
taking into account the advice of the Companys independent financial advisor
and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the
exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law in light of such
Intervening Event (taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Acquiror as a result of the negotiations required by
clause (vi) or otherwise).

 



 



43 (h) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Acquiror
or any of its Subsidiaries) providing for (A) any direct or indirect
acquisition, purchase, lease or license, in a single transaction or a series
of related transactions, of (1) twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured by
any of the fair market value thereof, the related revenues applicable to such
assets, or the related net income related to such assets, in each case, as of
the date of such acquisition, purchase, lease or license), or (2) Shares or
any other Company Securities, which together with any other Shares or other
Company Securities beneficially owned by such Person or group, would
represent twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding Shares, (B) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
Person or group beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, twenty percent
(20%) or more of the outstanding Shares, (C) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or group (or
the shareholders of any Person) would beneficially own, directly or
indirectly, twenty percent (20%) or more of the aggregate voting power of the
Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or twenty percent
(20%) or more of the assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Intellectual Property) of the Company, or (D) any reorganization,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, liquidation, dissolution or any
other similar transaction involving the Company, other than, in each case, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ "
means any bona fide, written Takeover Proposal received after the date hereof
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account the legal,
regulatory, financial and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal, and (y) if
consummated, would be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a
financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, in each case taking
into account the consideration, terms, conditions, timing, financing terms
and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover
Proposal (including the Person or group making the Takeover Proposal) and of
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Acquiror pursuant to _Section 6.02(e)_); _provided_ , however that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal" references to "20%" in the
definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such Takeover Proposal shall not be deemed
to be a "Superior Proposal" if any financing required to consummate the
transaction contemplated by such Takeover Proposal is not committed or, in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board, is not reasonably capable of
being obtained by such third party.

 



44 Section 6.03 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement continuing until the
earlier of the valid termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time,
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give Acquiror and Merger Sub and their
authorized officers, employees, accountants, investment bankers, counsel and
other Representatives reasonable access (during regular business hours upon
reasonable notice) to such employees, offices, data centers and other
facilities at reasonable times and to such books, Contracts, commitments and
records (including Tax Returns) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Acquiror or Merger Sub may reasonably request and instruct the Companys (and
its Subsidiaries) independent public accountants to provide access to their
work papers and such other information as Acquiror or Merger Sub may
reasonably request, (ii) furnish Acquiror and Merger Sub with such financial
and operating data and other information with respect to the business,
properties and personnel of the Company as Acquiror or Merger Sub may from
time to time reasonably request, (iii) furnish promptly to Acquiror and Merger
Sub a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to
the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws and (iv) with
respect to the matters set forth on _Section 6.03(a)_ of the Disclosure
Letter, consult with Acquiror with respect to any decisions of a legal nature
related thereto and prior to the Company or its Subsidiaries responding to
any request or submitting any documentation in response thereto, provide
Acquiror a reasonable opportunity to review any such submission, response or
related documentation and provide comments; provided that with respect to
this clause (iv), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to settle
or provide any remedy with regard to any such matters without the prior
written consent of Acquiror, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be obligated to provide such access, inspections, data or other
information to the extent that to do so (A) could reasonably be expected to
jeopardize an attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protection,
or (B) would violate an existing confidentiality obligation to any Person or
any Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of _clause (A)_ and _(B)_
, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents to provide such access,
inspections, data or other information and take such other action (such as
the redaction of identifying or confidential information, entry into a joint
defense agreement or other agreement or by providing such access, inspections,
data or other information solely to outside counsel to avoid the loss of
attorney client privilege) as is necessary to provide such access, data or
other information to Acquiror and Merger Sub in compliance with applicable
Law, and otherwise the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to institute appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements, to the extent practicable in the circumstances. No investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.03 or by Acquiror or its Affiliates shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
made by the Company in this Agreement or the conditions of Acquiror and Merger
Sub related thereto.

 

(b) All information obtained by Acquiror or Merger Sub pursuant to this
_Section 6.03_ shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



45 Section 6.04 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notice and Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
6.04(c)_, each of the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub, shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer
and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the
Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
file within ten (10) Business Days any required submissions under the HSR Act,
and use its reasonable best efforts (A) to furnish information required in
connection with such submissions under the HSR Act (including responding to
any "second request" for additional information or documentary material under
the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable), (B) to obtain early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (C) to keep the other
parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions
under the HSR Act, including with respect to: (1) the receipt of any non-
action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (2) the expiration of
any waiting period, (3) the commencement or proposed or threatened
commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial
action or proceeding under the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended (the " _FTC Act_ "), the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended (the "
_Clayton Act_ "), or the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended (the "
_Sherman Act_ ") and (4) the nature and status of any objections raised or
proposed or threatened to be raised under the HSR Act, the FTC Act, the
Clayton Act or the Sherman Act with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (D) to obtain all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances and approvals
from any Governmental Entity and (ii) the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate with one
another: (A) in promptly determining whether any filings are required to be
or should be made or any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or
should be obtained from other parties to any Contracts or instruments that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or related to the Companys
and its Subsidiaries business in connection with this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) in promptly
making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits, approvals
or waivers. Information shared among the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub
pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ shall be subject to such
confidentiality restrictions as may be reasonably requested, including
limiting information to outside counsel only.

(b) The Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to: (i) promptly notify the others of, and if in
writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication to
such Person from a Governmental Entity and permit the others to review and
discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the
others in relation to) any proposed written communication to a Governmental
Entity (except with respect to Taxes) and (ii) keep the others reasonably
informed of any developments, requests for meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Offer or the Merger. The Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub
agree not to, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, to the extent
not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, participate in any
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transaction unless it
consults with the other party in advance and gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and advisable under
the circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Section
1.01(d)_ and _Section 1.02(a)_, not this _Section 6.04(b)_, shall govern the
matters covered therein.

 



46 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or
be construed to require, Acquiror, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in order to obtain any required
approval from any Governmental Entity or any third party, to: (i)(x) sell,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold
separate pending any such action, or (y) propose, negotiate or offer to
effect, or consent or commit to, any such sale, leasing, licensing, transfer,
disposal, or divestiture, or holding separate, before or after the Acceptance
Time or the Effective Time, of any assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interests therein of (I) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (II) the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
or the (III) Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) accept any conditions
or take any other actions (including amending, modifying, terminating or
entering into any contracts or other business arrangements) that would impose
any restrictions or limitations on the conduct or operation of, or adversely
affect or impact, any business, assets or properties of (I) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (II) the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (III) the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the limitations set forth in this sentence shall not apply,
solely in the case of clauses _(i)(I)_ ,  _(i)(II)_ , _(ii)(I)_ and
_(ii)(II)_ above, to any such sale, lease, license, transfer, disposal,
divestiture, other encumbrance, separate holding or acceptance of any such
condition, restriction or limitation that would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(d) In the event that any Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and such litigation, action or proceeding
seeks to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any written notice
has been delivered or any Legal Proceeding commenced, in each case of the
type described in paragraph (c)(v) of _Annex I_ , each of the Company,
Acquiror and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate
with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such written notice (including by commencing a Legal Proceeding to
declare invalid any purported termination or right to terminate contained in
such written notice) or Legal Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, ruling, award,
settlement or stipulation, or dismissed any appeal, review, rehearing or
reconsideration, that may result from any such Legal Proceeding, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or frustrates the satisfaction of the condition set forth in
paragraph (c)(v) of _Annex I_ , unless, by mutual agreement, Acquiror and
the Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Each party hereto shall keep the other parties hereto reasonably informed, but
only to the extent that doing so would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
party, jeopardize any privilege of the party with respect thereto regarding
any such litigation, action or proceeding, it being agreed that each party
will also cooperate with the other parties to permit such inspection of or to
disclose such information on a basis that does not compromise or waive such
privilege with respect thereto. Each party shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,
cooperate fully with the other parties and their Representatives
in connection with, and shall consult with and permit the other parties and
their Representatives to participate in, the defense of any such litigation,
action or proceeding and each party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives to, give due consideration to
the other parties advice with respect to such litigation, action or
proceeding; provided, however, that each party and its Subsidiaries shall not
be allowed to settle or enter into any negotiations or settlement of any such
litigation, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of the
other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld
or delayed).

 



47 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the other parties and use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ Global Select Market to
cause the delisting of the Shares from the NASDAQ Global Select Market by the
Surviving Corporation as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and
the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

Section 6.05 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Acquiror and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification (and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto)
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger and the Offer), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors and officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ")
as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or such
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the Company
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or under any
Contract between such Indemnified Person and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall
survive the Offer Closing and the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms. From and after the Effective
Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Acquiror shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
advance expenses to, Indemnified Persons with respect to (x) all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the
Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out
of or pertains to the Merger, the Offer, this Agreement and any transactions
contemplated hereby, in either case, to the fullest extent permitted by (i)
the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or such equivalent
organizational or governing documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as
in effect on the date of this Agreement), (ii) any indemnification agreement
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other applicable Contract as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Persons or (iii) applicable
Law. Acquiror shall cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational or governing documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer and employee
liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than those set
forth in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the
Companys Subsidiaries equivalent organizational and governing documents as
of the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Persons. 



 



48 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, at the Companys option, the Company shall,
or, if the Company is unable to, Acquiror shall, cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancelable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as in effect as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Company shall not pay an amount for the DandO Insurance in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance for the policy period that includes the date
of this Agreement. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by either
the Company or the Surviving Corporation prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails
to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) Acquiror will provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnified Persons who are insured

Section 6.06 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Acquiror hereby agrees that, for a period of at least twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the
applicable Continuing Employee), it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) provide each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who continues as of the Effective Time to be employed by
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Acquiror (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with (x) at least the same level of base salary or
hourly wage rate, as the case may be, that was provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) if applicable, an
annual target cash bonus amount that is no less than the annual target cash
bonus amount in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Continuing Employee with
other employee benefits substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding equity and equity-based compensation). In addition, for a period
of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide Continuing Employees
whose employment is terminated by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation (or
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates) with severance benefits in accordance
with such employees individual employment agreement or severance agreement
or, in the absence of any such agreement, in accordance with the severance
policy of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
set forth on _Section 6.06(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter. In addition,
Acquiror hereby agrees that it shall, or shall cause the Surviving

plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation providing benefits to any Continuing Employee following
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Acquiror Benefit Plans_ "), Acquiror
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service rendered by
each Continuing Employee to the Company prior to the Effective Time to be
credited for such purposes to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Continuing Employees be entitled to service credit to the extent such service
credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

 



50 (c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
Acquiror shall (i) cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Acquiror Benefit
Plans to the extent coverage under such Acquiror Benefit Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of
each Acquiror Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee from and after the Effective Time,
(A) cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods
and actively-at-work requirements of such Acquiror Benefit Plan to be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent
such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods or
actively-at-work requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable
Plan and (B) recognize, or cause to be recognized, any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under
a Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be
taken into account under such Acquiror Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Acquiror Benefit Plan.

 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.06_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto,
and that nothing in this _Section 6.06_, whether express or implied, (i)
shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other
Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), (ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Plan or Acquiror Benefit Plan, or (iii) shall limit the right of Acquiror
or its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or Acquiror
Benefit Plan.

applicable to the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub, the Offer or the Merger,
including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board, as
applicable, shall take all action necessary to ensure that the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to
eliminate the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the

or its Affiliates (including, after the Acceptance Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries).

 

Section 6.09 _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable U.S. or
non-U.S. securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) to the extent the content of any

_Section 6.09_, no separate approval shall be required in respect of such
content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent press
release or other announcement, and (b) each party may, without complying with
the foregoing obligations, make any public statement regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby in response to questions from the press,

internal announcements to employees, to the extent that such statements are
not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with this
_Section 6.09_ and do not reveal material nonpublic information regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.09_ shall not
apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the
Company in connection with and related to any Takeover Proposal, Superior
Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change, so long as such release or
announcement is made in compliance with _Section 6.02_ and (y) this _Section
6.09_ shall not apply to any disclosure of information concerning this
Agreement in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use

promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which

Board shall have determined is an "independent director" within the meaning
of the applicable NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent director" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act

the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall be
construed to permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(a) Each of the Company and Acquiror shall promptly notify the other of (i)
any written notice received by such party (or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives) from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Offer or the Merger, if the failure

affect, impede or impair the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (ii)
any Legal Proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened in
writing against, the Company or Acquiror or any of their respective

the following, notify Acquiror of (i) any inaccuracy of any representation or

Subsidiaries) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in each case
if and only to the extent that such inaccuracy, or such failure, would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
Acquiror and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
set forth in _paragraph (c)(iii)_ , _paragraph (c)(iv)_ or _paragraph (c)(v)_
of _Annex I_ to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the

each case if and only to the extent that such inaccuracy, or such failure,
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of
Acquiror or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the ability of Acquiror and
Merger Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and obligations under
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.12(c)_ shall not affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of Acquiror or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies

Stock Plan to the contrary, in the event that any holder of a Company Option
exercises such Company Option between the Acceptance Time and the Effective

deemed satisfied theretofore solely due to an appeal, review, rehearing or

not resulted in an order reversing or vacating the decision referred to in
clause (B)(2) of paragraph (c)(v) of _Annex I_ as of such date, and all other

Condition), Acquiror and Merger Sub shall waive the condition set forth in

such term in _Section 6.02(h)_, except that all references to "20%" therein
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"; or

 



58 (iv) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
8.01(h)_, then the Company shall pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same-day funds prior to or simultaneously with (and as a condition
to the effectiveness of) such termination.

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be payable only once and not in
duplication even though the Termination Fee may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof. Subject to _Section 8.02_, in the event Acquiror shall
receive the Termination Fee, the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof or any matter
forming the basis for such termination), and neither Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding
against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement,
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis
for such termination. If the Company fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee
when due and payable pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Acquiror commences an action or other proceeding that results
in an award against the Company for such Termination Fee, the Company shall
pay Acquirors costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such action or proceeding, together with
interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub, at any time
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that following the Offer Closing, this
Agreement may not be amended in any manner that causes the Merger
Consideration to differ from the Offer Price, and that no amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver shall be made that would require the
approval of the holders of the Shares under applicable Laws; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no amendment shall be made that affects Acquirors
obligation to consummate the Merger as provided in _Section 2.02_. This
Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by any
other applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (c) waive compliance by any
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement
on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

of doubt, _Section 8.02_, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer and in addition to Merger

Sub shall be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act, pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, if:

 

(a) prior to the Expiration Date, there shall not have been validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn that number of Shares that, when added to the
Shares then owned by Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, would represent one share
more than one half of all Shares then issued and outstanding; _provided_ that
for purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been
satisfied, Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures shall be excluded (such condition in this _clause (a)_ , the "
_Minimum Condition_ ");

 

(b) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer
under the HSR Act shall not have been terminated or shall not have expired
prior to the Expiration Date, in each case, without the imposition of any
condition or requiring a remedy that the Company, Acquiror and/or Merger Sub
is not required to accept or agree to after giving effect to _Section

(c) any of the following events shall exist:

 

(i) (A) there shall be any Law or order, injunction or decree enacted,
enforced, amended, issued, in effect or deemed applicable to the Offer, by
any Governmental Entity (other than the application of the waiting period
provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer or to the Merger), or any Governmental
Entity shall have taken any other action, in each case the effect of which is
to make illegal or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer or the Merger
(or to impose a condition or require a remedy that the Company, Acquiror
and/or Merger Sub is not required to accept or agree to after giving effect
to  _Section 6.04(c)_ of the Agreement) or (B) there shall be pending or
threatened (in writing) any Legal Proceeding by any Governmental Entity that
challenges or seeks to enjoin the Offer or the Merger (or to impose a
condition or require a remedy that the Company, Acquiror and/or Merger Sub is
not required to accept or agree to after giving effect to _Section 6.04(c)_
of the Agreement);

 

(ii) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

 



I-1 (iii) (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth

date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
as of such earlier date) (other than, solely in the case of _Section
4.02(a)_, any _de minimis_  inaccuracies (it being agreed that (I) any
inaccuracy related to the issuance or amount outstanding of any Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed to be a _de minimis_ inaccuracy, and (II) any
inaccuracy (other than as described in clause (I) that would not reasonably
be expected to result in additional cost, expense or liability to Acquiror of
more than $2,500,000 shall be deemed to be a _de minimis_ inaccuracy)), or (B)
any representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement
(other than those listed in the preceding _clause (c)(iii)(A)_ ) shall not be
true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation on any
representation or warranty indicated by the words "Material Adverse Effect,"
"in all material respects," "in any material respect," "material,"
"materially" or words of similar import set forth therein) as of the date of
the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such
date and time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date), except, in the case of this _clause
(c)(iii)(B)_ , where the failure of any such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct has not had a Material Adverse Effect;

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply with in any material
respect the obligations, agreements or covenants required to be performed or
complied with by it under the Agreement on or prior to the Expiration Date;

 

(v) prior to the Expiration Date, (A) (1) NAR or any of its Subsidiaries shall
have delivered to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries written notice
purporting to terminate the Operating Agreement (whether immediately or with
the passage of time), or (2) NAR or any of its Subsidiaries shall have given
the Company written notice of, or there shall have been commenced a Legal
Proceeding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries asserting, or by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, a default or breach (or
alleged default or breach) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
the Operating Agreement permitting the Operating Agreement to be terminated
(whether immediately or with the passage of time) and (B) such notice referred
to in clause "(A)(1)" or such notice or the subject matter of such notice or
Legal Proceeding referred to in clause "(A)(2)"shall not have been (1)
withdrawn on a bona fide basis by NAR and/or its applicable Subsidiaries and
not reinstated, or (2) determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware or by other valid
judicial or arbitral process (which determination has not been reversed or
vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction) to not (I) have been a valid
termination under the Operating Agreement (in the case of clause "(A)(1)")
and/or (II) permit the Operating Agreement to be terminated (in the case of
clause "(A)(2)"), as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that should any such
decision by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, the Supreme Court
of the State of Delaware, or other applicable judicial or arbitral body be
subject to appeal, review, rehearing or reconsideration, then the Offer
Condition contained in this paragraph (c)(v) shall not be deemed satisfied
until any and all applicable periods for the filing of such appeal, review,
rehearing or reconsideration shall have elapsed following such decision or, if
such appeal, review, rehearing or reconsideration is accepted by the
applicable appellate body within such applicable period, then the Offer
Condition contained in this paragraph (c)(v) shall not be deemed satisfied
until the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date (it
being understood that the Offer Condition contained in this paragraph (c)(v)
shall not be deemed satisfied if such appeal has resulted in the decision of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, the Supreme Court of the State
of Delaware or other applicable judicial or arbitral body being reversed or
vacated by such date); or

 



I-2 (vi) Merger Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate of the
Company, executed by the chief executive officer or the chief financial
officer of the Company, dated as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that
the conditions set forth in _paragraphs (c)(iii)_ and _(c)(iv)_ of this _Annex
I_ have been satisfied.

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Acquiror and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Acquiror and Merger Sub (except for the Minimum Condition),
may be asserted by Acquiror or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to any such conditions, and may be waived by Acquiror or Merger
Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole and
absolute discretion (except for the Minimum Condition), in each case, subject
to the terms of the Agreement and applicable Law, including the rules and
regulations of the SEC. The failure by Acquiror or Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this  _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex
I_ shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of September 30, 2014, by and among Move, Inc. (the " _Company_ "),
News Corporation (" _Acquiror_ "), and Magpie Merger Sub, Inc. (" _Merger
Sub_ ") (the " _Agreement_ ").
