Merger   Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, MergerSub
shall be merged (the "MERGER") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION").   (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction and/or, to
the extent permitted by this Agreement, waiver of all conditions to the
Merger, the Company and MergerSub shall file a certificate of merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required
by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time (the "EFFECTIVE TIME") that the certificate of merger
is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at any later time that
may be specified in the certificate of merger).   (c) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights,
powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and MergerSub, all
as provided under Delaware Law.    6    Section 2.02. Conversion of
Shares. At the Effective Time,   (a) except as otherwise provided in Section
2.02(b), Section 2.04 or Section 2.05, each share of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, together with each
preferred share purchase right (each, a "RIGHT") issued pursuant to the
amended and restated Rights Agreement dated as of May 18, 1999 between the
Company and Mellon Investor Services (formerly ChaseMellon Shareholder
Services, LLC), as rights agent (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), shall be
collectively converted into the right to receive $20.55 in cash, without
interest (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION");   (b) each share of Company Common
Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect to any such share; and   (c) each share
of common stock of MergerSub outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.03. Surrender and
Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the purpose
of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES") or (ii) uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock (the "UNCERTIFICATED SHARES"). Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed in order to ensure prompt
payment to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at
the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be
in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company and which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in that
exchange.   (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(ii) receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or any other
evidence, if any, of transfer that the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)
in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company    7   Common Stock represented
by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common
Stock represented thereby.   (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person, other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is
registered, it shall be a condition to that payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or that Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and
(ii) the Person requesting that payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of that payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of that Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 2.   (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration that is payable in respect of those shares in accordance with
this Section 2.03 after that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration that is so payable without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
two years after the Effective Time (or any earlier date, immediately before
that time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any governmental authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled to those amounts.   Section 2.04.
Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to the Merger in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for those shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of those
shares, unless that holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the
right to    8   appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, each share of
Company Common Stock of that Holder shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration that is payable in respect of each such share. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to those demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any of those demands.   Section 2.05. Stock Options. (a) At or
immediately before the Effective Time, each employee stock option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any employee stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION"),
whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be canceled, and Parent shall pay
or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay each holder of any such option
cancelled at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such option an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of $20.55
per share of Company Common Stock over the applicable exercise price of that
option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that holder could
have purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had that holder
exercised that option in full immediately before the Effective Time.   (b)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts (but without the expenditure of any funds) to
(i) obtain any consents from holders of options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company\'s stock option or compensation plans
or arrangements and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of that stock
option or compensation plans or arrangements that, in the case of either
clauses (i) or (ii), are reasonably necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by Section 2.05(a). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section, payment may be withheld in respect of any employee
stock option until those necessary consents are obtained.   Section 2.06.
Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during that period,
the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.   Section 2.07. Withholding
Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Article 2 any amounts that it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of that payment under any   
9   provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
those amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made that
deduction and withholding.   Section 2.08. Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming that Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by that Person of a bond, in any reasonable amount that the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to that Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue,
in exchange for that lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by that Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.  
Article 3  The Surviving Corporation   Section 3.01. Certificate of
Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect at
the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law.   Section
3.02. Bylaws. The bylaws of MergerSub in effect at the Effective Time shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable law.   Section 3.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the
Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
in accordance with applicable law, (i) the directors of MergerSub at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii)
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of

of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities
of other    11   states in which the Company is qualified to do
business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and

SEC Document filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

clause (ii) or (iii) of the definition of "Tax".   (i) "TAX" means (i) any

in the case of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, liability for the
payment of any amount of the type described in clause (i) as a result of

reference to the activities of any other Person, and (iii) liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the payment of any amount as a result
of being party to any tax sharing agreement or with respect to the payment of

result of any existing express or implied agreement or arrangement (including
an indemnification agreement or arrangement). "TAX RETURN" means any report,

investment tax credit, foreign tax credit, charitable deduction or any other

Matters. (a) Schedule 4.18(a) contains a correct and complete list
identifying each material "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), each material employment,
severance or similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy and each other
material plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation,
bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related rights or other
forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance
(including any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits,
employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers\'
compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and
post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension,
health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered
or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate and covers any
current or former employee, director, officer or independent contractor
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability. Copies of
those plans (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements or
insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations
thereof have been made available to Parent together with the most recent
annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto)
prepared in connection with any such plan or trust. Those plans are referred
to collectively in this Agreement as the "EMPLOYEE PLANS".   (b) Neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor to the Knowledge of the Company any
predecessor thereof sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the past
sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA with such exceptions as would not be reasonably expected to have
any material liability for the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates.   (c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor
any predecessor thereof contributes to, or has in the past contributed to,
any multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a
"MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN").   (d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file,
an application for that determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and
the Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter
should be revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to
Parent copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been
maintained in material compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders,    23  rules and regulations,
including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to that Employee Plan with
such exceptions as would not be reasonably expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have any material liability for the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Affiliates. No material events have occurred
with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment
by or against the Company of any material excise taxes under Sections 4972,
4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code with such
exceptions as would not be reasonably expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have any material liability for the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates.   (e) The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(either alone or together with any other event) entitle any
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There
is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or collectively, would entitle any employee or former employee
to any severance or other payment solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or could give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m) of
the Code. Schedule 4.18(e) sets forth, opposite the name of each person
listed in that schedule, the maximum bonus payment to which that person may
be entitled in respect of the Company\'s fiscal year ending May 31, 2004
under the Company\'s CEO Bonus Plan, 2004 Bonus Plan, Long-Term Executive
Bonus Plan and any other bonus plan or arrangement.   (f) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in respect of post-
retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or
current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except as required to
avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or as may be required under
other applicable law.   (g) There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any
of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, an Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining that Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in
respect thereof for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003.   (h) All
contributions and payments accrued under each Employee Plan, determined in
accordance with prior funding and accrual practices, as adjusted to include
proportional accruals for the period ending as of the date of this   
24  Agreement, have been discharged, paid or accrued in accordance with
ordinary Company practice.   (i) There is no action, suit, investigation,
audit or proceeding pending against or involving or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan before any court
or arbitrator or any state, federal or local governmental body, agency or
official with such exceptions as would not be reasonably expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have any material liability for the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates.   (j)
The Company has no material Employee Plan that principally covers non-U.S.
employees.   (k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering
into, any collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding
with a labor union or organization nor, as of the date hereof, is the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding asserting
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor
organization nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor has there been for the past five years, any labor strike,
material dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no campaigns being conducted to
solicit cards from Company employees to authorize representation by an labor
organization or other proposed bargaining unit representative.   (l) Since
January 1, 2000, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has closed
any facility or work site used in the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or effectuated any material employee layoffs or down-sizing or
implemented any early retirement, separation or window program or
announced any such action or program that has triggered any WARN Act
requirements or similar state or foreign labor laws.   Section 4.19.
Environmental Matters. (a) Except as expressly set forth in the Company SEC
Documents or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect:   (i) no notice, notification, demand,
request for information,  citation, summons or order has been received, no
complaint has been filed,  no penalty has been assessed, and no
investigation, action, claim, suit,  proceeding or review (or any basis
therefor) is pending or, to the  Knowledge of the Company, is threatened by
any governmental entity or  other Person relating to or arising out of any
Environmental Law;    25   (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and
have been in  compliance during the past five years with all Environmental
Laws and all  Environmental Permits; and   (iii) there are no liabilities
of or relating to the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,  absolute, determined, determinable
or otherwise arising under or relating  to any Environmental Law.   (b)
There has been no environmental investigation, study, audit, test, review or
other analysis in the possession of the Company that has been prepared in the
past ten years concerning the current or prior business of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any property or facility now or previously owned
or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been
delivered to Parent at least five Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement.   (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns,
leases or operates or has owned, leased or operated any real property, or
conducts or has conducted any operations, in New Jersey or Connecticut, that
in any such case is subject to the environmental transfer acts of either such
state.   (d) For purposes of this Section 4.19, the terms "COMPANY"
and "SUBSIDIARIES" shall include any entity that is deemed by operation of
law to be a corporate predecessor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   Section 4.20. Antitakeover Statutes and Rights Agreement.
(a) The Company has taken all action necessary to exempt the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from Section
203 of Delaware Law, and, accordingly, neither such Section nor any other
anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation (each, a "TAKEOVER STATUTE")
applies or purports to apply to any of those transactions. No other "control
share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover laws or
regulations enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The
Company has amended the Rights Agreement to provide that Parent shall not be
deemed an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) and that the
Rights will not separate from the shares of Company Common Stock or become
exercisable solely as a result of entering into this Agreement,
or consummation of the Merger and/or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company has taken all other action necessary to render
the rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement inapplicable
to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  
Section 4.21. Intellectual Property. (a) Schedule 4.21(a)(i) contains a true
and complete list of patents, registered copyrights, registered
trademarks,    26  registered service marks, Internet domain name
registrations and any applications for registrations for any of the foregoing
included in the Owned Intellectual Property Rights (collectively, the
"COMPANY REGISTERED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS"), specifying as to each
such Intellectual Property Right, as applicable, (i) the owner of such
Intellectual Property Right, (ii) the jurisdictions by or in which such
Intellectual Property Right has been issued or registered or in which an
application for such issuance or registration has been filed and (iii) the
registration or application numbers thereof. Schedule 4.21(a)(ii) contains a
true and complete list of all pending inter-parties proceedings or actions
before any court, tribunal (including the United States Patent and Trademark
Office ("PTO") or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) involving the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and Company Registered Intellectual
Property Rights, specifying as to each, the Company Registered Intellectual
Property Right at issue, the name of the counterparty, the jurisdiction, the
filing date and the status. Neither the Company nor a Subsidiary of the
Company incorrectly has claimed "small business status" in application for
any U.S. patents which are Company Registered Intellectual Property
Rights.   (b) The Licensed Intellectual Property Rights and the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights together constitute all of the Intellectual
Property Rights necessary to conduct the business of the Company and any
Subsidiary of the Company as currently conducted by the Company or the
Subsidiary of the Company except, individually or in the aggregate, as would
not be reasonably expected to have an Material Adverse Effect. All material
Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights are owned exclusively by the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not alter, impair or extinguish any of
Company\'s or the Company\'s Subsidiaries\' rights, as of the date hereof, in
material Owned Intellectual Property Rights or material Licensed Intellectual
Property Rights.   (c) All of the material Company Registered Intellectual
Property Rights are valid and enforceable.   (d) There are no contracts,
licenses or agreements between the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company and
any other Person wherein or whereby the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company has agreed to, or assumed, any obligation or duty to warrant,
indemnify, reimburse, hold harmless, guaranty or otherwise assume or incur
any obligation or liability in connection with any Intellectual
Property Right that could, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 4.21(d) lists all pending warranty claims
asserted in writing by any Third Party against the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company that would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (e) Neither the Company nor a
Subsidiary of the Company has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Intellectual Property Right of    27  any Third Party
except, individually or in the aggregate, as would not be reasonably expected
to have an Material Adverse Effect. There is no claim, action, suit or
proceeding asserted, or to the Knowledge of the Company threatened in
writing, against the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (i) based upon,
or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict, the rights of the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company in any of the material Owned Intellectual Property
Rights, the Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights or the material
Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) alleging that the use by the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company of the material Owned
Intellectual Property Rights, the Company Registered Intellectual Property
Rights or the material Licensed Intellectual Property Rights does or may
misappropriate, infringe or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Right
of any Third Party or breach any obligation owed to a Third Party with
respect to such party\'s Intellectual Property Rights or (iii) alleging on or
after April 26, 2001 that the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
Right of any Third Party. Neither the Company nor a Subsidiary of the Company
has received any written offer on or after April 26, 2001 for a license of
Intellectual Property Rights, including, but not limited to, patent rights,
from any Third Party in connection with a written allegation by such Third
Party giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of suit that the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company has misappropriated or infringed any of the
Intellectual Property Rights of such Third Party.   (f) To the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no reasonable basis (including any prior use,
application or registration) that would prevent the Company from obtaining
trademark registrations for each of the VANS, SWITCH, PRO-TEC, OFF THE WALL,
VANS OFF THE WALL and TRIPLE CROWN, marks in International Classes 9, 18, 25,
28, 35 and 41 (or corresponding national classes) for footwear, clothing,
equipment and accessories as reasonably required to conduct its business
materially as currently conducted in each of the United States, Canada, the
European Union, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, People\'s Republic
of China, Chile, Russia, Australia and New Zealand.   (g) The Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company holds its rights to the material Owned Intellectual
Property Rights and the material Licensed Intellectual Property Rights free
and clear of any Lien, other than restrictions contained in agreements for
the Licensed Intellectual Property Rights. The Company and all of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries have taken actions reasonably necessary to maintain
and protect all material Intellectual Property Rights and Company Registered
Intellectual Property Rights, including payment of applicable maintenance
fees and filing of applicable statements of use.   (h) To the Knowledge of
the Company, within three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement, no
Person has infringed, misappropriated, breached or otherwise violated any
Owned Intellectual Property Right or Licensed Intellectual   
28  Property Rights (other than nonexclusively Licensed Intellectual
Property Rights) except, individually or in the aggregate, as would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (i) The Company
and all of the Company\'s Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps in
accordance with normal industry practice to maintain the confidentiality of
(i) all of the Company\'s and Company\'s Subsidiaries\' confidential
information and trade secrets (ii) information received from Third Parties
which the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is obligated to treat as
confidential. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
material Intellectual Property Rights of the Company or of a Subsidiary of
the Company, the value of which to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
is contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof, has been
disclosed other than pursuant to written confidentiality agreements.   (j)
The Company and all of the Company\'s Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
steps in accordance with normal industry practice to secure from all parties
who have created any material portion of the Owned Intellectual
Property Rights valid and enforceable written assignments of any such work or
other rights to the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company has,
and enforces, a policy requiring each employee who contributes to the
development of the Company\'s Intellectual Property Rights to execute
proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment agreements
substantially in the form of the Company\'s standard forms.   (k) Except,
individually or in the aggregate, as would not be reasonably expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect no (i) product, technology, service or publication
provided to the public by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
material published or distributed to the public by the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) conduct or statement of the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company directed to the public, constitutes obscene
material, a defamatory statement or false advertising.   Section 4.22.
Properties. The Company and its Subsidiaries have sufficient title to all
their tangible properties and assets to conduct their respective businesses
as currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted, with only such
exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are
not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule
4.22(a) correctly describes by common address all real property owned by the
Company or any Subsidiary, and such real property is owned free and clear of
all Liens, except for Liens disclosed in the Company SEC Documents and
Permitted Liens. Schedule 4.22(b)(1) contains a correct and complete list of
all properties in which the Company or a Subsidiary holds a leasehold or sub-
leasehold estate in, or is granted the right to use or occupy, any land,
buildings, improvements, fixtures or other interest in real property
(collectively, the "LEASES"). The Company has made available to Parent true
and complete copies of the Leases listed in    29  Schedule 4.22(b)(2).
All Leases are in full force and effect and have not been further modified or
amended, and there exists no default under any such Lease by the Company or
any such Subsidiary, nor any event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default under any such Lease by the Company or any such
Subsidiary, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None
of the Leases permit the landlord under any such Lease to terminate that
Lease at will and, in connection with that termination, require the tenant
under that Lease to pay any termination fee, accelerated rent or other
similar charge.   Section 4.23. Insurance.   (a) Attached as Schedule 4.23
to this Agreement is a list of all material insurance policies, fidelity
bonds and self-insurance arrangements relating to the assets, business,
operations, employees, officers or directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) all premiums
payable under all such policies and bonds have been timely paid in
all material respects and the Company and the Subsidiaries have otherwise
complied in all material respects with the terms and conditions of all of
those policies and bonds, and (ii) such policies and bonds provide sufficient
coverage for all normal risks incident to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets.   (b) There is no
material claim by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any of
those policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed by the underwriters of those policies or bonds or in respect of
which those underwriters have reserved their rights.   Section 4.24.
Transactions with Affiliates. Except as expressly disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered
into any transaction with any director, officer or other "affiliate" (as
defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (each, a "COMPANY AFFILIATE") or any transaction that
would be subject to proxy statement disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K. Schedule 4.24 sets forth a complete list of each contract,
agreement or arrangement to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party
or bound with any Company Affiliate.   ARTICLE 5  REPRESENTATIONS AND

Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors,
agents or other intermediaries, may (i) subject to the Company\'s compliance

that such action is likely to be required in order for its directors to
comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable law. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from
complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal.   (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of
the actions referred to in Sections 6.03(b)(i) through (b)(iv) unless the
Company shall have delivered to Parent, no later than substantially
contemporaneously with the taking of that action, a written notice advising
Parent that it is taking (or intends to take) that action, and the Company
shall continue to keep Parent reasonably current with any developments after
taking that action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly
(but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of
its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than such components of such businesses, properties or
assets that are generally accessible to the public) by any Third Party that
has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide that notice
orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the
material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication
or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all material respects,
on a prompt basis, of the status and material details of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the advisors, employees and other agents of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third
Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any such party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of
confidential information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf
of the Company to return or destroy all of that information.   (d)
"SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company   
36  Common Stock on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after considering the advice of its outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking into
account all of the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation, is (i) reasonably likely to be consummated and (ii) would,
if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to all of the
Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than as provided
hereunder and for which financing, to the extent required, is then fully
committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors
of the Company.   Section 6.04. Tax Matters. (a) From the date hereof until
the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
make or change any Tax election, change any annual tax accounting period,
adopt or change any method of tax accounting, file any amended Tax Returns or
claims for Tax refunds, enter into any closing agreement, surrender any Tax
claim, audit or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, offset
or other reduction in Tax liability surrendered, consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or
take or omit to take any other action, if any such action or omission,
considered in the aggregate, would have the effect of materially increasing
the Tax liability or reducing any Tax Asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish
or cause to be established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective
Time an adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to any period ending
prior to or as of the Effective Time.   (c) All transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger
(including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid
by the Company when due, and the Company shall, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all of those
Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns
and other documentation.   Section 6.05. Intellectual Property Rights. (a)
Except as may be consented to in writing by Parent, after the date of this
Agreement and before the Effective Time:   (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries will make payments and take  such other actions as are
reasonably necessary to maintain material  Company Registered Intellectual
Property Rights, including the payment of  any registration, maintenance or
renewal fees or the filing of any  responses to office actions by the patent,
copyright, trademark or other  authorities in the United States or foreign
jurisdictions, documents,    37   applications or certificates for the
purposes of obtaining, maintaining,  perfecting or preserving or renewing
such material Company Registered  Intellectual Property Rights, provided that
the Company shall not be  obligated to do so in any instance in which the
Company deems such action  unnecessary or inadvisable in its reasonable
business judgment not  inconsistent with past practices;   (ii) the Company
and its Subsidiaries will provide information to  Parent upon the Parent\'s
reasonable written request about the status of  any pending applications for
material Company Registered Intellectual  Property Rights and, subject to
compliance with any anti-trust or other  legal requirements, allow Parent to
provide instruction and direction as  to the prosecution of such applications
in a timely manner so as not to  hinder or unduly delay or inconvenience the
Company\'s prosecution  activities; and   (iii) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries will license  or will commit to license any of the
material Owned Intellectual Property  Rights or the material Licensed
Intellectual Property Rights, except in  the ordinary course of business not
inconsistent with past practices.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will provide Parent with a list of actions that to the Knowledge of
the Company (but for the avoidance of doubt excluding knowledge merely of
outside counsel or other third person representatives of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) must be taken by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
within sixty (60) calendar days immediately following the Effective Time,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the
filing of any responses to PTO office actions, documents, applications or
certificates, for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting,
preserving or renewing any Company Registered Intellectual Property
Rights.   (c) For purposes of Sections 4.21 and 6.05, each trademark
(viewing all rights therein and registrations and applications for
registration therefor in the aggregate and taken as a whole in each of the
United States, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, Japan, South Korea,
Switzerland, People\'s Republic of China, Chile, Russia, Australia and New
Zealand) identified in the following list shall be deemed "material": VANS,
SWITCH, PRO-TEC, OFF THE WALL, VANS OFF THE WALL and TRIPLE CROWN.  
ARTICLE 7  COVENANTS OF PARENT   Parent agrees that:    38   Section
7.01. Obligations of MergerSub. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause MergerSub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement.   Section 7.02. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its
Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.   Section 7.03. Indemnification; Directors\' and
Officers\' Insurance. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:   (a) From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless any Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or
who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") from and
against, and defend any Indemnified Person from and reimburse any Indemnified
Person for, (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys\' fees), fines,
liabilities and judgments and amounts that are paid in settlement arising out
of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(A) to the extent based on, or arising out of, the fact that such Person is
or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pertaining to any action or omission existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time or (B) to the extent based on, or arising out of, or
pertaining to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) without limitation to clause (i), but only to the extent based on,
arising out of, or pertaining to, the matters described in the immediately
preceding clauses (A) and (B), to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware
Law or any other applicable laws or provided under the Company\'s certificate
of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement, or any
applicable indemnification agreement or other document providing for
indemnification in existence on the date of this Agreement; provided that
such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to
time under applicable law. The Surviving Corporation will, and the Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) of each
Indemnified Person incurred in defending against or investigating any such
claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding with respect to which such
Indemnified Person is seeking indemnification hereunder promptly after being
invoiced therefor (subject to having received an undertaking from such
Indemnified Person to reimburse such expenses if it is subsequently
determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification
under applicable law).    39   (b) Parent shall be jointly and severally
liable with the Surviving Corporation for the performance of the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligations under this Section 7.03.   (c) Upon receipt by
an Indemnified Person of actual notice of a claim, action or proceeding
against such Indemnified Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Section 7.03, such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify
the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto. In addition, an Indemnified
Person shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation after any action is
commenced (by way of service with a summons or other legal process giving
information as to the nature and basis of the claim) against such Indemnified
Person. In any event, failure so to notify the Surviving Corporation shall
not relieve the Surviving Corporation or Parent from any liability which the
Surviving Corporation or Parent may have on account of this indemnity
or otherwise, except to the extent the Surviving Corporation shall have
been materially prejudiced by such failure. The Surviving Corporation may, at
its election (such election to be made within 30 days of receipt of the
summons or other legal process referred to above), and, if requested by an
Indemnified Person, shall (within 30 days of receipt of a request thereto),
assume the defense of and control any litigation or proceeding in respect of
which indemnity may be sought hereunder, including the employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and the payment of
the fees and expenses of such counsel, in which event, except as provided
below, the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for the fees and
expenses of any other counsel retained by an Indemnified Person in connection
with such litigation or proceeding. The Indemnified Person may assume the
defense of and control any such litigation or proceeding if within the
applicable period specified in the immediately preceding sentence the
Surviving Corporation shall not assume the defense of such matter. In the
case of any proceeding or litigation the defense and control of which the
Indemnified Person shall have assumed in accordance with this Section
7.03(c), (i) the Indemnified Party may retain its own counsel, (ii) the
Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable and documented fees and expenses
of such counsel promptly after receipt of any invoices with respect thereto
(subject to having received an undertaking from such Indemnified Person to
reimburse such expenses if it is subsequently determined that the Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law), and (iii)
the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable efforts to assist in the
defense of any such matter. In any such litigation or proceeding the defense
of which the Surviving Corporation shall have so assumed, any Indemnified
Person shall have the right to participate in (but not control) such
litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person,
unless representation of both parties by the same counsel would, in the good
faith opinion of outside counsel to the Surviving Corporation, be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the
Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Person (in which case the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of separate counsel   
40  for that Indemnified Person shall also be borne and paid by the
Surviving Corporation). In any litigation or proceeding of which the
Surviving Corporation shall have assumed the defense in which equitable
relief or criminal penalties are sought, the Surviving Corporation shall not
settle such matter without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and no
Indemnified Person shall be required to agree to settle such matter unless
such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Person from all liability arising out of or in connection with such matter,
(y) does not include any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act
by, or on behalf of, such Indemnified Person or payment of any money by such
Indemnified Person and (z) does not result in the imposition against such
Indemnified Person of injunctive or other equitable relief. The Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or
proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Surviving Corporation agrees
to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment to the extent that such Indemnified
Person is entitled to such indemnification under this Section 7.03; provided
that, if the Surviving Corporation shall not have assumed the defense of any
litigation or proceeding, the Indemnified Person may settle any such
litigation or proceeding with the consent of the Surviving Corporation (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), in which case the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for such settlement and promptly
indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any liability by reason of
such settlement.   (d) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide officers\' and directors\' liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company\'s officers\'
and directors\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of that policy in effect on the date
of this Agreement (to the extent that those terms are reasonably available in
the directors\' and officers\' insurance market at that time); provided that,
in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.03, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium amount in
excess of the aggregate amount set forth in Schedule 7.03(d).   (e) If
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of that consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.03.    41  
(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights to indemnification and exculpation of
personal liability that such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other
applicable laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her personal
representatives.   Section 7.04. Delisting and Deregistration. The Surviving
Corporation shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Company Common Stock to be no longer quoted on the NASDAQ and deregistered
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time.   Section 7.05. Employee Matters. (a) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
effective on and after the Effective Time, to honor and assume and agree to
perform the obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the
Employee Plans and all employment, severance, termination, change of control,
consulting and collective bargaining agreements to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party, in each case, to the extent the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries would have been required to perform such plan or agreement.  
(b) Parent agrees that, for at least one year following the Effective Time,
subject to applicable law, Parent will provide, or cause to be provided, to
the individuals who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time (the "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES") benefits materially no
less favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such employees or, at the election of Parent,
materially no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided
from time to time to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than any stock option or other equity based incentive
plan currently provided by the Company) and Parent shall cause to be provided
to any Transferred Employee who is terminated during the one-year period
following the Effective Time, severance benefits no less favorable than those
described in Schedule 4.18(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall otherwise limit Parent\'s right to amend, modify or terminate any
Employee Plan.   (c) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will receive service credit for all periods of employment with
the Company and its Subsidiaries or any predecessors thereto prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of participation eligibility and vesting under
any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates in which such employee
participates after the Effective Time to the extent that such service was
recognized under any analogous Employee Plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in effect   42  immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
not for other purposes, including, but not limited to, benefit accruals,
benefit determinations or eligibility for early retirement or special
separation programs).   (d) For purposes of each new or existing employee
benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, Parent or its Affiliates shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such new or existing employee
benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived for such employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent such exclusions were not
applicable or requirements were waived under the corresponding Employee Plan,
and Parent or its Affiliates shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Employee Plan ending on the date such employee\'s
participation in the corresponding new or existing employee benefit plan of
Parent or its Affiliates begins to be taken into account under such new or
existing employee benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and/or his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such new or existing employee benefit plan.   (e) Nothing in this
Section 7.05 will be or be deemed to be for the benefit of or enforceable by,
any person who is not a party hereto, including, without limitation, any
employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates or shall be deemed to limit the Surviving Corporation\'s or its
Affiliates\' ability to modify or eliminate any Employee Plan.   ARTICLE
8  COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY   The parties to this Agreement
agree that:   Section 8.01. All Commercially Reasonable Efforts. (a) Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent

advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Entity or other third
party all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any Governmental Entity or other third party that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this   43  Agreement; provided that for these purposes, all commercially
reasonable efforts of any of the Company, Parent and/or MergerSub shall not
be deemed to include (i) entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent
decree, stipulation or agreement or agreeing to any order regarding antitrust
matters in connection with any objections of any Governmental Entity to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) divesting or otherwise
holding separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking
any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with
respect to any material portion of its and/or its Subsidiaries\' (or the
Surviving Corporation\'s) business, assets or properties.   (b) In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days
of the date of this Agreement and supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable.   Section 8.02. Certain Filings. (a) The Company
and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the
preparation of the Company Proxy Statement, (ii) in determining whether any
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in
taking those actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith or with the Company Proxy Statement and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers.   (b) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Company Proxy Statement, each time
before that document (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with
the SEC, and reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given to any
comments made by that party and its counsel. Each of Parent and the Company
shall provide the other party and its counsel with (i) any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, that such party or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Company Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.    44   (c)
Before any Merger Communication of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective "participants" (as defined in Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the
1934 Act) is (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the media,
employee, client, customer or other third party or otherwise made accessible
on the website of Parent, the Company or any such participant, as applicable
(whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise),
or (ii) utilized by any officer, senior manager, key employee or advisor of
Parent, the Company or any such participant, as applicable, as a script in
discussions or meetings with any such third parties, Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, shall (or shall cause any such participant to) provide
the other such party and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
any such Merger Communication for purposes of, among other things,
determining whether that communication constitutes "soliciting material" that
is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the 1934 Act,
as applicable. Parent and MergerSub or the Company, as applicable, shall (or
shall cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the other such party or parties and
their counsel on any such Merger Communication. For purposes of the
foregoing, the term "MERGER COMMUNICATION" shall mean, with respect to any
Person, any document or other written communication prepared by or on behalf
of that Person, or any document or other material or information posted or
made accessible on the website of that Person (whether in written, video or
oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), that is related to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if reviewed by a holder of
Company Common Stock, could reasonably be deemed to constitute a
"solicitation" of "proxies" (in each case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the
1934 Act) in favor of the Merger.   Section 8.03. Public Announcements.
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference

concurrently with or within 12 months after that termination, a Third  Party
Acquisition Event occurs.   (ii) A "THIRD PARTY ACQUISITION EVENT" means (A)

to "15%" in the  definition thereof (which shall otherwise remain unchanged)

prior  to the termination of this Agreement would have constituted an
Acquisition  Proposal (again, as so defined) or (B) the entering into by the
Company or  any of its Subsidiaries of a definitive agreement with respect to

against the Company for that amount.   (e) The Company\'s payment of the
Termination Fee and reimbursement of Parent expenses pursuant to this Section
11.04 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, advisors or other representatives with respect to any
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(iv).    53   Section 11.05. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Persons other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns.   (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent of each other party to this Agreement, except that Parent or
MergerSub may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one or more of their Affiliates, the right to enter into the transactions

therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that

other oral or written agreement or other communication).   Section 11.10.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement.   Section 11.11. Severability. If any term, provision,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   Section 11.12.
Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the parties shall be
