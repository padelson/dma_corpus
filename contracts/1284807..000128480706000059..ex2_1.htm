481 Inventory  Adjustment (and response to the Objection by Purchaser, if
applicable), Seller  and its accountants shall have reasonable access to the
work papers of Purchaser  and its accountants (subject to the reviewing
parties executing any necessary  waivers or indemnifications required by
Purchaser's accountants) as well as the  accountants, finance personnel and
other books and records of Purchaser relevant  to the review of the Closing
Working Capital Statement and Section 481 Inventory  Adjustment. If Seller
reasonably determines that the Closing Working Capital  Statement and/or the
Section 481 Inventory Adjustment have not been prepared  in  the manner set
forth in _Section 3.01_  of the  Disclosure Letter for the Closing Working
Capital Statement or _Section  8.06(k)_   for the  Section 481 Inventory
Adjustment, Seller shall inform Purchaser in writing  (an "Objection"),
setting forth a specific description of the basis of the Objection  and the
adjustments to the amount of the Closing Working Capital or change  in  the
Section 481 Inventory Adjustment that Seller believes should be made,  which
Objection must be delivered to Purchaser on or before the last day of  such 
30-day period. Purchaser shall then have thirty (30) days to review and
respond  to the Objection. The parties shall attempt in good faith to reach
an agreement  with respect to any matters in dispute. If the parties are
unable to resolve  all  of their disagreements with respect to the
determination of the foregoing items  within thirty (30) days following the
delivery of Purchaser's response to the  Objection, they shall refer their
remaining differences to a nationally  recognized independent public
accounting firm as mutually agreed to by the  parties (the "CPA Firm"), which
shall, acting as experts and not as arbitrators,  determine in accordance
with this Agreement, and only with respect to the  remaining differences so
submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the  Closing Working Capital
or change in the Section 481 Inventory Adjustment  requires adjustment. Each
party shall submit to the CPA Firm its position with  respect to the
adjustments to the amount of the Closing Working Capital and/or  the change
in the Section 481 Inventory Adjustment, as applicable. The parties  shall
direct the CPA Firm to use its best efforts to render its determination 
within thirty (30) days after such submission. The CPA Firm's determination 
shall be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and Seller. Seller shall pay 
a  portion of the fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm equal to 100%
multiplied  by a fraction the numerator of which is the dollar amount of the
Objections  submitted to the CPA Firm that are resolved in favor of Purchaser
(that being  the difference between the CPA Firm's determination and Seller's
determination)  and the denominator of which is the total amount of
Objections submitted to  the  CPA Firm (that being the sum total by which
Purchaser's determination and  Seller's determination differ from the
determination of the CPA Firm). Purchaser  shall pay that portion of the fees
and disbursements of the CPA Firm that Seller  is not required to pay
hereunder. Purchaser and Seller shall make readily  available to the CPA Firm
all relevant books and records and any work papers  (including those of the
parties' respective accountants (subject to the CPA Firm  executing any such
waivers or indemnifications required by the parties' accountants)) relating
to the Closing Working Capital Statement and all other  items reasonably
requested by the CPA Firm. The "Final Working Capital  Statement" shall be
deemed to be (i) the Closing Working Capital Statement  if no Objection is
delivered by Seller with respect thereto during the  thirty-day period
specified above, or (ii) if an Objection is delivered by  Seller with respect
thereto within  the 30-day period following delivery of the Closing Balance
Sheet by Purchaser  to Seller, the Closing Working Capital Statement, as
adjusted by either (A)  the  agreement of the parties or (B) the CPA Firm;
and the "Final Section 481  Inventory Adjustment" shall be deemed to be (i)
the Section 481 Inventory  Adjustment as determined by Purchaser if no
Objection is delivered by Seller  with respect thereto during the thirty-day
period specified above, or (ii)  if an  Objection is delivered by Seller
with respect thereto within  the 30-day period following delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet by Purchaser  to Seller, the Section 481 Inventory
Adjustment, as adjusted by either (A)  the  agreement of the parties or (B)
the CPA Firm.

 

(b) In  reviewing any Objection, Purchaser and its accountants shall have
access to  the  work papers of Seller and its accountants (subject to the
reviewing party  executing any necessary waivers or indemnifications required
by Seller's  accountants).

 

(c) If  the  Closing Working Capital as reflected on the Final Working
Capital Statement  is  less than the Target Working Capital, then the
Purchase Price will be decreased  by the shortfall in the Closing Working
Capital on a dollar-for-dollar basis  and, within ten (10) Business Days
following the date on which the Closing  Working Capital Statement is deemed
to be the Final Working Capital Statement,  Seller shall make payment in
immediately available funds to Purchaser equal  to  such shortfall. If the
Closing Working Capital as reflected on the Final Working  Capital Statement
is more than the Target Working Capital, then the Purchase  Price will be
increased by such excess of the Closing Working Capital on a  dollar-for-
dollar basis and, within ten (10) Business Days following the date  on 
which the Closing Working Capital Statement is deemed to be the Final
Working  Capital Statement, Purchaser shall make payment in immediately
available funds  to Seller equal to such excess.

 

(d) The  parties agree that any obligations that will be paid by Seller or
its Affiliates  (other than the Company), including any obligations
specifically retained by  Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company)
under the terms of this  Agreement, shall be excluded from the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the Closing  Working Capital Statement and the Final Working
Capital Statement, and shall  therefore be excluded from the determination of
Closing Working  Capital.

defects with respect to said improvements. To the best of Seller's
knowledge,  none of the Owned Property or any current use thereof violates

(b) _Section 4.07(b)_  of the  Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all leases of real  property that will be leased to the
Company or leased by the Company to any  third party (the "Leased Property").
Where the Company is a lessee of Leased  Property, it is or on the Closing
Date will be in possession of the Leased  Property purported to be leased
thereunder (with the exception of any lease  set  forth in _Section 
4.07(b)_   of the  Disclosure Letter which by its own terms provides that
the lease term will  expire before the Closing Date, or which has a term that
runs month-to-month).  Where the Company is a lessor of Leased Property, it
is or on the Closing Date  will be the lessor of the Leased Property
specified therein. Each Leased  Property is leased pursuant to a lease (a
"Lease") that is in full force and  effect and is enforceable against the
Company and, to the best of Seller's  knowledge, the other party or parties
thereto, except as limited (a) by  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar  Law affecting creditors' rights
generally, and (b) by general principles of  equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in equity or at law). Except  as set forth in _Section
4.07(b)_  of the  Disclosure Letter, true and complete copies of each Lease
(including each  amendment, supplement or other modification thereto) have
been made available  to  Purchaser. The Company is not (with or without the
lapse of time or the giving  of notice, or both) in breach or default in any
material respect under any  Lease. To the best of Seller's knowledge, none of
the other parties to any Lease  is (with or without the lapse of time or the
giving of notice, or both) in  breach or default in any material respect
thereunder. The Company has not  received any written notice of the intention
of any party to terminate  prematurely any Lease, whether as a termination
for convenience or for default  of the Company thereunder.

 

(c) Except  as  disclosed as _Section 4.07(c)_  of the  Disclosure Letter,
the Owned Property and Leased Property consists of all real  property owned
or leased by the Company (the Owned Property and Leased Property  will be
referred to collectively herein as the "Real Property").

 

(d) None  of  the Owned Property is subject to a pending condemnation,
expropriation, eminent  domain or similar proceeding and, to the best of
Seller's knowledge, no such  proceeding is pending against the Leased
Property.

 



 

**Section 4.08  Labor Matters.**  Except  as set forth in _Section 4.08_

bargaining  or other labor agreement relating to the Business to which Seller
or the Company  is a party, or by which either is bound; or (ii) employment,
retainer, or  consulting agreement that gives rise to any payment obligation
in excess of  $50,000 thereunder to any of the employees of the Business to
which the Company  is a party, or by which it is bound. Since the date that

any material unfair  labor practice with respect to the Business.

_Section 4.09_  of the  Disclosure Letter, there are no Claims pending or,
to the best of Seller's  knowledge threatened against Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the  Company), relating to the Company or the Business
(i) involving more than  $100,000 in claims or damages, (ii) that could
reasonably result in  equitable relief, or (iii) that questions the legality
of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or any Transaction
Document. To the best of  Seller's knowledge, no Claim set forth in _Section
4.09_  of the  Disclosure Letter, individually or in the aggregate where
such Claims arise  out  of related events or circumstances, would reasonably
be expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company or the
Business. There are no outstanding  judgments, decrees, injunctions, rulings,
awards, decisions, verdicts, writs  or  orders of any nature of any
Governmental Entity (a) against or involving the  Business, the Company or
the Company Assets, which have continuing obligations  that have not been
fully satisfied or (b) to the best knowledge of Seller,  against or involving
any officer or director of the Company that prohibit such  officer or
director from engaging in or continuing any material conduct,  activity or
practice relating to the Business or the Company.

completed and filed on a timely basis all  Returns required to be filed on or

current Taxes not yet due and  payable) on the assets of the Company.

 

(e) _Parachute  Payment_.  Neither  the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, shareholder approval of this  Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  could result, separately or in
the aggregate, in the payment of any amount  that  could, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, constitute  an "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the  Code.

 

(f) _Foreign  Person_.  Neither  Seller nor the Company is a person other
than a United States person within  the  meaning of the Code.

plan, program, policy, practice, agreement or arrangement,  whether written
or oral, formal or informal, including, without limitation,  (i)  each
Employee Welfare Benefit Plan (as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA) or 
Employee Pension Benefit Plan (as defined in section 3(2) of ERISA) , but
not  including any multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37)
or  Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan"), and (ii) other 
employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice, agreement or arrangement, 
whether or not subject to ERISA (and any funding mechanism therefor now in 
effect or required in the future as a result of the transactions
contemplated  by  this Agreement or otherwise) that the Company maintains or
sponsors or to which  it contributes or in which its Employees participate or
have any present or  future right to benefits (individually, each an
"Employee Benefit Plan" and  collectively "Employee Benefit Plans").

 



 

(i) Each  Employee Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract,
or fund)  has  been administered in accordance with its terms and complies
in form and in  operation in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), the Code  and all other Laws.

 

(ii) All  required reports, returns, notices, descriptions and other
documentation  (including Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports,
PBGC-1's, and  Summary Plan Descriptions) have been filed or distributed
correctly and on  a  timely basis with respect to each Employee Benefit
Plan. The requirements of  Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and of
Code Section 4980B have  been met with respect to each Employee Welfare
Benefit Plan.

 

(iii) All  contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary  reduction contributions) which are due have been paid on a timely
basis to  each  Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit
Plan and all  contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing
Date which are  not  yet due have been paid to each such Employee Pension
Benefit Plan or accrued  in  accordance with GAAP. All premiums or other
payments for all periods ending  on  or before the Closing Date have been
paid with respect to each such Employee  Welfare Benefit Plan. With respect
to each Employee Benefit Plan that is an  Employee Pension Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, all premiums due  to  the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been  paid.

 

(iv) Each  Employee Pension Benefit Plan, that is intended to meet the
requirements of  a "qualified plan" under Code Section 401(a) has received a
favorable  determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service upon which
it may rely  to  the effect that the Employee Pension Benefit Plan is
qualified and satisfies  the  requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and
that its related trust is  exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code and to the knowledge  of Seller, there are no facts or circumstances
that could reasonably be expected  to cause the loss of such qualification.

 

(v) Transactions  contemplated hereby will not result in accrued but unused
vacation amounts  becoming payable.

 



 

(b) With  respect to each Employee Benefit Plan:

 



 

(i) No  Employee Benefit Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan has
been  completely or partially terminated or been the subject of a "reportable
event" as that term is defined in Section 403 of ERISA and the regulations 
thereunder. No proceeding by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to 
terminate any such Employee Pension Benefit Plan has been instituted or, to 
the  best knowledge of Seller, threatened, and  the  PBGC has not
threatened any action that would impede the transfer of sponsorship  of the
AHE Pension Plan contemplated by _Section 8.05_.  Neither  the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries has filed a notice of intent to  terminate any
Employee Benefit Plan or adopted any amendment to treat such  plan  as
terminated, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may 
constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or 
the appointment of a trustee to administer such plan.

 

(ii) There  have been no prohibited transactions within the meaning of
Section 406 of  ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan  that have not been exempted under Section 408 of ERISA
or Section 4975  of the Code. No fiduciary has any liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or  any  other failure to act or comply with the requirements
of ERISA, the Code or  any  other applicable Laws in connection with the
administration or investment of  the  assets of any Employee Benefit Plan.
With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan,  no action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation or audit (including  administrative investigations,
audits, proceedings by the U.S. Department of  Labor, the PBGC or the IRS
(other than routine claims for benefits)) is pending  or in progress or, to
the best knowledge of Seller, threatened. Seller has  no  knowledge of any
basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or  investigation. With
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan there  are  no audits or proceedings
initiated pursuant to the Employee Plans Compliance  Resolution System or
similar proceedings pending with the IRS or DOL. No asset  of Company is
subject to a lien arising under Section 412 of the Code or  Section 307 of
ERISA, and none of the Company nor any of its subsidiaries  expects to be
subject to any such lien or is subject to any requirement to  post  security
pursuant to Section 412(f) of the Code.

 

(iii) Neither  Seller nor the Company has incurred, and Seller has no reason
to expect that  the  Company will incur, any liability to the PBGC (other
than PBGC premium payments)  or otherwise under Title IV of ERISA (including
any withdrawal Liability) or  under the Code with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan that is an Employee  Pension Benefit Plan. No Employee Benefit
Plan subject to Section 412 of  the Code has incurred any accumulated funding
deficit.

 



 

(c) The  Company has no obligation to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
any  liability (including withdrawal liability) under any Multiemployer Plan

4.14(a)_  of the  Disclosure Letter.

 

(d) With  respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has provided to
Purchaser  a  true, correct and complete copy (or, to the extent no such
copy exists, an  accurate description) thereof and, to the extent applicable:

amendments thereto;  (ii) any related trust agreement or other funding
instrument; (iii) the most  recent IRS determination or opinion letter, if
applicable; (iv) the most recent  summary plan description and summary of
material modifications; and (v) for  the  three most recent years (A) Forms
5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited  financial statements, and (C)
actuarial valuation reports.

 

(e) Except  as  disclosed in _Section 4.14(e)_  of the  Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,  shareholder approval
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement could (either alone or in combination with  another event)
result in (i) severance pay or any increase in severance pay  upon any
termination of employment after the date of this Agreement,  (ii) any
payment, compensation or benefit becoming due, or increase in the  amount of
any payment, compensation or benefit due, to any Employee;  (iii) the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting or result in any  funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits;  (iv) any
material obligation pursuant to any of the Employee Benefit Plans;  or (v)
any limitation or restriction on the right of the Company to merge,  amend or
terminate any of the Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(f) None  of  Seller, the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any plan,
contract or  commitment, whether legally binding or not, or has announced
(orally or in  writing) an intention, to create any additional employee
benefit or compensation  plans, policies or arrangements applicable to
Employees or, except as may be  required by applicable law, to modify,
suspend or terminate any Employee Benefit  Plan.

 

(g) None  of  the Company or any of its subsidiaries has incurred any
liability or obligation  under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and the regulations  promulgated thereunder (the "WARN
Act"), or any similar state or local law that  remains unsatisfied.

 

(h) Except  as  set forth in _Section 4.14(h)_  of the  Disclosure Letter,
no Employee Benefit Plan provides, and neither the Company  nor any of its
subsidiaries has incurred any current or projected liability  in  respect
of, post-employment health, medical, life insurance or death benefits  for
any current or former employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, 
except as may be required under COBRA, and at the expense of the employee or 
former employee.

and to do, or  cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under Law to  consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement  and the Transaction Documents, including using its Best
Efforts to:

 

(i)  defend against any lawsuits, actions or proceedings, judicial or

Documents or the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including  seeking to have any preliminary injunction, temporary
restraining order, stay  or  other legal restraint or prohibition entered or

parties or any of their Affiliates shall be required to make  any  material
monetary expenditure, commence or be a plaintiff in any litigation,  or 
offer for sale of any portion of the Company Assets or Real Property;  and,

 

(ii)  obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals, to effect all
necessary  registrations, filings and submissions (including, but not limited
to, (i)  filings under the HSR Act and any other submissions requested by the

consents,  approvals, orders, registrations and declarations as may be
required under  the  Laws of any foreign country). Purchaser and Seller
shall each be responsible  for  one half of all fees imposed by any

consents, approvals, orders, registrations and/or  declarations. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of  information, Seller and
Purchaser shall have the right to review in advance,  and  to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information  relating to
the Business or Purchaser and its Affiliates or Seller and its  Affiliates,
as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written 
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in 
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the 
Transaction Documents.

 

(b) Seller  and Purchaser shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the
status of matters  relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby and work  cooperatively in connection with obtaining all
required approvals or consents  of  any Governmental Entity. In that regard,
each party shall without limitation:  (i) promptly notify the other of, and
if in writing, furnish the other with  copies of (or, in the case of material
oral communications, advise the other  of)  any communications from or with
any Governmental Entity with respect to the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents,  (ii)  permit the other to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith  the views of the
other in connection with, any material proposed written (or  any  material
proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Entity, (iii)  not
participate in any meeting with any such Governmental Entity unless it 
consults with the other in advance and to the extent permitted by such 
Governmental Entity gives the other the opportunity to attend and
participate  thereat (to the extent such participation would be appropriate),
(iv) furnish  the other with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and  memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between

the Transaction  Documents, and (v) furnish the other with such necessary
information and  reasonable assistance as Seller and Purchaser may reasonably
request in  connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of  information to any Governmental Entity. Seller and Purchaser
may, as each deems  advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive  material provided to the other under this _Section
6.02(b)(iv)  _as  "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein  shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will  not  be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of  the  recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source  of  their materials (Seller and
Purchaser, as the case may be) or its legal  counsel.

 

(c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.02_  shall 
require, or be construed to require, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to 
agree  to (i) sell, hold, separate, divest, discontinue or limit, before or
after  the  Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interest in any assets
or businesses  of  Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, (ii) any  conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in,
the operations of any  such assets or businesses which, in either case, could
reasonably be expected  to  (x) result in a Material Adverse Effect or (y)
materially and adversely impact  the economic or business benefits to
Purchaser and its direct and indirect  stockholders of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) any  material modification or waiver
of the terms and conditions of this  Agreement.

 

(d) In  the  event the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated as  a  result of Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates refusal to
agree pursuant to  _Section 6.02(c)_,  then as  the exclusive right of
Seller under this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay within  three (3) days to
Seller, Seller's direct, out-of-pocket costs of negotiating,  entering into,
and complying with this Agreement, including all reasonable  payments made by
or due and owing by Seller for external legal counsel and  professional
consultant advice relating hereto; _provided_ ,  that  the payment
obligations of Purchaser under this _Section  6.02(d)_   shall  not exceed
$1,000,000.

 



 

**Section 6.03  No Solicitation of Other Bids.**

 



 

(a) Seller  shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates (including  the Company), or any Representatives of any of the

facilitate or continue inquiries  regarding an Acquisition Proposal, as
defined below, (ii) enter into discussions  or negotiations with, or provide
any information to, any Person concerning  the  possible Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreements or other  instruments (whether or
not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. "Acquisition Proposal" shall

its Affiliates) concerning (A) merger, consolidation,  recapitalization,
share exchange or other business combination transaction  involving the
Company; (B) the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital  stock or other
equity securities of the Company; (C) any stock purchase, that  if 
consummated, would result in any Person (other than Buyer and its
Affiliates)  owning any shares of capital stock or other equity securities of
the Company;  or  (D) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any
significant portion  of  the Company Assets. Seller shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated,  and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company) and all the  Representatives of each of the foregoing to immediately
cease and cause to  be  terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted  heretofore with respect to, or that could lead
to, an Acquisition  Proposal.

 

(b) In  addition to the other obligations under this _Section 6.03_, 
Seller  shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days after
receipt  thereof by Seller or its Representatives) advise Purchaser orally
and in writing  of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with
respect to any  Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which
could reasonably  be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and  conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity  of  the Person making the same.

 

(c) Seller  agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 6.03_  shall  include having such provision specifically enforced
by any court having equity  jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed
that any such breach or  threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to
Purchaser and that money  damages would not provide an adequate remedy to
Purchaser.

 



 

**Section 6.04  Supplements to Disclosure.**  From  time to time prior to
the Closing, Seller will promptly supplement or amend  the  Disclosure
Letter hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which,  if 
existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required  to  be set forth or described in such sections of the Disclosure
Letter. Any  disclosure in any such supplement or amendment shall not be
deemed to have  cured  any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty contained in  this  Agreement, including for purposes of the
indemnification rights contained in  this Agreement or of determining whether
or not the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.02(a)_  have  been
satisfied.

 



 

**Section 6.05  Permissible Activities.**  Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Article 6, nothing in this Agreement  shall be construed or interpreted
to prevent Seller or any Affiliate of Seller,  at any time prior to the close
of business on the Targeted Closing Date, from  (i) paying or making regular
or special dividends or other withdrawals or  distributions of cash or
marketable securities or of any property that is not  necessary for
conducting the present operations of the Business; (ii) making,  accepting or
settling intercompany loans or advances, or (iii) engaging in  any  other
transaction incident to the normal cash management procedures of Seller  and
its Affiliates, including short-term investments in time-deposits, 
certificates of deposit and banker's acceptances made in the ordinary course
of  the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor any
Affiliate  of  Seller shall be permitted to take any of the actions of the
type described  in  this _Section 6.05_  at any  time following the close
of business on the Targeted Closing Date except in  compliance with the other
provisions of this Agreement or the Support Services  Agreement.

 



 

**Section 6.06  Examination of Books and Records; Access to Premises**. 
During  the period prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates  (including the Company) to, give Purchaser and its Affiliates and
financing  sources and the Representatives of each of the foregoing
reasonable access  during normal business hours to all of the Books and
Records, Real Property,  premises, agents, personnel of the Company and
including, but not limited to,  access to the personnel of Seller and its
Affiliates for the purpose of  transitional planning in the following areas:
informational technology, account  procurement, human resources (including
employee benefits and compensation),  and  access to the employees of the
Company for the purpose of conducting interviews;  _provided_ ,  that  such
examinations shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to unreasonably 
disrupt the normal business operations of the Company; and, _provided_
_further_ ,  that  such examinations shall be solely to facilitate
consummation of the transactions  contemplated in this Agreement. Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates  (including the Company) to, furnish
Purchaser during such period with such  information concerning the affairs of
the Company which Purchaser may reasonably  request, so that Purchaser may
have a full opportunity to ascertain such matters  concerning the financial
condition, operations, results of operations, business  or prospects of the
Company as Purchaser may deem necessary or appropriate.  No  investigation
by Purchaser shall obviate any of the representations, warranties,  covenants
or agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, Seller is under no obligation to disclose to Purchaser: (i)  any 
information the disclosure of which is restricted by Contract or Law except 
in  strict compliance with the applicable Contract or Law; and (ii) any
information  as to which the attorney-client privilege is available as
reasonably determined  by Seller. Purchaser acknowledges that any information
being provided to it  or  its Representatives by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives  pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement is subject to _Section 6.02(b)_  and the  terms of that certain
Confidentiality Agreement executed by Purchaser on or  about April 17, 2006
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are  incorporated
herein by reference. If privileged and/or attorney work product  documents or
information, including communications between any party hereto  or  its
Affiliates and any of their respective counsel, are disclosed to any other 
party pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby, then Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree 
that  (i) such disclosure is inadvertent, (ii) such disclosure will not
constitute  a  waiver, in whole or in part, of any privilege or work
product, and (iii) the  receiving party will promptly return to the
disclosing party all copies of  such  documents or information in its
possession or in the possession of its  Affiliates or Representatives.
Additionally, each of Seller and Purchaser agrees  that it and its Affiliates
shall not waive the attorney-client, work product,  or  like privilege of
the other party with respect to any of such documents or  information,
without the other party's prior written consent.

Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller shall,  and shall cause the Company to:

(including the  Company) and the Representatives of any of the foregoing

**ARTICLE  8**

 

**ADDITIONAL  COVENANTS OF PURCHASER AND SELLER**

 



 

**Section 8.01  Press Releases.**  Except  as may be required by Law,
neither Purchaser nor Seller nor any of their  respective Affiliates will
issue any press release or other public communication  relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without  the  prior
consent of the other party hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld.

 



 

**Section 8.02  Included Seller Owned Software.**  Seller  hereby provides
to Purchaser and the Company, effective as of the Closing,  a  limited,
perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable,  non-assignable
(except as set forth below), license (the "License") to use and  modify
(other than during the applicable service periods in the Support Services 
Agreement), for the internal operations of the Company only, the Seller
Owned  Software specifically set forth in _Section 8.02_  of the 
Disclosure Letter (the "Included Seller Owned Software"). The License shall
not  permit Purchaser or Company to use the Included Seller Owned Software,
other  than in and for the Business, or to sell, sublicense or otherwise
assign any  such Included Seller Owned Software except as set forth in this
subsection.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may assign the License
to a purchaser  of all or substantially all of the assets of the Business
after the Closing  Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the assignment
contains a license executed by an authorized Representative  of  the
assignee that contains terms and conditions of use and license that are  at 
least as strict as those contained in this Agreement concerning (i) the
License  and (ii) the warranty disclaimers and indemnification sections
applicable to  the  Included Seller Owned Software. Additionally, the
documents memorializing such  assignment must specifically name Seller as the
owner of all right, title and  interest in the Included Seller Owned Software
and the intended third party  beneficiary of such terms and conditions.

 



 

**Section 8.03  Assignments.**

 



 

(a) From  the  date hereof and after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser
shall use their  Best Efforts to secure all necessary assignments, transfers,
consents,  approvals, authorizations, exemptions and waivers from third
parties required  to  complete and enable Purchaser to obtain the benefit of
the transactions  contemplated hereby. Other than certain master agreements
entered into by Seller  or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Company,
_Section 8.03_  of the  Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete
list of all guarantees provided  by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company) to any third party  of the payment, performance and/or
compliance by the Company of any obligation.  Purchaser shall use its Best
Efforts to promptly provide a guarantor to  substitute and take the place of
Seller or its Affiliate solely with respect  to  those Seller Guarantees set
forth in _Section 8.03_  of the  Disclosure Letter, and shall supply to the
third party banking, financial,  and  other reasonably requested credit
information relating to the proposed  substitute guarantor in reasonably
sufficient detail to enable such third party  to determine that the proposed
substitute guarantor can provide financial  assurances to satisfy such party
that the proposed substitute guarantor is  financially responsible and able
to meet the obligations of the Company under  the Contract or Law; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  under no circumstances shall Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates be obligated  to  pay any monetary amounts (other than the third
party's out-of-pocket costs or  de minimus processing expenses) or agree to
any modifications to the terms  of such guarantees that, taken collectively,
would have an adverse impact on  Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, for
this purpose, the Company) in order  to effect such substitution.

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, to the extent the
assignment of any right  to be  assigned to Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement shall require the consent  of  any other party, failure to secure
such consent will not constitute a breach  of  this Agreement. If any such
consent is not obtained, and with respect to master  agreements referred to
in _Section  8.03(a)_   as to  which Purchaser is not able to obtain
separate agreements on a commercially  reasonable basis, Seller shall, with
any related expenses borne equally between  Purchaser and Seller, cooperate
with Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement  designed to provide for
Purchaser the benefit of any such right or agreement,  including enforcement
of any and all rights of Seller against the other party  to  any contract,
commitment or other similar agreement arising out of the breach  or 
cancellation thereof by such party or otherwise.

 



 

**Section 8.04  Access and Cooperation.**

 



 

(a) After  the  Closing, upon reasonable prior written notice, Purchaser and
Seller shall  furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
respective  Representatives access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior  notice, at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
party, such information  (including records pertinent to the Business and the
Company) and assistance  relating to the Business and the Company as is
reasonably necessary for  financial reporting and accounting purposes, the
preparation and filing of  any  returns, reports or forms or the defense of,
or response required under, or  pursuant to, any lawsuit, action or
proceeding (including any proceeding  involving the Company or Seller and any
environmental matters related to the  Company and the Business); _provided_
,  that,  such access does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business of  Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) or
Seller or its  Affiliates. After the Closing, each of Purchaser and Seller
agrees to deliver  promptly to the other all mail and other documents
received by such party which  relate to any business conducted by such other
party or its Affiliates after  the  Closing. Purchaser and Seller shall also
furnish or cause to be furnished to  each other and their respective
Representatives access, during normal business  hours and upon reasonable
prior notice, at the sole cost and expense of the  requesting party, such
information relating to the Business and the Company  for  any other
reasonable business purpose.

 

(b) Purchaser  and Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, retain
until seven (7)  years after the Closing Date all such records (other than
retention of tax  records governed by _Section 8.06_)  pertinent to the
Company and the Business that are owned by such Person  immediately after the
Closing, except that Purchaser shall, and shall cause  its  Affiliates to,
retain all records pertinent to any pre-Closing  Employment-related
Obligations retained by Seller until the expiration of any  applicable
statute of limitations. Cooperation with respect to Tax matters  shall  be
governed by _Section 8.06_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything else set forth herein to the contrary, in no
event shall Seller or  Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates, be
obligated under this  Agreement to disclose to any other party (i) any
information the disclosure  of  which is restricted by contract or Law
except in strict compliance with the  applicable contract or Law or (ii) any
information as to which the  attorney-client privilege is available.
Purchaser acknowledges that any  information being provided to it or its
Representatives by Seller or any of  its  Affiliates or Representatives
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement  is subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, and Seller  acknowledges that any information
being provided to it or its Representatives  by  Purchaser or any of its
Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this  Agreement is subject
to the provisions of _Section 8.09(b)_.  If  privileged and/or attorney work
product documents or information, including  communications between any party
hereto or its Affiliates and any of their  respective counsel, are disclosed
to any other party pursuant to or in  connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, then  Seller and Purchaser hereby
acknowledge and agree that (i) such disclosure  is  inadvertent, (ii) such
disclosure will not constitute a waiver, in whole or  in  part, of any
privilege or work product, and (iii) the receiving party will  promptly
return to the disclosing party all copies of such documents or  information
in its possession or in the possession of its Affiliates or  Representatives.
Additionally, each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that it  and  its
Affiliates shall not waive the attorney-client, work product, or like 
privilege of the other party with respect to any of such documents or 
information, without the other party's prior written consent.

 

(d) Upon  the  request of Purchaser and at Purchaser's expense, Seller shall
(i) use its Best  Efforts to cause its independent auditors to perform such
work as is required  for the auditor to deliver (to the extent after the
exertion of such Best  Efforts the auditor is professionally able to do so)
to the Securities and  Exchange Commission (the "SEC") an auditor's consent
that is required to be  included in any filing with the SEC that includes or
incorporates by reference  the Financial Statements and (ii) to the extent
Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates conducts or intends to conduct an
offering of securities (and if  the  registration statement, prospectus or
offering memorandum for such offering  includes or incorporates by reference
the Financial Statements), at Purchaser's  expense use its Best Efforts to
cause its independent auditors to perform such  work as is required for the
auditor to (to the extent after the exertion of  such  Best Efforts the
auditor is professionally able to do so) deliver a letter  containing
statements and information of the type ordinarily included in  accountant's
"comfort letters" with respect to the financial statements and  financial
information relating to the Company contained or incorporated by  reference
in any such document relating to any such offering, in the case of  each of
(i) and (ii) above, within the time period reasonably requested by  Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates. In addition, in connection with any SEC  filing
required to be made by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (or any SEC  review
of such filing), Seller shall permit Purchaser and its Representatives  to 
have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance  notice, to the properties, books and records of Seller and its
Affiliates  relating to the Company solely for the purpose of preparing any
such SEC filing  or responding to SEC questions, comments or requests on such
SEC  filing.

 



 

**Section 8.05  Employee Matters.**

 



 

(a) _Comparable  Employment_.  The  parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that, as of the Closing, those Employees  who are employed by the Company
immediately prior to the Closing including  an  Employee on medical,
disability, family or other authorized leave of absence,  but not including
any Employee on layoff, unauthorized leave of absence or  other  leave for
bad behavior, will remain employees of the Company immediately  following
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  and  will
be referred to herein as "Continuing Employees." Purchaser shall provide 
initial terms of employment for such Continuing Employees at salary and wage 
rates that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
such  Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and which
terms  are,  in all other respects, comparable in the aggregate, to those
provided to  similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates. For
a period of  six  months after the Closing, to the extent a Continuing
Employee whose employment  is terminated by Purchaser would have been
eligible for severance benefits  under  Seller's severance plan, Purchaser
will provide severance benefits equivalent to  those that would have been
provided by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  nothing in this _Section
8.05(a)_  shall  require the Company or any of its Affiliates to continue
the employment of  any  Continuing Employee following the Closing Date or to
continue the initial terms  of employment for any period after the Closing
Date or any particular employee  benefit plan after the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Employee  Welfare Benefit Plans_.  Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company or its Affiliates to, sponsor  employee welfare benefit plans for the
benefit of Continuing Employees on and  after the Closing Date. Any such
employee welfare benefit plan will give effect,  in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts  paid by such
Continuing Employees with respect to similar Employee Benefit  Plans  in
which such Continuing Employees participated prior to the Closing Date. 
With  respect to employee welfare benefit plans that provide health, dental,
medical,  life insurance, short-term disability, accidental death and
dismemberment and  other welfare benefits (other than with respect to long-
term disability benefits  and any benefits under an Employee Benefit Plan
that are provided to pre-Closing  retirees), (i) Seller shall retain
responsibility for and continue to pay all  plan expenses and benefits for
each Continuing Employee with respect to claims  incurred by such Continuing
Employees or their covered dependents before the  Closing provided such
claims are submitted for payment within sixty (60) days  after the Closing
Date (including expenses or hospital confinements existing  on  the Closing
Date) and (ii) Seller shall have no responsibility for expenses  and 
benefits relating to claims incurred by Continuing Employees after the
Closing  Date (including for pre-existing conditions) under employee welfare
benefit  plans sponsored by Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing).
Purchaser  shall be responsible for and pay all benefits for each Continuing
Employee  with  respect to claims incurred by such Continuing Employees or
their covered  dependents before the Closing (including expenses or hospital
confinements  existing on the Closing Date) to the extent such claims are
submitted for  payment after December 31, 2006. All responsibilities,
obligations,  liabilities and commitments retained by Seller pursuant to
clause (i) of the  preceding sentence shall be considered Excluded
Liabilities for purposes of  this  Agreement.

 

(c) _Service  Credit_.  Purchaser shall cause the Continuing Employees to be
given full credit for  all  service with Seller, the Company or an Affiliate
prior to the Closing Date  for  all purposes (other than benefit accrual
under a defined benefit pension plan)  under any Employee Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employees participate  from and after the Closing Date
to the same extent such service was recognized  by Seller, the Company or an
Affiliate immediately prior to the Closing  Date.

 

(d) _Defined  Contribution Plans_.  Immediately prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall take, or cause to be taken,  all such actions as may be
necessary to cause the Company to cease to be a  participating employer under
Seller's defined contribution plans (the "Seller DC  Plans") covering the
Continuing Employees. Effective as of January 1, 2007,  Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall have in effect one or more defined  contribution plans (the
"Purchaser DC Plans"), which shall be intended to be  qualified under Section
401(a) and other applicable provisions of the Code.  Each Continuing Employee
(other than each Continuing Employee who, as of the  Closing Date, is
eligible for retirement from Seller and, as such, will be  considered
"retired" for purposes of the Seller DC Plans (the "Retiree Eligible 
Employees")) participating in any Seller DC Plans immediately prior to the 
Closing Date shall become a participant in a Purchaser DC Plan as of  January
1, 2007. At such time that is reasonably requested by Purchaser,  Seller
shall cause the trustees of the Seller DC Plans to transfer, but no  later 
than December 31, 2006, in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code, the 
full account balances of the Continuing Employees (excluding any account 
balances of the Retiree Eligible Employees) under the Seller DC Plans to the 
appropriate trustees as designated by Purchaser under the trust agreements 
forming parts of the Purchaser DC Plans. Such transfer shall include and
give  effect to outstanding loan balances under the Seller DC Plans as of the
Closing  Date. Seller shall make all necessary amendments to the Seller DC
Plans and  their related trust agreements to provide for the transfer of
assets described  in this _Section  8.05(d)_ ,  and  Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate to make all filings with applicable  government authorities
required with respect to such transfer, including without  limitation any IRS
Form 5310-A filings and to effect the transfer contemplated  by this
_Section  8.05(d)_.  Except  as expressly provided in this _Section
8.05(d)_,  all  liabilities, obligations and commitments associated with the
Seller DC Plans  that arise out of or relate to the period prior to the
Closing shall remain  liabilities of Seller on and after the Closing Date and
shall be considered  Excluded Liabilities for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(e) _Defined  Benefit Plans_.  Seller  shall cause the sponsorship of the
Alcoa Home Exteriors, Inc. Pension Plan  (the "AHE Pension Plan") and its
related trust, the Stolle Corporation Excess Pension  Plan (the "Excess
Plan") and all obligations under contracts with service  providers or third
party administrators that relate to such plans to be  transferred to Alcoa
Inc. immediately prior to the Closing. As of the Closing  Date, and without
further action by the Company or Purchaser, all employees  and  officers of
the Company with positions of responsibility or duties in respect  of  the
AHE Pension Plan or the Excess Plan, shall be removed from such positions. 
Seller shall not make any amendments to the AHE Pension Plan or the Excess 
Plan,  or any plan into which either such plan is merged following the
Closing, that  will adversely effect the rights of the Continuing Employees
with respect to  their benefits under the AHE Pension Plan or the Excess
Plan, as applicable,  except as required by law or  applied in a uniform
manner to other similar situated employees or retirees  of  Seller. All
obligations and liabilities arising out of or related to the AHE  Pension
Plan and the Excess Plan shall be considered Excluded Liabilities for  all
purposes under this Agreement.

 

(f) _Workers '  Compensation_.  On and  after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall be responsible for all obligations  for  workers' compensation and
other similar statutory claims asserted by or with  respect to Continuing
Employees with respect to work-related injury or other  compensable event or
occupational illness or disease which occurred or is  attributable to any
event, state of facts or condition which existed or occurred  in whole on or
after the Closing Date. Seller shall retain obligations for  workers'
compensation and other similar statutory claims asserted by or with  respect
to Continuing Employees with respect to any work-related injury or  other 
compensable event or occupational illness or disease which occurred or is 
attributable to any event, state of facts or condition which existed or
occurred  in whole on or prior to the Closing Date. If any such injury or
other  compensable event or occupational illness or disease of a Continuing
Employee  who is employed by Seller before the Closing Date and by Purchaser
on or after  the Closing Date is attributable in part to causes occurring
during the period  of time for which Seller has retained obligations under
this paragraph and  in  part to causes occurring during the period of time
for which Purchaser has  assumed obligation under this paragraph and is the
basis of a workers' compensation or other similar statutory claim, the
liability for any such claims  shall be shared by Seller and Purchaser in the
proportion of the periods of  exposure as would be taken into account under
the applicable provisions of  the  statute or labor code applicable to the
injury, occupational illness or disease  of such Continuing Employee. All
liabilities and obligations retained by Seller  pursuant to this _Section
8.05(f)_  shall be  considered Excluded Liabilities for all purposes under
this  Agreement.

 

(g) _Vacation  Accruals_.  As of  the Closing, Purchaser shall assume all
liabilities of Seller or the Company  with respect to the Continuing

performance of the Business for calendar year 2006. Seller shall be 
responsible to pay benefits under the Alcoa Home Exteriors Variable

HIP, MIP, IC and  SMIP to the extent that performance of the Business exceeds
one hundred percent  (100%) of target as of September 30, 2006, and shall
annualize such performance  and pay out benefits based on such performance
within thirty (30) business  days  after Closing. In the event that any

purposes under this  Agreement.

obligations and commitments in respect  of long-term disability benefits to
Continuing Employees on and after the  Closing Date.

 

(l) _Retiree  Health and Life Benefits_.  From  and after the Closing Date,

retain, all liabilities and obligations in respect  of  post-retirement
medical, health and life insurance benefits to all Employees  who  are
retired as of the Closing Date, including all Retiree Eligible Employees, 
or  who retire within one year following the Closing Date; _provided_ , 
that  Seller shall not make any changes or modifications to any such Employee
Benefit  Plan that adversely affect the rights of any Employees thereunder,
unless such  changes or modifications are required by applicable law or
applied in a uniform  manner to other similarly situated retirees of Seller.
All liabilities and  obligations retained by Seller pursuant to this _Section
8.05(l)_  shall be  considered Excluded Liabilities for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(m) _COBRA_.  Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume all
obligations,  Liabilities and commitments in respect of providing notices and
making available  the health care continuation coverage required by COBRA for

and with respect to all  Employees who are not Continuing Employees and who
become eligible for such  coverage at any time after the Closing Date, Seller
shall retain all  obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect of such
Employees under  COBRA, and such obligations, liabilities and commitments
shall be considered  Excluded Liabilities for all purposes of this Agreement.

Agreement to the contrary, Seller  and/or Alcoa shall retain all liabilities,
obligations and commitments under,  arising out of or relating to the Alcoa
Transfer and Relocation Policy, the  Alcoa Relocation Plan and any other
employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement  that provides benefits to
Employees in connection with their relocation,  including, without
limitation, the Transfer Policy, New Hire Policy and  Experienced New Hire
Policy (the "Relocation Arrangements"), and neither the  Company nor
Purchaser shall have any obligation to reimburse Seller, Alcoa  or  any
Employee for any amounts paid pursuant to any Relocation Arrangement, 
including, without limitation, amounts relating to the four individuals
named  on  _Section  4.13(a)(xi)_   of the  Disclosure Letter or any
other Employee who becomes eligible to receive benefits  under any Relocation
Arrangement before the Closing Date (the "Relocated  Employees"). Seller
and/or Alcoa agrees to pay, on or prior to the Closing Date,  to each
Relocated Employee all amounts due to such Relocated Employee pursuant  to
the Relocation Arrangements. All liabilities, obligations and commitments 
retained by Seller or Alcoa pursuant to this _Section  8.05(n)_   shall be

Agreements  listed in _Section 4.13(a)_  of the  Disclosure Letter, whether
or not such liabilities or obligations arise prior  to  or after the Closing

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, but not limited to, 
all  severance, stay and incentive bonuses) or, with respect to any person
who is  not  a Continuing Employee, arising on or after the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  that  Seller shall not retain any obligations or liabilities
associated with the  Alcoa  Home Exteriors Salary Replacement Plan that
arise after the Closing Date. The  liabilities and obligations retained by
Seller that are set forth in the  preceding sentence shall be considered
Excluded Liabilities for all purposes  of  this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 8.05(o)_  shall  restrict the right of Purchaser to terminate or
modify any employee benefit  plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Closing  Date.

 

(p) _No  Rights Conferred on Employees_.  Nothing  herein expressed or
implied shall confer upon any of the current or former  employees of Seller,
Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates, any rights or  remedies of any nature

limitation, any right to employment or continued employment  for any

**Section 8.06  Tax Matters.**

 



 

(a) The  income of the Company will be determined for the period up to and
including  the  Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by
closing the books of  the  Company as of the end of the Closing Date (or, if
the Closing Date does not  occur on the Targeted Closing Date, the Targeted
Closing Date), and if the  Closing Date does not occur on the Targeted
Closing Date, the income for the  portion of the month that ends on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be the  amount of such income for such month
multiplied by a fraction the numerator  of  which is the number of days in
such month ending on and including the Closing  Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire  month.

 

(b) Seller  shall (i) prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file (or
cause to be  filed) all Tax Returns for the Company for all Tax periods which
end on or  prior  to the Closing Date and which are filed after the Closing
Date, and (ii) pay  all  pre-Closing Taxes of the Company, or shall
reimburse Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates within thirty (30) days after
the later of payment by Purchaser  or  any of its Affiliates of such pre-
Closing Taxes and Purchaser's written  notification to Seller of such
payment. Seller shall prepare such Return in  a  manner consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by Law,  and,  except in the case of
consolidated, combined or unitary Returns that include  members of Alcoa Inc.
(other than the Company), shall deliver any such Return  to  Purchaser for
its review at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such  Return is
required to be filed. If Purchaser disputes any item on such Returns,  it
shall notify Seller of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its 
objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute 
prior  to the date on which the relevant Return is required to be filed. If
the parties  cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be
resolved by  the  CPA Firm. The fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be
borne equally by Seller  and Purchaser.

 

(c) Purchaser  shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and shall timely file
(or cause to  be  filed) all Tax Returns for the Company for Tax periods
which end after the  Closing Date. Purchaser shall, promptly after filing,
provide Seller with a  copy  of each Tax Return prepared for a period ending
on or before December 31, 2006.  Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) to
the appropriate Taxing Authorities  all Taxes of the Company with respect to
such Tax periods. In the case of  Returns that are filed with respect to
Straddle Periods (as defined below),  Purchaser shall prepare such Returns in
a manner consistent with past practice,  except as otherwise required by law.
For purposes of this _Section 8.06_,  in the  case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for  a Tax  period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle  Period"), the portion of
such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period  shall (i) in the case
of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use  Taxes  and income
Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax  period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days  in 
the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator 
of  which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the
case  of  all other Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the  relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date as
determined  pursuant to _Section 8.06(a)_.  The  portion of any refunds or
credits relating to a Tax period that begins before  and ends after the
Closing Date shall be determined as though the relevant  Tax  period ended
on and included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary  to  give
effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent 
with prior practice of Seller and the Company, except as otherwise required 
by  Law.

 

(d) Seller  and Purchaser agree that all matters relating to Taxes, with the
exception  of  payroll and employment Taxes, will be excluded from the Final
Working Capital  Statement. Without limiting the effectiveness of the
provisions of _Section 8.06(e)_,  Taxes  will be settled, from time to time,
on a cash basis from the actual taxes paid  for each such Returns paid by the
respective Seller and Purchaser for taxes  paid  in respect of the Straddle
Period in a manner agreed to by the  parties.

 

(e) Seller  shall be responsible for payment of and shall indemnify, defend,
hold harmless,  pay and reimburse the Purchaser Indemnitees from and against
any and all Losses  (including, without limitation, reasonable fees for
outside counsel, accountants  and other outside consultants) suffered or
incurred (each a "Tax Loss" and  collectively, the "Tax Losses") based upon
arising out of or resulting from  (i) Taxes of Alcoa Inc. or the Company for
periods or portions thereof  ending on or before the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Taxes") in excess of the  amount of payroll and employment Taxes
included as current liabilities; (ii)  Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group  of  which the Company is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date by reason  of liability under Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-6, Treasury Regulation §1.1502-78  or comparable provision
of foreign, state or local law; (iii) without  duplication, Taxes imposed as
a result of (x) a breach of or inaccuracy in  a  representation or warranty
set forth in _Section 4.11_,  as of  the date such representation or
warranty was made or as if such representation  or warranty were made on and
as of the Closing Date (except for such  representations and warranties that
expressly relate to a specified date, the  breach of or inaccuracy in which
will be determined by reference to such  specified date) or (y) a breach of a
covenant or agreement set forth in  _Section 6.07_;  _provided_ ,  that 
for purposes of this _Section 8.06(e)(iii)_  only,  any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be  determined without
reference to any materiality qualifier with respect thereto;  and (iv) Taxes
or other payments required to be paid after the date hereof  by the Company
to any party under any agreement, whether written or not,  relating to the
sharing, allocation or indemnification of Taxes, or any similar  agreement,
contract or arrangement (collectively, "Tax Sharing  Agreement").

 

(f) Purchaser  shall be responsible for payment of and shall indemnify,
defend and hold  harmless Seller and any of its Affiliates from and against
any and all Tax  Losses arising out of (i) all Taxes of the Company for any
Post-Closing Tax  Period; (ii) any Tax Loss attributable to any breach by
Purchaser or any of  its  Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company) of any covenant or  agreement contained in this Agreement; (iii) any
additional Tax Liability of  Seller (including any amount owed by Seller due
to indemnification payments  pursuant to this Agreement) resulting from any
transaction, other than any  transaction or election contemplated by this
Agreement, engaged in by the  Company not in the ordinary course of business
occurring on the Closing Date  after Purchaser's purchase of the Shares; and
(iv) all reasonable legal,  accounting, appraisal, consulting or similar fees
and expenses of Seller and  any  of its Affiliates in contesting any Tax
Liability for which Purchaser is liable  under this _Section 8.06_.

 

(g) Any  Tax  refunds that are received by Purchaser, the Company, or any of
their respective  Affiliates after the Closing, and any amounts credited or
offset against Taxes  of Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates after the  Closing that are actually realized by such parties,
that in each case relate  to  Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company shall
be for the account of Seller.  The  amount or economic benefit of any
refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the  Company for any Post-Closing Tax
Period shall be for the account of Purchaser.  The amount or economic benefit
of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes  of  the Company for any taxable
period that includes but does not end on the Closing  Date shall be equitably
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser within  forty-five (45) days of the
Closing Date.

 

(h) Any  Tax  Sharing Agreement between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on
the one hand,  and  the Company, on the other hand shall be terminated on or
before the Closing  Date  and will have no further effect for any taxable
year.

 

(i) Seller  and Purchaser shall each provide the other with such assistance
as may be  reasonably requested (including access to Books and Records and
making employees  reasonably available to provide information or testimony)
in connection with  the  preparation of any Return or the determination of
liability for Taxes with  respect to the Company or the Business (including
those liabilities as may  arise  pursuant to _Section 8.06(k)_  relating 
to any Contest (as defined below) or other proceeding relating to Taxes). 
Purchaser shall complete Seller's standard Tax packages relating to Returns
that  Seller is responsible for filing pursuant to this _Section 8.06_. 
Seller  and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate
with each  other in preparing and pursuing any claims for refunds or credits
of income  Taxes (including refunds) of the Company. Seller and Purchaser
each shall,  and  shall cause their Affiliates to, retain until the
expiration of the applicable  statute of limitations all Tax Returns,
schedules, work papers, accounting  records and other records that are owned
by such Person immediately after the  Closing Date and that relate to the
Company or the Business; after the end  of  such period, before disposing of
any such Tax Returns, schedules, work papers  or  other records, each shall
give notice to such effect to the other, and shall  give the other, at the
other's cost and expense, a reasonable opportunity to  remove and retain all
or any part of such Tax Returns, schedules, work papers  or  other records
as the other may select. Any information obtained under this  _Section
8.06(i)_  shall be  kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary
in connection with  the  filing of Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or
other Tax  proceeding.

 

(j) If  any  Taxing Authority informs Seller or Purchaser of any notice of a
proposed audit,  claim, assessment or other dispute concerning an amount of
Taxes with respect  to  which the other party may incur liability hereunder,
the party so informed  shall  promptly notify the other party of such
matter. Such notice shall contain  factual information (to the extent known)
describing any asserted Tax Liability  in reasonable detail and shall be
accompanied by copies of any notice or other  documents received from any
Taxing Authority with respect to such matter. If  a  Party has knowledge of
an asserted Tax Liability with respect to a matter for  which it is to be
indemnified hereunder and such party fails to provide the  Indemnitor prompt
notice of such asserted Tax Liability, (i) if the Indemnitor  is precluded
from contesting the asserted Tax Liability in any forum as a result  of the
failure to give prompt notice and could have asserted in good faith  that 
the Tax Liability should be reduced, the Indemnitor shall have no obligation 
to  indemnify the Indemnitee for the amount of such reduction; and (ii) if
the  Indemnitor is not precluded from contesting the asserted Tax Liability
in any  forum, but such failure to provide prompt notice results in a
monetary detriment  to the Indemnitor, then any amount which the Indemnitor
is otherwise required  to  pay pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced
by the amount of such  detriment.

 

(k)  Seller and Purchaser each acknowledge that the Company has used the 
last-in-first-out (LIFO) method of inventory accounting for the Business and 
that the Company will instead use the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method of 
inventory accounting for all periods ending after the Closing Date (a "Post-
Closing Tax Period"). Purchaser will file Form 3115 in respect of this 
change in accounting method, and such change will be effective the day after 
the  Closing Date; _provided_ ,  that  Seller will be given an adequate
opportunity to review such Form 3115 prior  to  its filing with the
appropriate office of the IRS. If Seller disputes any item  on such Form, it
shall notify Purchaser of such disputed item (or items) and  the  basis for
its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any  such 
dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Return is required to be
filed.  If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question
shall  be  resolved by the CPA Firm, and the fees and expenses of the CPA
Firm shall be  borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. For federal income tax
purposes, such  change in accounting method will result in a requirement
under  Section 481(a) of the Code that the Company must report, ratably
during the  four taxable periods immediately after the Closing Date,
additional income  that  is measured with reference to the difference at the
time of the Closing between  inventory costs measured on a LIFO basis and
inventory costs measured on a  FIFO  basis (the "Section 481 Inventory
Adjustment"). Seller shall indemnify, pay and  reimburse the Purchaser
Indemnitees for the amount of additional Taxes payable  in any Post-Closing
Tax Period arising from the Final Section 481 Inventory  Adjustment in the
following manner: by December 15, 2006, Seller shall pay  an amount equal to
25 percent (25%) of the Section 481 Inventory  Adjustment, multiplied by the
Applicable Tax Rate, and on each of April 15,  June 15, September 15 and
December 15 of the years 2007 through  2009, Seller shall pay an amount equal
to one-twelfth (1/12) of the  Section 481 Inventory Adjustment, multiplied by
the Applicable Tax  Rate.

 

(l) Payment  by an Indemnitor of any amount due to an Indemnitee under this
_Section 8.06_  shall be  made within thirty (30) days following written
notice by the Indemnitee that  payment of such amounts to the appropriate
Taxing Authority or other applicable  third party is due by the Indemnitee,
_provided_ ,  that  the Indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment
earlier than five  (5)  Business Days before it is due to the appropriate
Taxing Authority or applicable  third party. Any payments required pursuant
to this _Section 8.06_  that are  not made within the time period specified
shall bear interest at a rate and  in  the manner provided in the Code for
interest on underpayments of federal income  tax.

  

(m) After  the Closing Date, except  as provided below, Purchaser shall
control the conduct, through counsel of  its  own choosing, of any audit,
claim for refund, administrative or judicial  proceeding involving any
asserted Tax Liability or refund with respect to  the  Company (any such
audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an asserted  Tax Liability
referred to herein as a "Contest"). In the case of a Contest after  the
Closing Date that relates solely to Taxes for which Purchaser is indemnified 
under Seller  shall control the conduct of such Contest, but Purchaser shall
have the right  to  participate in such Contest at its own expense, and
Seller shall not be able  to settle,  compromise and/or concede any portion
of such Contest that is reasonably  likely  to affect the Tax liability of
the Company for any taxable year (or portion  thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date without the  reasonable consent of Purchaser,  which  consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;provided,  that, that if Seller
fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Contest  within a
reasonable period following the receipt by Seller of notice of such  Contest,
Purchaser shall have the right to assume control of such Contest  and  shall
be able to settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest in its sole 
discretion. In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates 
both to  Taxes for which Purchaser is indemnified under Section 8.06(e) and
Taxes  for which Purchaser is not indemnified under Section 8.06(e),
Purchaser  shall control the conduct of such Contest, but Seller shall have
the right  to  participate in such Contest at its own expense, and Purchaser
shall not settle,  compromise and/or concede such Contest without the consent
of Seller, which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For
purposes of this  Section 8.06 the term "participation" shall include (i)
participation in  conferences, meetings or proceedings with any Taxing
Authority, the subject  matter of which includes an item for which such party
may have liability  hereunder, (ii) participation in appearances before any
court or tribunal,  the  subject matter of which includes an item for which
a party may have liability  hereunder, and (iii) with respect to the matters
described in the preceding  clauses (i) and (ii), participation in the
submission and determination of  the  content of the documentation,
protests, memorandum of fact and law, briefs,  and  the conduct of oral
arguments and presentations.

  

(n) Purchaser  agrees except as required by applicable law, that it shall
not, and shall not  cause or permit the Company, to carry back to any taxable
period ending on  or  prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss, loss
from operations or other  Tax attribute relating to the Company, and further
agrees that Seller has no  obligation under this Agreement to return or remit
any refund or other Tax  Benefit attributable to a breach by Purchaser of the
foregoing  undertaking.

 

(o) At  Seller's request, Purchaser shall cause the Company to make or join
with Seller  in making any Tax election _provided_   that the  making of
such election does not have a material adverse impact on Purchaser  or  the
Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall not cause the 
Company to make any Tax election, other than any elections contemplated by 
this  Agreement, that would have a material adverse impact on Seller. Seller
shall  not  make or change any Tax elections or file for any change in any
method of  accounting with the IRS with respect to the Company without the
prior consent  of  Purchaser.

 

(p) Seller  shall be responsible for and shall pay all wages paid or to be
paid to Employees  for all periods through and including the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall furnish  (or cause to be furnished) an IRS Form W-2 to each
Employee disclosing all  wages  and other compensation paid for calendar
year 2006, and Taxes withheld  therefrom, and shall prepare, furnish to the
appropriate Employee and/or file  with the appropriate federal, state or
local authority (including but not  limited to the Internal Revenue Service,
and any comparable state or local  agency or authority) such other wage or
compensation-related tax filings or  year-end reconciliations as are required
with respect to calendar year 2006,  and  Seller and its Affiliates shall be
relieved of any responsibility to provide  same to such Employees or file
same with the appropriate authorities.  Additionally, Purchaser shall prepare
and furnish any amended IRS Form W-2  that  is required to be furnished with
respect to the 2006 calendar year and prepare  and file any amended IRS Form
941 that is required to be filed with respect  to  the 2006 calendar year.
Seller shall provide Purchaser with all necessary  payroll records for the
calendar year 2006 through the Closing for Purchaser  to  fulfill its
obligations hereunder.

 

(q) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller on  the  other hand, will each pay one-half of all foreign,
federal, state and local  transfer, stamp, vehicle, sales and use taxes, real
estate transfer taxes,  and  any and all notarial fees imposed or incurred
in connection with the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

**Section 8.07  Intentionally Omitted.**

 



 

**Section 8.08  Alcoa Names; Purchaser's Obligations Post-Closing.**  The 
Company's right to continue the use of the "Alcoa" and "Alumax" trademarks
shall  be pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Trademark License
Agreement  or as  otherwise permitted by Law, attached hereto as Exhibit B.
Except as  explicitly set forth in the Trademark License Agreement, after the
Closing  Date,  neither Purchaser, the Company, nor the Business may use the
names "Alcoa," "Aluminum Company of America," "Alumax" or any trademarks
confusingly similar  thereto for any purpose whatsoever.

 



 

**Section 8.09  Confidentiality.**

 



 

(a) The  terms  of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated by
reference and shall  continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time the  obligations of Purchaser under such Confidentiality Agreement
with respect  to  the Business shall terminate.

 

(b) Except  as  otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, for five
(5) years  following the Closing Date, Seller agrees to, and agrees to cause
each of its  Affiliates and Representatives of each of the foregoing to, keep
confidential  any and all confidential information or documents relating to
the Business  or  the Company known by Seller at the time of Closing and
disclose such information  only to their Representatives, who shall hold such
information confidential.  Seller shall have no liability hereunder for
disclosure of any such information  which (i) is in the public domain other
than as a result of an unauthorized  disclosure by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, (ii) is  required to be disclosed by Law (
_provided_ ,  that  Seller shall provide Purchaser with prompt written
notice of any such  requirement so that Purchaser has an opportunity to seek
a protective order  or  other appropriate remedy), or (iii) has been
provided to any third party  (other than its Representatives) by Purchaser or
its Affiliates (including  the  Company) without restriction as to further
disclosure. For purposes of this  _Section 8.09(b)_,  "confidential
information or documents" means any proprietary information,  documents or
data owned or controlled by or relating to Purchaser or its  Affiliates
(including the Company following the Closing Date).

 



 

**Section 8.10** **Insurance.**

 



 

(a) Purchaser  acknowledges and agrees that effective upon the Closing Date,
all insurance  policies carried by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Company) for the  benefit of the Company with respect to the assets,
operations, activities and  liabilities of the Company and the Business (the
"Seller Insurance Policies")  will cease to provide coverage: (i) for events,
acts, or omissions that occur  after the Closing Date in the case of
"occurrence-based" policies; and (ii) as  of the Closing Date in the case of
"claims-made" policies for any claims made on  or after the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  subject to following Seller's procedures
for applicable Administered Claims  pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) below,
Seller shall be responsible for  and shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless,
pay and reimburse Purchaser from  any  and all Losses based upon, resulting
from arising out of any auto or general  liability accidents or occurrences
which occurred prior to the Closing Date  for  which a claim is first
reported or made to Seller within seven (7) years after  the Closing Date and
that would, except for the sale of the Company, have been  covered by Three
Rivers Insurance Company Internal Deductible Claims-Made  Indemnification
Policies Nos. 498-120 and 498-123, written with limits of  $4,000,000 each
occurrence; $15,000,000 General Aggregate; $10,000,000  Products/Completed
Operations; and $2,000,000 Aggregate Allocated Loss  Adjustment Expense;

program and, as such,  is billed on an ongoing basis by Seller or one of its
Affiliates for the  self-insured or deductible portion of all of the

(including, but not limited to, payment  obligations under deductibles and
self insured retentions) payable on  Administered Claims, and (ii) expenses

extent that any Insurance Payment relates to  an Administered Claim,
Purchaser agrees to reimburse, or to cause the Company  to  reimburse,
Seller, its Affiliates, or their respective assigns or designees,  as  the
case may be, for the amount of the Insurance Payment within thirty (30) 
days  of receipt of such request for reimbursement and customary
documentation  evidencing such payment; _provided_ ,  that  Purchaser shall
not be obligated to reimburse or cause the Company to reimburse  Seller, its
Affiliates or their respective assigns or designees of any such  Insurance
Payment (A) related to an Administered Claim that is subject to an 
indemnification or other payment or reimbursement obligation of Seller under 
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, (B) related to an Administered 
Claim under Seller's or Seller's Affiliate's (including Three Rivers')
worker's  compensation insurance policy or (C) that would have been covered
under the  insurance policy(ies) of Three Rivers but for the bankruptcy or
insolvency  of  Three Rivers.

 

(d) _Cooperation_.  Purchaser shall cause the Company to fully cooperate with
Seller, its  Affiliates, their insurers and claims administrators in the
defense of all  Administered Claims for which the Business is entitled to
defense and  indemnification.

 



 

**Section 8.11** **Non-Competition;  Non-Solicitation.**

 



 

(a) Seller  acknowledges that (v) the Company is engaged in the Business; (w)
the Business  is conducted throughout the United States of America and
Canada; (x) its  ownership until the Closing Date of the Company has given it
access to the  trade  secrets of and confidential information concerning the
Company; (y) the  agreements and covenants contained in this _Section 8.11_ 
are  essential to protect the Business and goodwill of the Company; and (z)
Purchaser  would not purchase the Shares but for such agreements and
covenants.  Accordingly, Seller covenants and agrees as follows:

 

(i) Subject  to the remainder of this clause (i), Seller shall not, and shall
not permit  any  of its Affiliates to, in the United States of America or in
Canada, directly  or  indirectly, (A) engage in the Business for a period of
five (5) years commencing  on the Closing Date; (B) engage in the sale,
manufacture or distribution of  the type of products that are substantially

Business or for the purpose of competing with  the Business for a period of

in any capacity, including as a partner,  shareholder, member, employee,
principal, agent, trustee or consultant for  a  period of five (5) years
commencing on the Closing Date; or  (D) intentionally interfere in any
material respect with the business  relationships (whether formed prior to or
after the date of this Agreement)  between the Company and customers or
suppliers of the Company for a period  of  five (5) years commencing on the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Seller or one of its Affiliates
may own, directly or indirectly, solely as  an  investment, securities of
any Person if Seller is not a controlling Person  of,  or a member of a
group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or  indirectly, own
5% or more of any class of securities of such Person; and,  _provided_
_further_ ,  that  nothing herein shall (i) restrict Seller or one of its
Affiliates from merging  with or into or otherwise acquiring, any Person
engaged in the Business, and  thereafter receiving all of the benefits of
such merger or ownership, so long  as  at the time of such acquisition the
revenues derived from such Person's  engagement in the Business are less than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the total  revenues of the Person or (ii)
restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates from  continuing to participate in,
own and operate the businesses conducted by such  parties as of the Closing
Date; and

 

(ii) For  a  period of two (2) years commencing on the Closing Date, Seller
shall not, and  shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly, hire or  solicit any employee of the Company or encourage any
such employee to leave  such  employment, nor shall Seller hire, or permit
any of its Affiliates to hire,  directly or indirectly, any employee of the
Company who has left such employment  for a period of six months from the
time when such employee leaves his/her  employment ( _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  such six month period shall not extend beyond two (2) years
commencing on the  Closing Date) or with the prior written consent of
Purchaser, except pursuant  to  a general solicitation or employment
searches which are not directed  specifically to any such employees.

 

(b) If  Seller  breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the
provisions of this  _Section 8.11_,  Purchaser and the Company shall have
the following rights and remedies, each  of  which rights and remedies shall
be independent of the others and severally  enforceable, and each of which is
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other  rights and remedies available
to Purchaser or the Company under law or in  equity:

 

(i) the  right  and remedy to have such provision specifically enforced by
any court having  equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach  or  threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to each
of Purchaser and the  Company and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Purchaser  or the Company; and

 

(ii) the  right  and remedy to require Seller to account for and pay over to
Purchaser or the  Company, as the case may be, all compensation, profits,
monies, accruals,  increments or other benefits derived or received by Seller
or its Affiliates  as  the result of any transactions constituting a breach
of such  provision.

 

(c) Seller  acknowledges and agrees that as to it the provisions of this
_Section 8.11_  are  reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope
and in all other  respects. If any court of competent jurisdiction determines
that all or any  part  of any of this _Section 8.11_  is  invalid or
unenforceable as to Seller, the remainder of this _Section 8.11_  shall  not
be affected and shall be given full effect as to Seller, without regard  to 
the invalid portions.

 

(d) If  any  court of competent jurisdiction determines that all or any part
of this  _Section 8.11_  is  unenforceable as to Seller, such court shall
have the power to reduce the scope  of this _Section 8.11_  and, in  its
reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable.

survive any such termination. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant 
to (x) _Section 9.01(c)_  or (y)  _Section 9.01(b)_  and, in  the case of
this clause (y), all of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to 
consummate the Closing under Article VII have been satisfied (other than any 
such conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied by the Closing

Purchaser Termination Fee shall be payable in  immediately available funds no
later than three (3) Business Days after such  termination. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  Seller's right to receive

shall be  the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller or any of its Affiliates
against  Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective

of Purchaser  contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by  or  on behalf of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, as of
the date such  representation or warranty was made or as if such
representation or warranty  was  made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties  that expressly relate to a specified
date, the breach of or inaccuracy in which  will be determined with reference
to such specified date); or

 

(ii) any  breach or nonfulfillment of any of the covenants or agreements of
Purchaser  contained in this Agreement.

 



 

**Section 13.03  Limitations on Indemnification**.  The  party making a
claim under this Article 13 is referred to as the "Indemnitee," and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article 13 is  referred to
as the "Indemnitor." The indemnification provided for in  _Sections 13.01_ 
and  _13.02_   shall be  subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(a) _Deductible_.  Subject  to _Section 13.03(b)_,  Seller  shall not be
liable to the Purchaser Indemnitees for indemnification under  _Sections
11.05_  or  _13.01(i)_ ,  (except  in the case of an indemnification claim
under _Section 13.01(i)_,  those  based upon, arising out of or resulting
from any breach of or inaccuracy in  any  representation or warranty in
_Sections 4.01_  (Seller's Authority; Consents and Approval), (excluding the
last sentence  thereof), _4.03_   (Capitalization; Title to Shares),
_4.12(c)_   (Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities; Indebtedness),
_4.16_   (No  Brokers), and any Loss incurred in the successful enforcement
of Purchaser's  indemnity rights provided for in _Sections 13.01_  or 
_11.05_   (the "Purchaser Deductible Exclusions"), until the aggregate
amount of Losses in  respect of indemnification under _Sections 11.05_  or 
_13.01(i)_   (except  those based upon, arising out of or resulting from the
Purchaser Deductible  Exclusions) exceeds $2,500,000 (the "Deductible"), in
which event the amount  which the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to
recover is all such Losses  in excess of the Deductible. Seller shall be
obligated to pay any amounts for  indemnification based upon, arising out of
or resulting from any of Purchaser  Deductible Exclusions, without regard to
the individual or aggregate amounts  thereof and without regard to whether
all other indemnification payments shall  have exceeded, in the aggregate,
the Deductible.

 

(b) _Cap_.  The  indemnification obligations of Seller under _Sections
11.05_  and  _13.01(i)_   (except  in the case of any indemnification
claim under _Section  13.01(i)_ ,  those  based upon, arising out of or
resulting from the Purchaser Deductible  Exclusions) will not exceed
$45,750,000 in the aggregate (the "Cap Amount").  Seller shall be obligated
to pay any amounts for indemnification based upon,  arising out of or
resulting from a Purchaser Deductible Exclusion, without  regard to the
individual or aggregate amounts thereof and without regard to  whether all
other indemnification payments shall have exceeded, in the  aggregate, the
Cap Amount.

 

(c)  _Duration_.  All  obligations of an Indemnitor to indemnify an
Indemnitee with respect to the  breach of a particular representation or
warranty under _Sections 13.01(i)_  or  _13.02(i)_   will  expire when
such representation or warranty expires pursuant to _Section 12.01_,  the 
obligations of Seller to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to _Section 11.05_ 
(Environmental Indemnification) will expire as set forth in _Section 11.06_, 
and the  obligations of an Indemnitor to indemnify an Indemnitee with respect
to the  breach of a covenant or agreement under _Sections  13.01(ii)_  
or  _13.02(ii)_   will  expire two (2) years after the date on which the
obligation to perform such  covenant or agreement expires; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  the obligation of the Indemnitor to indemnify and hold
harmless the Indemnitee  pursuant to this Article 13 shall not terminate with
respect to any matter  as to  which the Indemnitee shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period,  previously made a claim by delivering a
notice pursuant to _Section 14.04_  (stating  in reasonable detail the basis
of such claim) to the other party  hereto.

 

(d)  _Additional  Limits_.  The  amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article  13  will be net of (and the
cumulative amount of all Losses for the purposes of  determining the
Deductible and the Cap Amount will be net of): (1) any amount  reflecting
Losses specifically reflected in the calculation of the Closing  Working
Capital on the Final Working Capital Statement, (2) any amount  actually
received by the Indemnitee or paid to Third Parties on behalf of the 
Indemnitee under insurance policies of the Indemnitee with respect to such 
Loss  (and the Indemnitee will be required to submit a claim under such
insurance  policies with respect to such Loss), (3) any Tax savings
attributable to any  deduction, credit or other tax benefit actually realized
by the Indemnitee  with  respect to such Loss ("Tax Benefits") and (4) the
amount of any benefit to, or  saving for, actually realized by the Indemnitee
as a result of the payment  or  settlement of any item giving rise to such
claim. In computing the amount of  any  Tax Benefit, the Indemnitee shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of  income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit before recognizing any item arising  from  the receipt of any
indemnification payment hereunder or the incurrence or  payment of any
indemnified Loss; _provided_ ,  that,  if a Tax Benefit is not realized in
the taxable period during which an  Indemnitor makes an indemnification
payment or the Indemnitee incurs or pays  any  Loss, the parties hereto
shall thereafter make payments to one another at the  end of each subsequent
taxable period to reflect the net Tax Benefits realized  by the parties
hereto in each such subsequent taxable period. For purposes  of  determining
the amount of Loss arising from a breach of or inaccuracy in any 
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, but not for the purposes of 
determining whether any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement 
has  been breached or is inaccurate, limitations or qualifications as to
dollar  amount, materiality or Material Adverse Effect (or similar concept)
set forth  in  such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be
disregarded.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, with
respect to the  Lake  Forest Liability (as defined in _Section 1.01(r)_  of
the  Disclosure Letter), Seller's obligation to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless  the Purchaser Indemnitees shall also be governed by the terms of
the Warranty  Claims Indemnity Agreement and shall not be subject to the
Deductible, or the  Cap Amount set forth in _Section 13.03(b)_.

 



 

**Section 13.04  Procedures for Indemnification**.

 



 

(a) _Third  Party Claims_.  If any  Indemnitee receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Claim made  or  brought by any Person who
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate  of a  party to this
Agreement or a Representative of any of the foregoing (a "Third  Party
Claim") against such Indemnitee with respect to which the Indemnitor is 
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee
will  give the Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event  not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of
such Third  Party  Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however,  relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification
obligations, except and only  to  the extent that the Indemnitor forfeits
rights or defenses by reason of such  failure. Such notice by the Indemnitee
will describe the Third Party Claim  in  reasonable detail, will include
copies of all material written evidence thereof  and will indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss  that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The Indemnitor will have  the right to
participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnitee,  to  assume
the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnitor's expense and by  the
Indemnitor's own counsel, and the Indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in 
such defense; _provided_ ,  that if  the Indemnitor is Seller, such
Indemnitor shall not have the right to defend  or  direct the defense of any
such Third Party Claim that (x) is asserted directly  by or on behalf of a
Person that is a supplier or customer of the Company if  in  the reasonable
judgment of the Purchaser Indemnitee (which may be asserted  at  any time)
the Indemnitor's defense of such Third Party Claim would reasonably be 
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Purchaser Indemnitee's (or
the  Company's) existing or prospective relationship with such supplier or
customer,  or (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the 
Indemnitee. In the event that Indemnitor assumes the defense of any Third
Party  Claim, subject to _Section 13.04(b)_,  it  shall have the right to
take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,  dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third  Party  Claim in the name
and on behalf of Indemnitee. The Indemnitee shall have the  right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel  selected by
it subject to the Indemnitor's right to control the defense thereof.  The
fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the 
Indemnitee, _provided_ ,  that,  if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnitee, (A) there are  legal defenses available to an Indemnitee that
are different from or additional  to those available to the Indemnitor or (B)
there exists a conflict of  interest between the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitee that cannot be waived, the  Indemnitor shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one separate  counsel to all of the
applicable Indemnitees in addition to one local counsel  in  each
jurisdiction that may be necessary or appropriate. If the Indemnitor elects 
not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify 
the  Indemnitee in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement,  or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the  Indemnitee may, subject to _Section 13.04(b)_,  pay, 
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any 
and  all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party
Claim.  Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in all
reasonable respects  in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim,
including making  available (subject to the provisions of _Section 8.09_) 
records  relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense
(other than  reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending
party,  management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary  for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim or
for testimony  as  a witness in any proceeding relating to such Third Party
Claim.

 

(b) _Settlement  of Third Party Claims_.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnitor will  not  enter into settlement
of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent  of the
Indemnitee, except as provided in this _Section  13.04_.  If a  firm offer
is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability  or  the
creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee 
and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Purchaser  Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third  Party Claim and the Indemnitor desires to accept and agree to
such offer, the  Indemnitor will give written notice to the Indemnitee to
that effect. If the  Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer within 10
calendar days after  its  receipt of such notice, the Indemnitee may
continue to contest or defend such  Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnitor  as  to such Third Party Claim will not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer.  If the Indemnitee fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume  defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor may settle the Third Party  Claim upon the terms
set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party  Claim. If the
Indemnitee has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 13.04(a)_  it will 
not agree to any settlement without the consent of the Indemnitor which
shall  not be reasonable withheld.

 

(c) _Direct  Claims_.  Any  Claim by an Indemnitee on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third  Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be
asserted by Indemnitee giving the  Indemnitor reasonably prompt written
notice thereof, but in any event not later  than 30 calendar days after the
Indemnitee becomes aware of such Direct Claim.  The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve  the  Indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent  that the
Indemnitor forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.  Such 
notice by the Indemnitee shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail,  will include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
will indicate  the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been  or  may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The Indemnitor will
have 30 calendar days  to  respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnitee shall allow the  Indemnitor and its professional advisers to
investigate the matter or  circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what  extent any amount is payable in respect of
the Direct Claim and the Indemnitee  shall assist the Indemnitor's
investigation by giving such information and  assistance (including access to
the Business' premises and personnel and the  right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnitor  or any of its professional
advisers may reasonably request. If the Indemnitor  does not so respond
within such 30 calendar day period, the Indemnitor will  be  deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnitee will be free  to  pursue
such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on the terms and  subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Cooperation_.  Upon a  reasonable request by the Indemnitor, each
Indemnitee seeking indemnification  hereunder in respect of any Direct Claim,
hereby agrees to consult with the  Indemnitor and act reasonably to take
actions reasonably requested by the  Indemnitor in order to attempt to reduce
the amount of Losses in respect of  such  Direct Claim. Any costs or
expenses associated with taking such actions shall  be  included as Losses
hereunder.

 



 

**Section 13.05  Exclusive Remedies.**  Subject  to the terms of the
Support Services Agreement and Trademark License Agreement,  the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with  respect to
any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal  activity
or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in connection  with  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any 
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein or
otherwise  relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the  indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 8.06_ 
(with  respect to tax matters), Articles 11 (with respect to environmental
matters)  and  Article 13. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the  fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of  action for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement  set  forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement  it  may have against the other parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of  their  respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant  to the indemnification
provisions set forth in _Section 8.06_  (with  respect to tax matters),
Article 11 (with respect to environmental matters)  and  this Article 13.
Nothing in this _Section 13.05_  shall  limit any Person's right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief to which any  Person shall be entitled or to seek
any remedy on account of any Person's  fraudulent, criminal or intentional
misconduct.

 



 

**Section 13.06** **Treatment  of Payments.**   All  payments made under
indemnity provisions of this Agreement, including payments  under _Section
8.06_  (Tax  Matters), will be treated by the parties as purchase price 
adjustments.
