the accounts of the Exchange Agent, solely for the benefit of the Pre-
Closing ARYA Holders, for further contribution immediately following the
First Merger Effective Time as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(vii)_ (the "
_First Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ , that the Sponsor Warrants shall

except as otherwise provided for herein or under applicable Law.

(vii) Immediately following the First Merger Effective Time, and in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2:94b of the Dutch Civil Code ( _Burgerlijk

Consideration will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the

event, be the First Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this provision.

represent, immediately following the First Merger Effective Time, a right
to acquire TopCo Ordinary Shares (a " _Converted Warrant_ ") on the same
contractual terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time under the terms of the Warrant Agreement;
_provided_ , that each Converted Warrant: (a) shall represent the right to
acquire the number of TopCo Ordinary Shares equal to the number of ARYA Class
A Shares subject to each such ARYA Warrant immediately prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time; (b) shall have an exercise price of $11.50 per whole
warrant required to purchase one TopCo Ordinary Share; and (c) shall expire on

right to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the SAR
Value over the applicable exercise price of the Vested Company SAR, multiplied
by the number of Company Shares subject to such Vested Company SAR (such cash
payment, the " _SAR Cash Proceeds_ "). Prior to the Closing, the Company and
TopCo may direct that the applicable transactions set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.6(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ be deemed to occur simultaneously with the
cancellation of the Vested Company SARs, respectively, as set forth in in the
preceding sentence, _provided_ , that all such transactions shall occur
effective and completed in full at the Closing. __

 

(b) Effective at the Closing, certain recipients of SAR Cash Proceeds shall be
permitted or required, as applicable, to re-invest a portion of such SAR Cash
Proceeds in TopCo Ordinary Shares as follows: (i) each Management Member shall
purchase the number of TopCo Ordinary Shares equal to 50% of the SAR Cash
Proceeds to be received by such Management Member (determined on a pre-Tax
basis) divided by the TopCo Ordinary Share Value; (ii) each Active Employee
shall purchase the number of TopCo Ordinary Shares equal to 25% (and, at
their election, provided such election is made no later than 10 days prior to
the Closing, shall be permitted to purchase the number of TopCo Ordinary
Shares equal to 50%) of the SAR Cash Proceeds to be received by such Active
Employee (determined on a pre-Tax basis) divided by the TopCo Ordinary Share
Value; and (iii) the Other Founder shall be permitted, at the discretion of
the Company, to purchase the number of TopCo Ordinary Shares equal to up to
50% of the SAR Cash Proceeds to be received by such Other Founder (determined
on a pre-Tax basis) divided by the TopCo Ordinary Share Value.

 



23

    

(c) Effective at the Closing, for each TopCo Ordinary Share purchased by the
re-investment of SAR Cash Proceeds by a Management Member, Active Employee and
Other Founder, pursuant to Section 2.6(b), TopCo will grant such individual an
option to purchase two TopCo Ordinary Shares under the TopCo Equity Plan (as
defined below), with an exercise price equal to the TopCo Ordinary Share Value
(or such higher exercise price as is necessary for such option to be exempt
from Section 409A of the Code), which will vest in full on July 31, 2021,
subject to the grantees continuous service through such date and with such
additional terms and conditions as the supervisory board of the Company shall
approve.

 

(d) Effective at the Closing, each Unvested Company SAR that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing shall cease to represent the right to
receive Company Shares or a cash payment based on the value of Company Shares
and shall be canceled in exchange for a TopCo Option under the TopCo Equity
Plan (as such terms are defined below) in an amount, at an exercise price and
subject to such terms and conditions determined as set forth below. Each such
Unvested Company SAR so converted by TopCo (each, a " _Converted Option_ ")
shall be exercisable for, and represent the right to acquire, that number of
TopCo Ordinary Shares equal to (A) the number of Company Shares subject to
such Unvested Company SAR _multiplied by_ (B) the SAR Exchange Ratio and
rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (ii) the exercise price per TopCo
Ordinary Share subject to each converted Unvested Company SAR shall be an
amount equal to (A) the exercise price per Company Share subject to such
Unvested Company SAR _divided by_ (B) the SAR Exchange Ratio and rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. The Converted Options shall vest over three years
following the vesting commencement date of July 31, 2020, in twelve equal
quarterly installments, subject to the grantees continuous service as of each
vesting date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the
actions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(d)_ shall be taken in
accordance with Section 409A and, if applicable, Section 422 of the Code.

 

(e) Effective at the Closing, any Company SAR that is not a Vested Company SAR
or Unvested Company SAR will be canceled for no consideration.

would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization of the Group Companies_.

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as

exculpation provisions of

 



67

    

 the ARYA Governing Documents shall not, during such six (6)-year period, be

corporation or entity and shall not be the surviving or continuing corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or

Section 9.16 _Arbitration_. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that any Proceeding based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(each, a " _Related Proceeding_ ") shall be finally settled by
binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators. Any Related Proceeding
shall be decided by a panel of three (3) arbitrators seated in New York, New
York. Each arbitrator must be (a) an attorney with significant experience in
negotiating complex commercial transactions, or a judge seated on, or retired
from, a U.S. federal court sitting in the Southern District of New York or the
Delaware Court of Chancery and (b) neutral and independent of each Party. The
Parties agree, pursuant to Article 30(2)(b) of the Rules of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce, that the Expedited Procedure Rules shall
apply irrespective of the amount in dispute. The arbitrators may enter a
default decision against any Party who fails to participate in the arbitration
proceedings with respect to any Related Proceeding. The language of the
proceeding shall be English. The decision of the arbitrators on the points in
dispute will be final, unappealable and binding, and judgment on the award may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties and the
arbitrators will keep confidential, and will not disclose to any Person,
except the Parties respective Representatives (who shall keep any such
information confidential as provided in this sentence), or as may be required
by applicable Law or any Order of a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction, the existence of any Related Proceeding under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.16_, the referral of any such Related Proceeding to
arbitration or the status or resolution thereof. The initiation of any Related
Proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.16_ will toll the applicable
statute of limitations for the duration of any such Related Proceeding.

 

Section 9.17 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their respective
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without
posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages and this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. 

Section 9.18 _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus
of ARYA, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-227283) on October 4, 2018 (the "
_Prospectus_ "). The Company, TopCo and the Merger Subs each acknowledges and
agrees and understand that ARYA has established a trust account (the " _Trust
Account_ ") containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (the "
_IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the
IPO (including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of
ARYAs public shareholders (including overallotment shares acquired by ARYAs
underwriters, the " _Public Shareholders_ "), and ARYA may disburse monies
from the Trust Account only in the express

 



80

    

 circumstances described in the Prospectus. For and in consideration of ARYA
entering into this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company,
TopCo and the Merger Subs each hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Representatives that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Company, TopCo, either Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives does now or shall at any time hereafter have any
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust
Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such
claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to,
this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between ARYA or
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Company, TopCo, either Merger
Sub or any of their respective Representatives, on the other hand, or any
other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Trust_ _Account Released
Claims_ "). The Company, TopCo and each Merger Sub on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Representatives hereby irrevocably waives any Trust Account
Released Claims that the Company, TopCo, each Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives may have against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out
of, any negotiations, or Contracts with AYRA or its Representatives and will
not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of any
agreement with AYRA or its Affiliates).

2\. _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_.

2.1 _Resale Shelf Registration Rights_.

2.1.1 _Registration Statement Covering Resale of Registrable Securities_.
Provided compliance by the Investors with _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, TopCo shall
prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed with the Commission, no
later than forty five (45) days following the Closing Date, a Registration
Statement on Form F-3 or its successor form, or, if the Company is ineligible
to use Form F-3, a Registration Statement on Form F-1, for an offering to be
made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act
registering the resale from time to time by Investors of all of the
Registrable Securities then held by such Investors that are not covered by an
effective resale registration statement (the "Resale Shelf Registration
Statement"). TopCo shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as possible after
filing, and in no event later than the date that the Lock-up Period expires,
and once effective, to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act at all times until the
expiration of the Effectiveness Period. In the event that TopCo files a Form
F-1 pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, TopCo shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to convert the Form F-1 to a Form F-3 as soon as
practicable after TopCo is eligible to use Form F-3.

 



5

    

2.1.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. TopCo shall notify the
Investors in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number of copies of
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any amendments, supplements
and exhibits), the prospectus contained therein (including each preliminary
prospectus and all related amendments and supplements) and any documents
incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or such
other documents as the Investors may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the sale of the Registrable Securities in the manner described in
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement.

 

2.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 2.1.1_ above, TopCo shall promptly prepare and file with the Commission
from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and prospectus used in connection therewith as may be
necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective and to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness Period.

 

2.1.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 2.1_, in the event the Commission informs TopCo that all of the
Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be
registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration
statement, TopCo agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the holders thereof
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii)
withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and file a new registration
statement (a "New Registration Statement"), in either case covering the
maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the
Commission, on Form F-1, Form F-3 or such other form available to register for
resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering; provided, however,
that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration Statement, TopCo shall
be obligated to use its commercially reasonable efforts to advocate with the
Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable Securities in
accordance with any publicly-available written or oral guidance, comments,
requirements or requests of the Commission staff (the "SEC Guidance"),
including, without limitation, the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of the number of Registrable
Securities permitted to be registered on a particular Registration Statement
as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that TopCo used diligent efforts
to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all or a greater
number of Registrable Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a
holder as to its Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities
to be registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced on a Pro Rata
basis, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain Investors
must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities held by
such Investors. In the event TopCo amends the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under
clauses (i) or (ii) above, TopCo will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC
Guidance provided to TopCo or to registrants of securities in general, one or
more registration statements on Form F-1, Form F-3 or such other form
available to register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not
registered for resale on the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended,
or the New Registration Statement.

 



6

    

2.1.5 _Notice of Certain Events_. TopCo shall promptly notify the Investors in
writing of any request by the Commission for any amendment or supplement to,
or additional information in connection with, the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement required to be prepared and filed hereunder (or prospectus relating
thereto). TopCo shall promptly notify each Investor in writing of the filing
of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus, amendment or
supplement related thereto or any post-effective amendment to the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment.

2.1.6 _Underwritten Takedown_. If TopCo shall receive a request from the
holders of Registrable Securities with an estimated market value of at least
$25,000,000 that TopCo effect a Underwritten Takedown of all or any portion of
the requesting holders Registrable Securities, then TopCo shall promptly give
notice of such requested Underwritten Takedown at least seven (7) Business
Days prior to the anticipated filing date of the prospectus or supplement
relating to such Underwritten Takedown to the other Investors and thereupon
shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect, as expeditiously as
possible, the offering in such Underwritten Takedown of:

(i) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2.4_, all
Registrable Securities for which the requesting holder has requested such
offering under _Section_ __ _ 2.1.6_, and

 

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2.4_, all
other Registrable Securities that any holders of Registrable Securities have
requested TopCo to offer by request received by TopCo within two (2) Business
Days after such holders receive TopCos notice of the Underwritten Takedown
Notice, all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance
with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the Registrable Securities
so to be offered.

(a) Promptly after the expiration of the two-Business Day-period referred to
in _Section_ __ _ 2.1.6(ii)_, TopCo will notify all selling holders of
the identities of the other selling holders and the number of shares of
Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

(b) TopCo shall only be required to effectuate: (i) one Underwritten Takedown
by each of (A) the ARYA Investors, collectively, and (B) the Company
Investors, collectively within any six-month period; (ii) no more than three
Underwritten Takedowns in respect of all Registrable Securities held by ARYA
Investors after giving effect to _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1(c)_; and (iii) no more
than [three] Underwritten Takedowns in respect of all Registrable Securities
held by Company Investors after giving effect to _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1(d)_.

2.1.7  _Block Trade_. If TopCo shall receive a request from the holders of
Registrable Securities with an estimated market value of at least $10,000,000
that TopCo effect the sale of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities
in a Block Trade, then TopCo shall, as expeditiously as possible, the
offering in such Block Trade of the Registrable Securities for which such
requesting holder has requested such offering under _Section_ __ _ 2.1.7_.

 



7

    

2.1.8 _Selection of Underwriters_. Selling holders holding a majority in
interest of the Registrable Securities requested to be sold in an
Underwritten Takedown shall have the right to select an Underwriter or
Underwriters in connection with such Underwritten Takedown, which Underwriter
or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to TopCo. In connection with
an Underwritten Takedown, TopCo shall enter into customary agreements
(including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other
actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate
the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Takedown,
including, if necessary, the engagement of a "qualified independent
underwriter" in connection with the qualification of the underwriting
arrangements with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

2.1.9 Underwritten Takedowns effected pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.1_ shall be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.2_.

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

 

2.2.1 _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time after the
expiration of any lock-up to which an Investors shares are subject, if any,
provided compliance by the Investors with _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, and provided
further there is not an effective Resale Shelf Registration Statement
available for the resale of the Registerable Securities pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1_ (i) ARYA Investors who hold a majority of the Registrable
Securities held by all ARYA Investors, (ii) Dievini or (iii) Company
Investors (other than Dievini) who hold []1 of the Registrable Securities
held by all Company Investors, as the case may be, may make a written demand
for Registration under the Securities Act of all or any portion of their
Registrable Securities on Form F-1 or any similar long-form Registration or,
if then available, on Form F-3. Each registration requested pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_ is referred to herein as a "Demand Registration". Any
demand for a Demand Registration shall specify the number of shares of
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. TopCo will notify all Investors that are holders of
Registrable Securities of the demand, and each such holder of Registrable
Securities who wishes to include all or a portion of such holders
Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration (each such holder including
shares of Registrable Securities in such registration, a "Demanding Holder")
shall so notify TopCo within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the
holder of the notice from TopCo. Upon any such request, the Demanding Holders
shall be entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in the Demand
Registration, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2.4_ and the provisos set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1.1_. TopCo shall not be obligated to effect: (a) more than
one (1) Demand Registration during any six-month period; (b) any
Demand Registration at any time there is an effective Resale Shelf
Registration Statement on file with the Commission pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1_; (c) more than three Underwritten Demand Registrations in respect of all
Registrable Securities held by ARYA Investors; or (d) more than [three]
Underwritten Demand Registrations in respect of all Registrable Securities
held by Company Investors.

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and TopCo has
complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect
thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration Statement has
been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the Registration
Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed not to have
been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction
is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest
of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the offering; provided,
further, that TopCo shall not be obligated to file a second
Registration Statement until a Registration Statement that has been filed is
counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

2.2.3 _Underwritten Demand Registration_. If the Demanding Holders so elect
and such holders so advise TopCo as part of their written demand for a Demand
Registration, the offering of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Demand
Registration. In such event, the right of any holder to include its
Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such
holders participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of
such holders Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent
provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters
selected for such underwriting by the holders initiating the Demand
Registration, and subject to the approval of TopCo. The parties agree that, in
order to be effected, any Underwritten Demand Registration must result in
either aggregate proceeds to the selling shareholders of at least $[]
million2.

 

2.2.4 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters for
a Underwritten Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering
advises TopCo and the Demanding Holders in writing that, in such Underwriters
or Underwriters opinion, the dollar amount or number of shares of Registrable
Securities which the Demanding Holders desire to sell, taken together with
all other TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities which TopCo desires to
sell and the Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights held
by other shareholders of TopCo who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of shares that can be sold in such offering without
adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution
method, or the probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of shares, as applicable, the "Maximum Number of
Shares"), then TopCo shall include in such registration: (i) first, the
Registrable Securities as to which Demand Registration has been requested by
the Demanding Holders (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares that
each such person has requested be included in such registration, regardless of
the number of shares held by each such person (such proportion is referred to
herein as "Pro Rata")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Shares; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has
not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the TopCo Ordinary Shares or
other securities that TopCo desires



 



   2  |

 to sell; and (iii) any TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities for the
account of other persons that TopCo is obligated to register pursuant to
written contractual arrangements with such persons, as to which "piggy-back"
registration has been requested by the holders thereof that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

 

2.2.5 _Withdrawal_. A majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders may elect
to withdraw from such Demand Registration by giving written notice to TopCo
and the Underwriter or Underwriters of their request to withdraw prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration. If the majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders withdraws from a proposed offering, then either the
Demanding Holders shall reimburse TopCo for the costs associated with the
withdrawn registration (in which case such registration shall not count as a
Demand Registration provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_) or the withdrawn
registration shall count as a Demand Registration provided for in _Section_
__ _ 2.2.1_.

2.3 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

 

2.3.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time after the expiration of the any
lock-up to which an Investors shares are subject, if any, provided
compliance by the Investors with _Section_ __ _ 3.4,_ TopCo proposes to file
a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering
of equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity securities, by TopCo for its own
account or for shareholders of TopCo for their account (or by TopCo and by
shareholders of TopCo including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.2.1_), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with
any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or
offering of securities solely to TopCos existing shareholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of TopCo or (iv)
for a dividend reinvestment plan, then TopCo shall (x) give written notice of
such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable Securities as soon as
practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days before the anticipated
filing date, which notice shall describe the amount and type of securities to
be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the
name of the proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, of the
offering, and (y) offer to the holders of Registrable Securities in such
notice the opportunity to register the sale of such number of shares of
Registrable Securities as such holders may request in writing within five (5)
days following receipt of such notice (a "Piggy-Back Registration"). The
foregoing rights shall not be available to any Investor at such time as (i)
there is an effective Resale Shelf Registration Statement available for the
resale of the Registerable Securities pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, (ii)
such Registration is solely to be used for the offering of securities by
TopCo for its own account and (iii) no other shareholder of TopCo is entitled
to participate in such Registration. TopCo shall cause such Registrable
Securities to be included in such registration and shall use its best efforts
to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten
offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a
Piggy-Back Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar
securities of TopCo and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to
distribute their securities through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves
an Underwriter or Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-
Back Registration.

 



10

    

2.3.2 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters for
a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises
TopCo and the holders of Registrable Securities in writing that the dollar
amount or number of TopCo Ordinary Shares which TopCo desires to sell, taken
together with Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which registration has been
demanded pursuant to written contractual arrangements with persons other than
the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder and the Registrable Securities
as to which registration has been requested under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_,
exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares, then TopCo shall include in any such
registration:

 

(a) If the registration is undertaken for TopCos account: (A) first, the
TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities that TopCo desires to sell that can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and (B) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities, if any,
comprised of Registrable Securities, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Shares, Pro Rata; and (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A)
and (B), the TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of
other persons that TopCo is obligated to register pursuant to written
contractual piggy-back registration rights with such persons and that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and

(b) If the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the demand
of persons other than either the holders of Registrable Securities or TopCo,
(A) first, the TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of
the demanding persons that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Shares; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the TopCo Ordinary Shares or
other securities that TopCo desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A)
and (B), the TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities, if any, comprised of
Registrable Securities, Pro Rata, as to which registration has been requested
pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the
TopCo Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of other persons
that TopCo is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual
arrangements with such persons, that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Shares.

2.3.3 _Withdrawal_. Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such holders request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any
Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to TopCo of such request to
withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, if
such offering is pursuant to a Demand Registration, or prior to the public
announcement of the offering, if such offering is pursuant to an Underwritten
Takedown. TopCo (whether on its own determination or as the result of a
withdrawal by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual
obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any such
withdrawal, TopCo shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of
Registrable Securities in connection with such Piggy-Back Registration as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

 



11

    

3\. _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_.

 

3.1 _Filings; Information_. Whenever TopCo is required to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2_,

intended method(s) of distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable,
and in connection with any such request:

3.1.1 _Filing Registration Statement_. TopCo shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, as expeditiously as possible after receipt of a request for
a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, prepare and file with

qualifies or which counsel for TopCo shall deem appropriate and which form
shall be available for the sale of all Registrable Securities to be registered
thereunder in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration
Statement to become effective and use its reasonable best efforts to keep it
effective for the Effectiveness Period; provided, however, that TopCo shall
have the right to defer any Demand Registration for up to sixty (60) days,
and any Piggy-Back Registration for such period as may be applicable to
deferment of any Demand Registration to which such Piggy-Back Registration
relates, in each case if TopCo shall furnish to the holders a certificate
signed by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of TopCo stating that, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of TopCo (the "TopCo
Board"), it would be materially detrimental to TopCo and its shareholders for
such Registration Statement to be effected at such time.

3.1.2 _Copies_. TopCo shall, prior to filing a Registration Statement or
prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration, and such
holders legal counsel, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed to
be filed, each amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in
each case, including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein), the prospectus included in such Registration Statement
(including each preliminary prospectus), and such other documents as the
holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration or legal
counsel for any such holders may request in order to facilitate the

3.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. TopCo shall prepare and file with the
Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in

Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or such securities have
been withdrawn (the "Effectiveness Period").

3.1.4 _Notification_. After the filing of a Registration Statement,
TopCo shall promptly, and in no event more than three (3) Business Days after
such filing, notify the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement of such filing, and shall further notify such holders

 Business Days of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) when such
Registration Statement becomes effective; (ii) when any post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the
issuance or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and TopCo
shall take all actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to
remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for any
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any prospectus
relating thereto or for additional information or of the occurrence of an
event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement any such
supplement or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission
a Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, including documents incorporated by reference, TopCo shall furnish to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
and to the legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such holders
and legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such documents and
comment thereon.

 

3.1.5 _Securities Laws Compliance_. TopCo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement (in light of their intended plan
of distribution) may reasonably request and (ii) take such action necessary
to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to
be registered with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may
be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of TopCo and do any and
all other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the
holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; provided, however, that TopCo shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify but for this paragraph or subject itself to taxation in
any such jurisdiction.

3.1.6 _Agreements for Disposition_. TopCo shall enter into customary
agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement in customary
form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities. The
representations, warranties and covenants of TopCo in any underwriting
agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any Underwriters, to the
extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the benefit of the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement, and
the representations, warranties and covenants of the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such registration statement in any underwriting
agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any Underwriters, to the
extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the benefit of TopCo.

 



13

    

3.1.7 _Comfort Letter_. In the event of an Underwritten Takedown or an
Underwritten Demand Registration, TopCo shall obtain a "cold comfort" letter
from TopCos independent registered public accountants in the event of an
underwritten offering, and a customary "bring-down" thereof, in customary form
and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort"
letters, as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and reasonably
satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating holders. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 3.17_ shall not apply to Block
Trades.

 

3.1.8 _Opinions and Negative Assurance Letters_. In the event of an
Underwritten Takedown or an Underwritten Demand Registration, on the date the
Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to any Registration,
TopCo shall obtain an opinion and negative assurances letter, each dated such
date, of one (1) counsel representing TopCo for the purposes of
such Registration, including an opinion of local counsel if applicable,
addressed to the holders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the
Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with respect to such
Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the holders,
placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably request and as are
customarily included in such opinions, and reasonably satisfactory to a
majority in interest of the participating holders. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 3.18_ shall not apply to Block Trades.

3.1.9 _Cooperation_. The principal executive officer of TopCo, the principal
financial officer of TopCo, the principal accounting officer of TopCo and all
other officers and members of the management of TopCo shall cooperate fully in
any offering of Registrable Securities hereunder, which cooperation shall

with respect to such offering and all other offering materials and related
documents, and participation in meetings with Underwriters, attorneys,
accountants and potential investors.

3.1.10 _Transfer Agent_. TopCo shall provide and maintain a transfer agent
and registrar for the Registrable Securities.

3.1.11 _Records_. Upon execution of confidentiality agreements, TopCo shall

disposition pursuant to such registration statement and any attorney,
accountant or other professional retained by any holder of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement or any Underwriter, all
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of
TopCo, as shall be necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause TopCos officers, directors and employees to supply
all information requested by any of them in connection with such Registration
Statement.

 

3.1.12 _Earnings Statement_. TopCo shall comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission and the Securities Act, and make available to

3.1.13 _Road Show_. If an offering pursuant to this Agreement is conducted as
an Underwritten Takedown or Underwritten Demand Registration and involves
Registrable Securities with an aggregate offering price (before deduction of
underwriting discounts) exceeds $[50,000,000], TopCo shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in such offering.

 

3.1.14 _Listing_. TopCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement to be listed on
such exchanges or otherwise designated for trading in the same manner as
similar securities issued by TopCo are then listed or designated.

 

3.2 _Obligation to Suspend Distribution_. Upon receipt of any notice from
TopCo of the happening of any event of the kind described in  _Section_ __ _
3.1.4(iv)_, or, upon any suspension by TopCo, pursuant to a written insider
trading compliance program adopted by the TopCo Board, of the ability of all
"insiders" covered by such program to transact in TopCos securities because
of the existence of material non-public information, each holder of
Registrable Securities included in any registration shall immediately
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until such holder
receives the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by _Section_ __ _
3.1.4(iv)_ or the restriction on the ability of "insiders" to transact in
TopCos securities is removed, as applicable, and, if so directed by TopCo,
each such holder will deliver to TopCo all copies, other than permanent file
copies then in such holders possession, of the most recent prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.
The foregoing right to delay or suspend may be exercised by TopCo for no
longer than 180 days in any consecutive 12-month period.

3.3 _Registration Expenses_. TopCo shall bear all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the Resale Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to

Registration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, and all expenses incurred in
performing or complying with its other obligations under this Agreement,
whether or not the Registration Statement becomes effective, including,
without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees; (ii) fees and
expenses of compliance with securities or "blue sky" laws (including fees and
disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the
Registrable Securities); (iii) printing expenses; (iv) TopCos internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its
officers and employees); (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the listing of the Registrable Securities as required by _Section_ __ _
3.1.12_; (vi) Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fees; (vii) fees and
disbursements of counsel for TopCo and fees and expenses for independent
certified public accountants retained by TopCo; (viii) the fees and expenses
of any special experts retained by TopCo in connection with such registration;
and (ix) the reasonable fees and expenses of one legal counsel selected by the
holders of a majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities included in
such registration not to exceed $62,500. TopCo shall have no obligation to pay
any underwriting discounts or selling commissions attributable to the
Registrable Securities being sold by the holders thereof, which underwriting
discounts or selling commissions shall be borne by such holders, but TopCo
shall pay any underwriting discounts or selling commissions attributable to
the securities it sells for its own account.

 



15

    

3.4 _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall promptly
provide such information as may reasonably be requested by TopCo, or the
managing Underwriter, if any, in connection with the preparation of any
Registration Statement, including amendments and supplements thereto, in order
to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities
Act and in connection with TopCos obligation to comply with Federal and
applicable state securities laws.

 

3.5 _Other Obligations_. At any time and from time to time after the
expiration of any lock-up to which such shares are subject, if any, in
connection with a sale or transfer of Registrable Securities exempt from
registration under the Securities Act or through any broker-dealer
transactions described in the plan of distribution set forth within any
prospectus and pursuant to the Registration Statement of which such prospectus
forms a part, TopCo shall, subject to the receipt of customary documentation
required from the applicable holders in connection therewith, (i) promptly
instruct its transfer agent to remove any restrictive legends applicable to
the Registrable Securities being sold or transferred and (ii) cause its legal
counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if any, to the transfer agent
in connection with the instruction under subclause (i). In addition, TopCo
shall cooperate reasonably with, and take such customary actions as may
reasonably be requested by such holders in connection with the aforementioned
sales or transfers.

 

4\. _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_.

4.1  _Indemnification by TopCo_. TopCo agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
each Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities, and each of
their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors, partners,
members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any, who controls an
Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) (each,
an "Investor Indemnified Party"), from and against any expenses, losses,
judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, arising
out of or based upon any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of
such Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon any omission (or
alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation
by TopCo of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder applicable to TopCo and relating to action or inaction required of
TopCo in connection with any such registration; and TopCo shall promptly
reimburse the Investor Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Investor Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating and defending any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage,
liability or action; provided, however, that TopCo will not be liable in any
such case to the extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or
liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or allegedly
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration
Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or
any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished to TopCo, in writing, by such selling holder expressly
for use therein, or is based on any selling holders violation of the federal
securities laws (including Regulation M) or failure to sell the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the plan of distribution contained in the
prospectus.

 



16

    

4.2 _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each selling
holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any Registration is
being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement of any
Registrable Securities held by such selling holder, indemnify and hold
harmless TopCo, each of its directors and officers, and each other selling
holder and each other person, if any, who controls another selling holder
within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims,
judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such
losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or allegedly
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement
under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon
any omission or the alleged omission to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, if
the statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to TopCo by such selling holder expressly for
use therein, or is based on any selling holders violation of the federal
securities laws (including Regulation M) or failure to sell the
Registrable Securities in accordance with the plan of distribution contained
in the prospectus, and shall reimburse TopCo, its directors and officers, and
each other selling holder or controlling person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation
or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling
holders indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint
and shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by
such selling holder.

4.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt by any
person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Sections 4.1_ or _4.2_ ,
such person (the "Indemnified Party") shall, if a claim in respect thereof is
to be made against any other person for indemnification hereunder, notify such
other person (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the loss, claim,
judgment, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the failure by
the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to
such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnified
Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought
against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes,
jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control of the defense
thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that
in any action in which both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
are named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel, which counsel
is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) to represent

 



17

    

 the Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be subject to
liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought
by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the fees and
expenses of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if, based upon
the written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party, representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party shall,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry
of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could
have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
Indemnified Party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim or proceeding.

4.4 _Contribution_.

 

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing _Sections 4.1_ ,
_4.2_ and _4.3_ is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as
a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties and
the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which
resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of any Indemnified
Party and any Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such Indemnified Party or such Indemnifying Party and
the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 4.4.1_.

4.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_, no holder of
Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of
the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any underwriting
fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by such holder from
the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such contribution
obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



18

    

5\. _UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION_.

 

5.1 _Rule 144_. TopCo covenants that it shall file any reports required to be
filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and shall take such
further action as the holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders
to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities
Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.

 

6\. _LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS_.

 

6.1 _Investor Lock-Up_3. Each Investor agrees that such Investor shall not
Transfer any TopCo Ordinary Shares or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for TopCo Ordinary Shares
(including New Securities) for 180-days following the Closing Date (the
"Lock-up Period"). The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude
each Investor during such 180-day period from engaging in any hedging or other
transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead
to or result in a sale or disposition of such Investors TopCo Ordinary
Shares even if such TopCo Ordinary Shares would be disposed of by someone
other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions
during such 180-day period would include without limitation any short sale or
any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including, without limitation, any
put or call option) with respect to any of the Investors TopCo Ordinary
Shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives
any significant part of its value from such Ordinary Shares. The foregoing
notwithstanding, each executive officer and director of the Company shall be
permitted to establish a plan to acquire and sell TopCo Ordinary Shares
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, provided that such plan does
not provide for the Transfer of TopCo Ordinary Shares during the Lock-up
Period. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to Transfers made: (i)
pursuant to a _ bona fide_ gift or charitable contribution; (ii) by will or
intestate succession upon the death of an Investor; (iii) to any Permitted
Transferee; (iv) pursuant to a court order or settlement agreement related to
the distribution of assets in connection with the dissolution of marriage or
civil union; or (v) in the event of TopCos completion of a liquidation,
merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of
its shareholders having the right to exchange their TopCo ordinary shares for
cash, securities or other property; provided that in the case of (i) or (iii),
the recipient of such Transfer must enter into a written agreement agreeing
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including the transfer
restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

 





   3  |

shares of TopCo issued in respect of shares issued prior to the closing date
of the Business Combination Agreement, for the period ending on the earlier of
(A) one year after the completion of ARYAs initial Business Combination or
(B) subsequent to the Business Combination, (x) if the closing price of the
Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share
splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the
like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at
least 150 days after ARYAs initial Business Combination or (y) the date on
which ARYA completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar
transaction that results in all of ARYAs shareholders having the right to
exchange their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property.

7\. _BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CONSENT RIGHT_.

 

7.1 _ARYA Directors_. Until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of
this Agreement, at each annual or special meeting of shareholders of TopCo,
ARYA Investors who represent a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities held by all ARYA Investors shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to designate for election as a director of TopCo, and the TopCo
Board (including any committee thereof) shall nominate (and recommend for
election and include such recommendation in a timely manner in any proxy
statement, consent solicitation or other applicable announcement to TopCos
shareholders) two individuals to serve on the TopCo Board (one Class I
Director and one Class III Director); provided, however, that if any time
during such five-year period, ARYA Investors collectively own less than []%
of the TopCo Ordinary Shares but more than []% of the TopCo Ordinary Shares
(in each case, as adjusted for any share split, share dividend or other share
recapitalization, share exchange or other event), the foregoing will apply
only to one individual to serve as a Class I Director of TopCo, and if at any
time during such five-year period ARYA Investors collectively own less than
[]% of the TopCo Ordinary Shares (as adjusted for any share split,
share dividend or other share recapitalization, share exchange or other
event), the rights of ARYA Investors and obligations of the TopCo Board under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall terminate. The directors designated pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ may, but do not need to, qualify as
"independent" pursuant to the listing standards of Nasdaq. For the avoidance
of doubt, the individuals designated by the ARYA Investors to serve on the
TopCo Board shall serve on the "supervisory board" of TopCo, at such time as
the TopCo Board is structured as a "two-tier" board; on such date as the TopCo
Board is reorganized to be structured as a "one-tier" board pursuant to
Section [] of the TopCo Articles of Association in effect on the date hereof
(the " _Board Structure Provision_ ") and the individuals designated by the
ARYA Investors to serve on the TopCo Board shall continue as directors of
TopCo without any further action by the ARYA Investors.

7.2 _ARYA Director Vacancies_. Each Investor agrees to vote, or cause to be
voted, all TopCo Ordinary Shares owned by such Investor, or over which such
Investor has voting control, from time to time and at all times, in whatever
manner as shall be necessary to ensure that: (a) no director elected pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ may be removed from office, unless: (i) such removal
is directed or approved by the affirmative vote of ARYA Investors entitled
under  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ to designate such director; or (ii) ARYA
Investors are no longer entitled to designate TopCo directors pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_; and (b) any vacancies created by the resignation,
removal or death of a director elected pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall
be filled pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7_. TopCo and the
TopCo Board shall take all actions necessary to fill such vacancy with such
replacement director promptly upon written notice to TopCo of the name of such
replacement director by ARYA Investors entitled under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ to
designate such director.

 

7.3 _Dievini Directors_. Until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of
this Agreement, at each annual or special meeting of shareholders of TopCo,
_Dievini_ shall have the right, but not the obligation, to designate for
election as a director of TopCo, and the TopCo Board (including any committee
thereof) shall nominate (and recommend for election and include such
recommendation in a timely manner in any proxy statement, consent solicitation
or other applicable announcement to TopCos shareholders) two individuals to
serve on the TopCo Board (one Class I Director and one Class III Director);
provided, however, that if any time during such five-year period, Dievini owns
less than []% of the TopCo Ordinary Shares but more than []% 

 



20

    

 of the TopCo Ordinary Shares (in each case, as adjusted for any share split,
share dividend or other share recapitalization, share exchange or other
event), the foregoing will apply only to one individual to serve as a Class I
Director of TopCo, and if at any time during such five-year period Dievini
owns less than []% of the TopCo Ordinary Shares (as adjusted for any share
split, share dividend or other share recapitalization, share exchange or
other event), the rights of Dievini and obligations of the TopCo Board under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall terminate. The directors designated pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ may, but do not need to, qualify as
"independent" pursuant to the listing standards of Nasdaq. For the avoidance
of doubt, the individuals designated by Dievini to serve on the TopCo Board
shall serve in accordance with the Board Structure Provision and the
individuals designated by Dievini to serve on the TopCo Board shall continue
as directors of TopCo without any further action by Dievini.

 

7.4 Dievini _Director Vacancies_. Each Investor agrees to vote, or cause to be
voted, all TopCo Ordinary Shares owned by such Investor, or over which such
Investor has voting control, from time to time and at all times, in whatever
manner as shall be necessary to ensure that: (a) no director elected pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ may be removed from office, unless: (i) such removal
is directed or approved by the affirmative vote of Dievini entitled under
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to designate such director; or (ii)Dievini is no longer
entitled to designate TopCo directors pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_; and
(b) any vacancies created by the resignation, removal or death of a director
elected pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall be filled pursuant to the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7_. TopCo and the TopCo Board shall take
all actions necessary to fill such vacancy with such replacement director
promptly upon written notice to TopCo of the name of such replacement director
by Dievini entitled under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to designate such director.

7.5 _Indemnification_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
request of any director designated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, TopCo shall enter into an indemnification agreement with
the director, in the form entered into with the other members of the TopCo
Board or, if not entered into by other members of the TopCo Board, a customary
form. TopCo shall pay the reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such director related to his or her service to TopCo, including
attending meetings of the TopCo Board or any committee or sub-committee
thereof or events attended on behalf of TopCo or any of its subsidiaries at
TopCos request. For so long as a director designated pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.1_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ serves as a director of TopCo, TopCo shall
not amend, alter or repeal any right to indemnification or exculpation
covering or benefiting any director designated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ as and to the extent consistent with applicable
law, including but not limited to under the articles of association of TopCo
(except to the extent such amendment or alteration permits TopCo to provide
broader indemnification or exculpation rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto). TopCo shall (i) purchase directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount determined by the TopCo Board to be
reasonable and customary and (ii) for so long as any director designated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ serves as a director
of the TopCo Board, maintain such coverage with respect to such director;
provided __ that upon removal or resignation of such director for any reason,
TopCo shall take all actions reasonably necessary to extend such directors
and officers liability insurance coverage for a period of not less than six
(6) years from any such event in respect of any act or omission occurring at
or prior to such event.

 



21

    

7.6 _Consent Right_. None of TopCo, the TopCo Board or any of the Company
Investors shall take any action to amend or repeal the Board Structure
Provision without the express written consent of a majority in interest of the
ARYA Investors. The right provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall be
of no further force or effect upon the adoption by TopCo of a "one-tier"
board structure on the one-year anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

 

8\. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

8.1 _Other Registration Rights and Arrangements_. TopCo represents and
warrants that no person, other than a holder of the Registrable Securities has
any right to require TopCo to register any of TopCos share capital for sale
or to include TopCos share capital in any registration filed by TopCo for
the sale of shares for its own account or for the account of any other person.
The parties hereby terminate the Prior Agreement, which shall be of no further
force and effect and is hereby superseded and replaced in its entirety by
this Agreement. TopCo shall not hereafter enter into any agreement with
respect to its securities which is inconsistent with or violates the rights
granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement and in the
event of any conflict between any such agreement or agreements and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

 

8.2 _Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the rights,
duties and obligations of TopCo hereunder may not be assigned or delegated by
TopCo in whole or in part. This Agreement and the rights, duties and
obligations of the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder may be freely
assigned or delegated by such holder of Registrable Securities in
conjunction with and to the extent of any permitted transfer of Registrable
Securities by any such holder. This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns and the holders of Registrable
Securities and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any persons that
are not party hereto other than as expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4_
and this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_. The rights of a holder of Registrable
Securities under this Agreement may be transferred by such a holder to a
transferee who acquires or holds Registrable Securities; provided, however,
that such transferee has executed and delivered to TopCo a properly completed
agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement substantially in form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (an "Addendum Agreement"), and the transferor
shall have delivered to TopCo no later than thirty (30) days following the
date of the transfer, written notification of such transfer setting forth the
name of the transferor, the name and address of the transferee, and the
number of Registrable Securities so transferred. The execution of an Addendum
Agreement shall constitute a permitted amendment of this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of TopCo and the
Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities at
the time in question, which majority shall include ARYA Investors who hold a
majority in interest of the Registrable Securities held by all ARYA Investors
at the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions, covenants and
conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of such
provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified; provided,
however, that
