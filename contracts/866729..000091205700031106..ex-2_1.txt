3.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS.

      3.1   ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.

            (a) PART 3.1 OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER contains a complete and
accurate list for each Acquired Company of its name, its jurisdiction of
organization, other jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business and
its capitalization. Except as set forth on PART 3.1 OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER,

good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with full
corporate power and corporate authority to conduct its business as it is now
being conducted, to own or use the properties and assets that it purports to own
or use, and to perform all its obligations under its agreements. Each U.S.
Acquired Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and
is in good standing under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which
either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or the nature
of the activities conducted by it, requires such qualification, except where the
failure to do so, individually or taken as a whole, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect and would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

            (b) Except as set forth in Part 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Letter,
Sellers have made available to Buyer copies of the Organizational Documents of
each Acquired Company, as currently in effect.

      3.2   AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICT.

            (a) This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, and binding
obligation of Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in accordance with its terms
subject to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or an action at law). Sellers have full corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform their obligations under this
Agreement.

            (b) Except as set forth in PART 3.2 OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation or
performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions by Sellers will:

                  (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of (A)
      any provision of the Organizational Documents of any of the Sellers or the
      Acquired Companies, or (B) any resolution adopted by the board of
      directors or the stockholders of any of the Sellers or any Acquired
      Company;

                  (ii) to the Knowledge of the Sellers and subject to compliance
      with HSR, contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of, or give
      any Governmental Body the right to challenge any of the Contemplated
      Transactions or to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief under any
      Legal Requirement to which any Acquired Company is subject; or

                  (iii) contravene or result in a violation or breach of any
      provision of, or give any Person the right to terminate or modify any
      Material Contract or any Order to which any Acquired Company is subject.

      Except as set forth in PART 3.2 OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER, and except where
the failure to do so, individually or taken as a whole, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect and would not be reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Sellers nor any of the Acquired Companies
is or will be required to give any notice to or obtain any Consent from any
Person in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions.

      3.3 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized equity securities of the Company
consist of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of which 100
shares are issued and outstanding and constitute the Shares. Seller is and will
be on the Closing Date the record and beneficial owner and holder of the Shares,
free and clear of all Encumbrances. Except as set forth in PART 3.3 OF THE
DISCLOSURE LETTER and except for nominee shares, as required under local laws,
all of the outstanding equity securities and other securities of each Acquired
Company are owned of record and beneficially by one or more of the Acquired
Companies, free and clear of all Encumbrances. All of the outstanding equity
securities of each Acquired Company have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any
preemptive rights. Except as set forth in PART 3.3 OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER,
there

financial statements, all in accordance with GAAP.

      3.5 TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ENCUMBRANCES. PART 3.5 OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER

reports, surveys and other due diligence reports, or in Sellers' materials

the Ordinary Course of Business, incurred any material liabilities or
obligations of any nature since December 31, 1999.

            (c) With respect to each "EMPLOYEE PENSION BENEFIT PLAN," as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA, in which a U.S. Acquired Company, or any ERISA
Affiliate participates or has participated at any time in the last five years,
(i) none of the U.S. Acquired Companies, or any ERISA Affiliate has filed a
notice of intent to terminate any such employee pension benefit plan or adopted
any amendment to treat any such employee pension benefit plan as terminated,
(ii) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has not instituted or

with respect to each Benefit Plan, (i) each Benefit Plan intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the IRC (or to the Knowledge of the Sellers, similar
provisions for plans of non-United States jurisdictions) has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS (or, if applicable, has received
similar approval or Government Authorization from a foreign Government Body)
and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, nothing has occurred or is expected to

any penalty or tax liability, (ii) there is no pending, threatened or, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, anticipated claim (other than any non-material routine

Sellers, with respect to each Benefit Plan that is funded primarily or partially
through an insurance policy, no Acquired Company has any liability in the nature
of retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or
contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring on or
before the Closing Date. Except as set forth in PART 3.9(d) OF THE DISCLOSURE
LETTER, the fair market value of the assets of any Benefit Plan maintained by an
Acquired Company would not exceed such Acquired Company's liability to such
Benefit Plan if such Plan were to be terminated as of the Closing Date.

            (e) The U.S. Acquired Companies have complied in all material
respects with the requirements of Part 6 of Title 1 of ERISA. Except as set
forth in PART 3.9(e) OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER, the U.S. Acquired Companies (and,
to the Knowledge of the Sellers, any non-U.S. Acquired Company) have no
obligation to provide medical, health, death or other welfare benefits to any of
its current or prior employees or any other person other than while an employee
of the Acquired Companies, except as specifically required by Part 6 of Title 1
of ERISA.

            (f) Except as set forth in PART 3.9(f) OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER, the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, either alone or in combination
with any termination of employment, will not (i) entitle any individual to
severance pay or any similar payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount, of any compensation or benefits due to any
individual or (iii) directly result in any payment made or to be made to or on
behalf of any person to constitute a "PARACHUTE PAYMENT" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the IRC.

            (g) Except as set forth in PART 3.9(g) OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER,
with respect to any Benefit Plan, (i) no filing, application, audit,
investigation or other matter is pending with the IRS, the PBGC, the United
States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Body, and (ii) there are no
outstanding liabilities for taxes, penalties or fees (except for fees payable to
third parties in the ordinary course for administrative service to a Benefit
Plan or Plans).

            (h) Except as set forth in PART 3.9(h) OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER,
with respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to the provisions of Title I,
Subtitle B, Part 3 of ERISA, (i) the actuarial present value (based on the
actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation) of vested and
nonvested "BENEFIT LIABILITIES," as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA
(calculated on a funding basis using actuarial assumptions under Section 412 and
calculated as required by the PBGC on a plan termination basis), of each such
Benefit Plan, determined as of the most recent valuation date for each such
Benefit Plan, did not exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Benefit
Plan as of such date, and



                                       15
<PAGE>

(ii) since the most recent valuation date for each such Benefit Plan, there has
been no amendment or change to such Benefit Plan that would increase the amount
of benefit liabilities thereunder and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there
has been no event or occurrence that would materially increase or decrease the
value of such assets or liabilities.

            (i) To the Knowledge of the Sellers, with respect to each scheme or
arrangement mandated by a Government Body outside of the United States and with
respect to each Benefit Plan maintained or contributed to by any Acquired
Company in respect of individuals employed outside of the United States
("FOREIGN BENEFIT PLAN"), the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan
funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Foreign
Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to provide
for the accrued liabilities, as of the date of this Agreement, to all current
and former participants in such Foreign Benefit Plan according to the applicable
actuarial assumptions and valuations, if any, most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan.

            (j) No Acquired Company has failed to provide coverage under any
Benefit Plan to any individual who should have been covered under such Plan
under applicable law.

      3.10 COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. Except (a) for any noncompliance

this Section 3 (it being the intention of the parties that any such
noncompliance, if it exists, will be governed, if at all, by such other
representations and warranties specifically related thereto), (b) as set forth
in PART 3.10 OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER or (c) when failure to do so would not
have a Material Adverse Effect and is not reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect:

                  (i) each Acquired Company is, and at all times since January
      1, 1997 has been, in compliance with each Legal Requirement that is or was
      applicable to the ownership or use of any of its assets;

                  (ii) no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (A)
      would constitute or result in a violation by any Acquired Company of, or a
      failure on the part of any Acquired Company to comply with, any Legal
      Requirement, or (B) would give rise to any obligation on the part of any
      Acquired Company to undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost
      of, any remedial action of any nature; and

                  (iii) no Acquired Company has received, at any time since
      January 1, 1997, any written notice from any Governmental Body regarding
      any actual or alleged violation of, or failure to comply with, any Legal
      Requirement.

Representatives of Seller as Seller may designate. The Seller shall cause each
Acquired Company to make available to Representatives of the Buyer during such
period all such information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs
of such Acquired Company as such Representatives may reasonably request, and

to consummate the Contemplated Transactions (including all filings under the HSR

any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act). Sellers shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain the consents specified in Part 3.2 of the

Sellers will promptly notify Buyer in writing if Sellers or any Acquired Company
becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a material
breach of any of Seller's representations and warranties as of the date of this
Agreement, or if such Seller or any Acquired Company becomes aware of the
occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that would
(except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a
material breach of any such representation or warranty had such representation
or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition. Should any such fact or condition require any change in the
Disclosure Letter if the Disclosure Letter were dated the date of the occurrence
or discovery of any such fact or condition, Seller will promptly deliver to
Buyer a supplement to the Disclosure Letter specifying such change. During the
same period, Seller will promptly notify Buyer of the occurrence of any breach

respect to the Shares and one or more U.S. Acquired Companies, Buyer shall
notify Seller

jointly make an express election under IRC Section 338(h)(10) with respect to
each U.S. Acquired Company other than Grolier Overseas, Incorporated and, at
Buyer's election, any analogous state election or any express election under
state law that would result in the treatment of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as a sale by such Acquired Company of its assets rather than as a
sale of the shares of such Acquired Company. Buyer and Seller will report any
transactions that occur under this Agreement consistent with the Section
338(h)(10) Election, and will take no position contrary thereto. Buyer shall not
make any election under IRC Section 338 with respect to Grolier Overseas,
Incorporated, or with respect to any entity that is not a U.S. Acquired Company.

relevant Subsidiaries shall be reasonable and prepared in accordance with IRC
Section 338. Buyer and Seller shall agree on the allocation of the MADSP among
the assets of the Company and each of its relevant Subsidiaries (the

parties hereto shall prepare and file such forms as may be required under
Section 1060 of the IRC in a manner consistent therewith.

            (c) Seller and Buyer shall each provide to the other all necessary
information to permit the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be made. Buyer shall be
responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms or documents required to
be filed with any taxing authority in connection with (including, without
limitation, IRS Form 8023) the Section 338(h)(10) Election (the "SECTION 338
FORMS"). Within five (5) months after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall
execute IRS Form(s) 8023 and any forms required to make any elections under
state or local law that are analogous to a Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller
shall execute and deliver to Buyer any other documents or forms as Buyer
reasonably requires to complete properly the Section 338 Forms. Seller hereby
authorizes Buyer to file the Section 338 Forms and any other forms referred to
in the preceding sentence with the appropriate taxing authorities at Buyer's
election, and Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of such Section 338 Forms
after such Section 338 Forms are filed with the appropriate taxing authorities.
Buyer and Seller agree to prepare and file all Tax Returns on a basis consistent
with any Section 338(h)(10) Election (or, if such election is made and is not
available under any state or local income tax law, on a basis consistent with
any election available under such law that is analogous to an election under IRC
Section 338(g)) and with an allocation of the MADSP that is consistent with the
Allocation of MADSP provided for in paragraph (b) of this Section 7.

            (d) Seller shall calculate the gain or loss, if any, resulting from
the Section 338(h)(10) Election in a manner consistent with the determination of
MADSP and the Allocation and shall not take any position inconsistent with the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, the MADSP or the Allocation in connection with any
Tax Return or otherwise. Seller shall pay all federal, state and local income
and franchise Taxes resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and in the
event that Buyer or the Acquired Companies pay



                                       28
<PAGE>

such Taxes, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the Acquired
Companies from and against all such Taxes and reasonable costs and fees incurred
in connection therewith.

            (e) Buyer shall determine its tax basis for the assets of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with the
determination of MADSP and the Allocation and shall not take any position
inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the MADSP or the Allocation
in any Tax Return or otherwise.

8.    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO BUYER'S OBLIGATION TO CLOSE.

      Buyer's obligation to purchase the Shares and to take the other actions
required to be taken by Buyer at the Closing is subject to the satisfaction, at
or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions (any of which may
be waived by Buyer, in whole or in part):

      8.1   ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS.

            All of Seller's representations and warranties in this Agreement
(considered collectively), and each of these representations and warranties
(considered individually), must have been accurate in all material respects as
of the date of this Agreement, and must be accurate in all material respects as
of the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
representation and warranties (considered collectively), or any representation
or warranty (considered individually) will not be deemed to be inaccurate in all
material respects for purposes of this Section 8.1 unless such inaccuracy is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of
determining the fulfillment of the condition precedent set forth in this Section
8.1 or determining whether the aggregate amount of Damages referred to in
Section 11.4 has been reached, no supplement to the Disclosure Letter shall be
given effect; provided that the Buyer's consummation of the Closing shall
constitute without any further action on the part of the Buyer, a waiver by the
Buyer of its right to require satisfaction of the condition precedent set forth
in this Section 8.1, but shall not be deemed to preclude or restrict any claim
by the Buyer for indemnification pursuant to Section 11 if Sellers do not, as
provided in clauses (i) or (ii) of the following sentence, determine that a New
$15 Million Claim (as defined below) has arisen. If Sellers determine in their
reasonable judgment that any disclosure required by Section 5.4 is (i) with
respect to a matter that arises after the date hereof or (ii) with respect to a
matter that arose prior to the date hereof but of which Sellers did not have
Knowledge prior to the date hereof, and is reasonably likely to give rise to a
claim by Buyer for indemnification against the Sellers under Section 11.1 in an
amount in excess of $10 million (after giving effect to the limitation specified
in Section 11.4 of this Agreement, I.E., $15 million of Damages would result in
an indemnification claim of $10 million after giving effect to the limitation of
Section 11.4) (a "NEW $15 MILLION CLAIM"), Sellers shall have the right to
notify Buyer in writing of said determination ("Sellers' Section 8.1 Notice")
and require Buyer to make an election either to (a) terminate the Agreement or
(b) waive its right to use the disclosure as a failure to satisfy its conditions
to close, which shall automatically constitute a waiver of its right to make a
claim for indemnification against Sellers with respect to any matters so
disclosed. Buyer must notify Seller of its election on the later of (x) five
business days after its receipt



                                       29
<PAGE>

of Sellers' notice and (y) two business days prior to the scheduled Closing
Date. Buyer will be deemed to have made the election specified in clause (b)
above if it does not deliver the notice specified in the preceding sentence in a
timely manner. The parties agree that the threshold amount that gives rise to
Sellers' right to require Buyer to make said election shall not be construed as
evidence for determining the meaning of "material" or "materiality" under any
provision of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the terms "material
amounts" or "materiality" for the purposes of this Agreement may contemplate
amounts less than or greater than $15 million.

      8.2   SELLER'S PERFORMANCE.

            (a) All of the covenants and obligations that Seller is required to
perform or to comply with pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to the Closing
(considered collectively), and each of these covenants and obligations
(considered individually), must have been duly performed and complied with in
all material respects.

            (b) Each document required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.4
must have been delivered, and each of the other covenants and obligations in
Sections 5.2 and 5.3 must have been performed and complied with in all respects.

      8.3 CONSENTS. Each of the Consents identified in PART 3.2 OF THE
DISCLOSURE LETTER as Required Consents must have been obtained and must be in
full force and effect.

      8.4 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS. An opinion of Edward Kabak, General Counsel to
the Company, dated the Closing Date, and an opinion of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman,
Hays & Handler, LLP, counsel to the Sellers, dated the Closing Date, must have
been delivered to Buyer and be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
Buyer's counsel.

      8.5 NO PROCEEDINGS. There must not be in effect any Legal Requirement or
any injunction or other Order that prohibits the sale of Shares by Seller to
Buyer.

9.    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SELLER'S OBLIGATION TO CLOSE.

      Seller's obligation to sell the Shares and to take the other actions
required to be taken by Seller at the Closing is subject to the satisfaction, at
or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions (any of which may
be waived by Seller, in whole or in part):

      9.1 ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS. All of Buyer's representations and
warranties in this Agreement (considered collectively), and each of these
representations and warranties (considered individually), must have been
accurate in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and must be

material respects.

            (b) Buyer must have delivered each of the documents required to be

      9.4 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS. An opinion of Charles Deull, Senior Vice
President and General Counsel of Buyer, dated the Closing Date must have been

Seller's counsel.

      9.5 NO INJUNCTION. There must not be in effect any Legal Requirement or
any injunction or other Order that prohibits the sale of the Shares by Seller to
Buyer.

                  (i) Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax
      Returns due to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date and all U.S.
      Federal, state and local income and franchise Tax Returns with respect to
      the Acquired Companies with respect to the taxable periods ending on or
      before the Closing Date.

                  (ii) Buyer shall file or cause to file when due all other Tax

            (b) FOREIGN TAX RECEIPTS. Buyer shall deliver to the tax director of
Seller certified copies of all receipts for any foreign Tax paid with respect to

foreign Taxes paid by Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies after the Closing
Date), and any other documentation required in connection with Seller or any of
its Affiliates claiming or supporting a claim for such foreign tax credits
promptly following a request by Seller for such receipts or documentation.



                                       31
<PAGE>

            (c) CONTEST PROVISIONS. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receipt by Buyer, of notice of any pending or threatened audits or
assessments with respect to Taxes which may affect the liabilities for Taxes of
Seller. Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the defense of
and, at its option, take control of the complete defense of, Seller's interests
in any tax audit or administrative or court proceeding (a "CONTEST") relating to
such Taxes, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. Buyer may not
agree to settle any claim for such Taxes without the prior written consent of
Seller which may not be unreasonably withheld. With respect to any Contest as to
which Seller either has taken control of the defense pursuant to this Section
9.6(c) or controls pursuant to Section 11.6, Seller agrees (i) to keep Buyer
informed of this progress of such Contest, (ii) to consult with Buyer and to
consider in good faith Buyer's reasonable request with respect to the conduct of
such Contest, and (iii) to notify Buyer of any action taken or proposed to be
taken from time to time by Seller with respect to such Contest.

            (d)   CERTAIN POST-CLOSING SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS.

                  (i) BUYER'S CLAIMING, RECEIVING OR USING OF REFUNDS AND
      OVERPAYMENTS. If, after the Closing, Buyer or its Affiliates (A) receive
      any refund, or (B) utilize the benefit of any overpayment, of Taxes which
      were paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates (as determined at the time
      such Taxes were paid), Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be
      transferred, to Seller the entire amount of the refund or overpayment
      (including interest) received or utilized as a credit by Buyer or its
      Affiliates. Buyer agrees to notify Seller promptly of both the discovery
      of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any
      such refund or utilization as a credit of any such overpayment. Buyer
      agrees to claim any such refund or to utilize as a credit any such
      overpayment and to furnish to Seller all information, records and
      assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

                  (ii) BUYER'S CLAIMING AND REALIZING OF TAX BENEFITS IN RESPECT
      OF INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES. If, after the Closing, (A) Buyer or its
      Affiliates realizes any loss for which it is indemnified by Seller
      pursuant to this Agreement, or (B) an adjustment is required by any taxing
      authority in any item reflected on a Tax Return for which Seller is
      obligated to indemnify any party hereunder, Buyer and its Affiliates
      agree, as soon as possible, to claim any such loss and recognize any such
      adjustment on their Tax Returns and claim to the fullest extent possible
      all deductions available as a result of any such loss or adjustment. Buyer
      agrees to furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance
      necessary to verify the amount of the decrease, if any, in Buyer and its
      Affiliate's cumulative income and franchise Taxes paid (as compared to the
      cumulative income and franchise Taxes Buyer and its Affiliates would
      otherwise have paid) as a result of recognizing such loss or adjustment
      and claiming all such available deductions. Buyer shall promptly transfer,
      or cause to be transferred, to Seller an amount equal to the entire amount
      of such decrease at the time such decrease is realized, whether realized
      by Buyer and its Affiliates paying less income and franchise Taxes,
      receiving a refund or otherwise utilizing a credit.

            (e) POST-CLOSING ACTIONS WHICH AFFECT SELLER'S LIABILITY FOR TAXES.

      elections under comparable provisions of state or local Tax law (which the
      parties agree will be governed by Section 7 hereof), Buyer shall not
      permit any Acquired Company to take any action after the Closing Date
      which could materially increase Seller's liability for Taxes (including
      any liability of Seller to indemnify Buyer for Taxes pursuant to this
      Agreement).

                  (ii) Except to the extent required by law, Buyer or its
      Affiliates shall not, without prior written consent of Seller, amend any
      Tax Return filed by, or with respect to, any Acquired Company for any
      taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning before the Closing Date.

            (f) TERMINATION OF TAX ALLOCATION AGREEMENTS. Any agreement or
arrangement with respect to the allocation or sharing of Taxes, whether or not
written, that may have been entered into by Seller and any Acquired Company
shall be terminated as to Seller and any Acquired Company as of the Closing
Date, and no payments which are owed by any party pursuant thereto shall be made
thereunder.

      taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns and payments in respect
      thereof;

      reasonably requested all relevant information, records, and documents
      relating to Taxes;

      information request with respect to any Taxes referred to in subsection
      (D) above; and

            (F) bear the other party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
      complying with a request by a party for the other party's assistance or
      cooperation to the extent that those expenses are attributable to fees and
      other costs of unaffiliated third-party service providers.

<PAGE>

            (h) Taxes Attributable to Pre-Closing Reorganization. Seller agrees

any compensation provided therefor by Buyer).

      10.1 TERMINATION EVENTS. This Agreement may, by notice given prior to or
at the Closing, be terminated:

            (a) by either Buyer or Seller if a material breach of any provision
of this Agreement has been committed by the other party and such breach has not
been waived;

            (b) (i) by Buyer if any of the conditions contained in the first
sentence of Section 8.1 or in Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 or 8.5 has not been
satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition is or
becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Buyer to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement) and Buyer has not waived such condition on or
before the Closing Date; or (ii) by Seller, if any of the conditions in Section
9 has not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a
condition is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Seller to
comply with their obligations under this Agreement) and Seller has not waived
such condition on or before the Closing Date;

            (c)   by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller;

            (d) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing has not occurred (other

2000, or such later date as the parties may agree upon; or

            (e) by Buyer if it elects to terminate after receipt of a Sellers'
Section 8.1 Notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.1.

      10.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Each party's right of termination under
Section 10.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement
or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be an election
of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, all
further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except
that the obligation in Section 10.3 will survive; provided, however, that if
this Agreement is terminated by a party because of the breach of the Agreement
by the other party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating
party's



                                       34
<PAGE>

obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other
party's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the
terminating party's right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired provided that Buyer shall have no rights against Sellers
in the event Buyer elects to terminate pursuant to Section 10.1(e).

      10.3 BREAKUP FEE. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(a) above, or if Buyer terminates this Agreement for any reason other than a
reason permitted under Section 10.1, Buyer shall be required to pay Seller a
termination fee equal to $20 million. Such payment shall be made by wire
transfer, in immediately available funds, no later than 48 hours after receipt
by Buyer of Seller's notice, or in the case of a termination by Buyer,
concurrent with Buyer's notice to Seller.

11.   INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES.

      11.1 INDEMNIFICATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY SELLERS. Sellers will
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Acquired Companies,
and their respective stockholders, controlling persons, and affiliates
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") for, and will pay to the Indemnified
Persons the amount of, any loss, liability, claim, damage (excluding incidental
and consequential Damages) and expense (including reasonable costs of
investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively,

liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to any representation
or warranty (other than the representations and warranties contained in Sections
3.7, 3.9, 3.15 and with respect to claims based on intentional misrepresentation
or fraud) or covenant or obligation to be performed and complied with prior to
the Closing Date unless on or before the expiration of 21 months after the

                                       35
<PAGE>

factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by
Buyer. If the Closing occurs, Buyer will have no liability (for indemnification
or otherwise) with respect to any representation or warranty, or covenant or
obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, unless
on or before the expiration of 21 months after the Closing Date, Seller notifies
Buyer of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail
to the extent then known by Seller. With respect to claims based on
misrepresentations contained in Section 3.7 and relating to matters for which a
reserve has been taken as referenced in PART 3.7(e) OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER,
Sellers shall have no liability unless Buyer notifies Sellers of such claim, in
the manner specified above, on or before the third anniversary of the Closing
Date. With respect to claims based on misrepresentations contained in Section
3.7 and relating to Taxes other than for matters for which a reserve has been
taken as referenced in PART 3.7(e) OF THE DISCLOSURE LETTER, Sellers shall have
no liability unless Buyer notifies Sellers of such claim, in the manner
specified above, no later than six months after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any extensions thereof). With respect to
claims based on misrepresentations contained in Sections 3.9 and 3.15, Sellers

      11.4 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT -- SELLER. Seller will have no liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters described in clause

the Sellers under Section 7(d) and 9.6(h)) until the total of all Damages with
respect to such matters exceeds $5,000,000, and then only for the amount by
which such Damages exceed $5,000,000. Seller will have no liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters described in clause
(a) or clause (b) of Section 11.1 in excess of $100 million of the Purchase
Price.

      11.5 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT -- BUYER. Buyer will have no liability (for

exceed $5,000,000.

      11.6  PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION -- THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

            (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section
11.1 or 11.2 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such
indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party
under such Section, or, if the indemnified party believes it is reasonably
likely that a claim will be made against an indemnifying party under Section
11.1 or 11.2, give notice to the indemnifying party of the assertion or
reasonable likelihood of assertion of such claim, but the failure to notify the
indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that
it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the
indemnified party's failure to give such notice.

            (b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 11.6(a) is brought
against an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of
the commencement of such Proceeding, the



                                       36
<PAGE>

indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to
the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to
such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity
to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such
Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory
to the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be
liable to the indemnified party under this Section 11 for any fees of other
counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in
each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in
that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no
compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying
party without the indemnified party's consent unless (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights
of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will
have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the
commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within ten
days after the indemnified party's notice is given, give notice to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or
any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume at its expense the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such
Proceeding, but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of
a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its

      12.1 EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
each party to this Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expenses of agents,
representatives, counsel, and accountants. In the event of termination of this
Agreement, the obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be subject
to any rights of such party arising from a breach of this Agreement by another
party.

      12.2 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Except as may be required by law, any public
announcement or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions will be issued, if at all, at such time and in such
manner as agreed by Seller and Buyer. Neither party shall issue any press
release or written statement for general circulation relating to this Agreement
or the Contemplated Transactions unless approved in advance by the other party,
which approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. Seller and Buyer
will consult with each other concerning the means by which the Acquired
Companies' employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings with
the Acquired Companies will be informed of the Contemplated Transactions.

      12.3 CONFIDENTIALITY. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, Buyer and Sellers will maintain in confidence, and will cause the
directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors of Buyer and Sellers and
the Acquired Companies to maintain in confidence, and not use to the detriment
of another party or an Acquired Company any written, oral, or other information
obtained in confidence from another party or an Acquired Company in connection
with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, unless (a) such
information is already known to such party or to others not bound by a duty of
confidentiality or such information becomes publicly available through no fault
of such party, (b) the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in
making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (c) the furnishing or use of such
information is required by or necessary in connection with legal proceedings or
(d) to financing sources, financial analysts and investors and rating agencies
if such disclosure is customary and appropriate for a publicly traded company.
The foregoing confidentiality obligations shall continue to apply to Sellers for
a period of three years following the Closing Date.

      If the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated, each party will
return or destroy all written information provided by the other party.

      12.5 JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS. Any action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement
may be brought against any of the parties in the courts of the State of New
York, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District




                                       39
<PAGE>

Court for the Southern District of New York, and each of the parties consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any
such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein.
Process in any action or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be
served on any party anywhere in the world.

      12.6 FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to
each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other
party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement. In addition, Sellers
agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions, if requested
by Buyer, to cause the transfer to Buyer of any nominee shares of the Acquired
Companies to such Person or Persons as Buyer may request. Seller also agrees to
request that its accounting firm cooperate with Buyer in Buyer's preparation of
any financial information that Buyer is required to include in its public
filings. The fees and expenses charged by such accounting firm for such work
shall be the responsibility of Buyer.

      12.7 WAIVER. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party
in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right,
power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power,
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power,
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged
by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or
right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be
given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it
is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such
notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

      12.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter and
constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete
and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with
respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a
written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

      12.9 DISCLOSURE LETTER. In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Letter
(other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Letter
with respect to a specifically identified representation or warranty), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

      12.10 ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. Neither party
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of
the other parties, except that Buyer may



                                       40

assign to any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries or its parent without consent.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in
all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted
assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will
be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any
legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

      12.11 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

      12.12 SECTION HEADINGS, CONSTRUCTION. The headings of Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction
or interpretation. All references to "Section" or "Sections" refer to the
corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement. All words used in this
Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances
require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not
limit the preceding words or terms.

      12.13 TIME OF ESSENCE. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

      12.14 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the
State of New York applicable to agreements entered into and to be fully
performed in that state.

      12.15 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

      12.16 NON-COMPETITION. Sellers will not, directly or indirectly, compete
for a period of three (3) years from the Closing in the businesses of direct
marketing of children's book clubs, collectibles, card clubs, reference material
and educational products.
