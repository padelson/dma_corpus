                 of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the right to

                 on or after Closing).

         2.1.3   The Seller shall procure that on or prior to Closing any and

                 minority holdings in any Group Companies are transferred to
                 such persons as the Purchasers shall nominate.

3        Consideration

3.1      Amount

         3.1.1   The aggregate consideration for the purchase of the Shares
                 under this Agreement shall be an amount equal to
                 'L'31,133,000 million (the "Consideration") subject to
                 adjustment in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 3.1
                 and Clause 6.

         3.1.2   If the Closing Intra-Group Debt exceeds the Provisional
                 Intra-Group Debt, the Consideration shall be reduced by the
                 excess.

         3.1.3   If the Closing Intra-Group Debt is less than the Provisional
                 Intra-Group Debt, the Consideration shall be increased by the
                 shortfall.

         3.1.4   If the Closing Financial Borrowings exceed the Provisional
                 Financial Borrowings, the Consideration shall be reduced by the
                 excess.

         3.1.5   If the Closing Financial Borrowings are less than the
                 Provisional Financial Borrowings, the Consideration shall be
                 increased by the shortfall.

                 and paid by the Purchasers to the Seller in accordance with
                 Clause 6. Any reduction or increase of the Consideration
                 pursuant to this Clause shall be deemed to adjust the
                 allocation set out in Schedule 1, to take account of the
                 changes in the amounts payable or receivable by each Group
                 Company at Closing compared with such amounts included when
                 estimating the Provisional Intra-Group Debt and Provisional
                 Financial Borrowings.

                 Agreement or pursuant to an indemnity under any such agreement
                 or the Tax Indemnity, the payment shall be made by way of
                 adjustment of the consideration paid by the relevant Purchaser
                 for

                 (i)  the payment and/or claim relates to the shares in more
                      than one Group Company, it shall be allocated in a manner
                      which reflects the impact of the matter to which the
                      payment and/or claim relates, failing which it shall be
                      allocated rateably to the shares in the Group Companies
                      concerned by reference to the proportions in which the

                      3.1.1; or

                 (ii) the payment and/or claim relates to no particular shares
                      in any Group Company, it shall be allocated rateably to

                      the consideration is allocated in accordance with Clause
                      3.1.1,

                 and in each case the consideration shall be deemed to have been
                 reduced by the amount of such payment.

                     is held and permit the Purchasers and their representatives
                     access to such facilities and such of the Seller's
                     accountants' working papers as are necessary for the
                     Purchasers to understand how inventories are taken and
                     permit an inventory to be undertaken at each facility at
                     Closing (and for such purpose shall on request allow

         given by or binding on the Group Companies in relation to any debt or
         obligation of any of the Seller's Group (other than the Group

                 pay to the Seller as additional Consideration an amount equal
                 to that shortfall.

         All such amounts shall be settled in ('L') pounds, provided that
         the obligations of the Seller and the Purchasers under this clause to
         repay consideration or pay additional consideration, shall be satisfied

         promissory note issued pursuant to Clause 6.3.

6.12     Wrong Pocket

         Without affecting the other specific terms of this Agreement, and,

         6.12.1  any assets (including, without limitation, contracts) or rights
                 of the Group (other than Intellectual Property) had prior to
                 Closing been used by or are required in the course of (or, in
                 the case of contracts, related to) the business of the Seller's
                 Group as at Closing (which for the avoidance of doubt excludes
                 the Eyecare Business); or

         6.12.2  any assets (including, without limitation, contracts) or rights
                 of the Seller's Group (other than Intellectual Property) had

                 (or, in the case of contracts, related to) the Eyecare Business
                 but are not part of the assets owned by the Group,

         the parties will use their reasonable endeavours to agree a means and
         reasonable commercial terms by which such use or benefit by the
         Purchaser's Group or the Seller's Group, as the case may be, may
         continue with respect to relevant assets or rights as long as
         reasonably necessary and practicable or by which such assets or rights
         may be transferred to or by the Seller's Group by or to the Group (as
         appropriate).

         With regard to any assets, property or rights transferred pursuant to
         Clause 6.12:

         6.13.1  if transferred to the Purchasers' Group, such assets, property
                 or rights will be deemed to have been owned by the Group
                 Companies immediately prior to completion of this Agreement;

         6.13.2  if transferred to the Seller's Group, such assets, property or
                 rights will be deemed to have been owned by the Group Companies
                 immediately prior to Completion of this Agreement.; and

         6.13.3  the Seller shall indemnify the Purchasers against any Tax
                 suffered by any Group Company in respect of any income profits
                 or gains earned or received or deemed for Tax purposes to be
                 earned or received from the Seller's Group by the Group Company
                 in respect of such arrangements.

         6.15.1  The Purchasers shall procure that as soon as practicable
                 following Closing there shall be drawn up a draft of the Net
                 Asset Statement (the "Draft Net Asset Statement") in accordance
                 with Schedule 6.

         6.15.2  The Draft Net Asset Statement as agreed or determined pursuant
                 to paragraph 3 of Schedule 6:

                 (i)  shall constitute the Net Asset Statement for the purposes
                      of this Agreement; and

                 (ii) shall be final and binding on the parties.

         6.15.3  If:

                 (i)  the Net Assets attributable to the Group Companies are
                      less than 'L'15 million, the Seller shall repay to the
                      relevant Purchasers an amount equal to the deficit of Net
                      Assets below the 'L'15 million; or

                 (ii) the Net Assets attributable to the Group Companies exceed
                      'L'15 million, the relevant Purchasers shall pay to the
                      Seller an additional amount equal to the excess of Net
                      Assets over 'L'15 million provided that that amount does
                      not exceed the Adjustment Amount,

                 such payments to be made on or before 15 Business Days after
                 the date on which the process described in paragraph 3 of
                 Schedule 6 for the preparation of the Net Asset Statement is
                 complete.

6.16     After Closing, the Purchasers will, in consultation with the Seller
         design a programme to refurbish all or some of the 23 off DAC 3 axis
         lathes (the "DAC 3's") at a cost to the Seller of US$250,000. Upon
         completion of such a programme, the Seller and the Purchasers will seek
         to agree to the appointment of an independent expert (and, in default
         of agreement within 14 days of the initial attempt to agree the
         identity of such an expert either party may request the President of
         the Institute of Mechanical Engineers to make such an appointment) who
         shall carry out a manufacturing review to determine whether, in his
         opinion, the DAC 3s on the basis of standard regular maintenance
         provided by the Purchasers will in each of the following 3 years
         produce satisfactory product at 80% of the previous years level of
         output. If such an expert determines that the DAC 3s will not or will
         likely not produce at such level, the Seller shall be obliged to pay
         the Purchasers a further $100,000 towards the cost of a further
         upgrade.

         "Executive Scheme") and rule 6(e) of the Employee Share Option Scheme
         (the "Employee Scheme") to extend the period during which Relevant
         Employees may exercise any UK Inland Revenue approved share options
         held under the Executive Scheme and the Employee Scheme by the period
         required to ensure that no charge to income tax arises on the exercise

               (vi)   in respect of competition/anti-trust are those contained
                      in paragraphs 16.1 to 16.4 of Schedule 7 and each of the
                      other Seller's Warranties shall be deemed not to be given
                      in respect of such matters.

         8.1.3 The Seller acknowledges that the Purchasers have entered into
               this Agreement in reliance upon the Seller's Warranties.

         8.1.4 Each of the Seller's Warranties shall be separate and independent
               and shall not be limited by reference to any other paragraph of
               Schedule 7.

         8.1.5 Any Seller's Warranty qualified by the expression "so far as the
               Seller is aware" or any similar expression shall, unless
               otherwise stated, be deemed to refer to the actual knowledge of
               the persons whose names are set out in Schedule 9. In these
               circumstances, one or more of the persons listed in Schedule 9
               has made all reasonable enquiries of persons who would be
               expected to know the circumstances the subject of any Warranty so
               qualified and has caused such persons to make due and careful
               enquiries as to the relevant matters.

         8.1.6 The Seller undertakes to use its reasonable endeavours to procure
               that if the Seller's Warranties were repeated each day up to
               Closing they would remain true and accurate.

8.2      Seller's Disclosures

         8.2.1 The Sellers' Warranties are subject to the following matters:

               (i)    any matter which is fairly disclosed in this Agreement or
                      the Disclosure Letter; and


                                      -19-





<PAGE>


               (ii)   all matters which are fairly disclosed in the documents
                      sent to the Purchaser's Lawyers and listed in the
                      Disclosure Letter at Appendix A.

         8.2.2 References in the Disclosure Letter to paragraph numbers shall be
               to the paragraphs in Schedule 7 to which the disclosure is most
               likely to relate. Such references are given for convenience only
               and shall not limit the effect of any of the disclosures, all of
               which are made against the Sellers' Warranties as a whole.

8.3      Notification

         8.3.1 If after the signing of this Agreement:

               (i)    the Seller shall become aware that any of the Sellers'
                      Warranties was untrue or inaccurate in any material
                      respect as of the signing of this Agreement; or

               (ii)   any event shall occur or matter shall arise of which the
                      Seller becomes aware which results or may result in any of
                      the Sellers' Warranties being untrue or inaccurate in any
                      material respect up to Closing, had the Sellers'
                      Warranties been repeated up to Closing,

               the Seller shall notify the US Purchaser in writing as soon as
               practicable and in any event prior to Closing setting out such
               details as are available and the Seller shall make any
               investigation concerning the event or matter, at its own
               reasonable cost, as the US Purchaser may reasonably require.

         8.3.2 Any notification pursuant to Clause 8.3.1 shall not operate as a
               disclosure pursuant to Clause 8.2 of this Agreement and the
               Sellers' Warranties shall not be subject to such notification.

8.4      Termination/ Rescission

         If the Purchaser becomes aware at any time (whether it does so by
         reason of any disclosure made in the Disclosure Letter or not) that

         8.4.1 there has been any breach of the warranties or any other term of
               this Agreement; or

         8.4.2 after the date hereof an event arises or circumstances exist
               which would have constituted a breach of the Seller's warranties
               had the same been repeated each day after the date hereof up to
               Closing,

         the Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate or rescind this Agreement
         or treat this Agreement as terminated or rescinded PROVIDED ALWAYS that

               (i)    prior to the satisfaction of the condition in Clause 4.1,
                      such breach is of such a material nature that it severely
                      prejudices the Group's ability to supply significant
                      product lines with core powers after Closing; and

               (ii)   after satisfaction of the condition in Clause 4.1, such
                      breach would justify the Purchasers acting reasonably in
                      seeking to reduce their valuation of the Group Companies
                      (on a debt free basis) by 50 per cent.

8.5      Undertakings to pay

         If any of the Seller's Warranties is breached or untrue or misleading,
         the Seller undertakes to the Purchasers (without restricting the rights
         of the Purchasers or any remedy they may have on any other basis
         available to them) to pay to the relevant Purchaser the aggregate of:


                                      -20-






<PAGE>


         8.5.1 the amount by which the value of any asset of any Group Company
               (excluding for this purpose any asset which is of immaterial
               value (monetary or operational) to that Group Company, (including
               any asset warranted to exist which does not exist) is or becomes
               less than it would have been if the Seller's warranties had not
               been breached or untrue or misleading;

         8.5.2 an amount equal to any other loss or liability suffered or
               incurred by the Purchasers, and/or any Group Company as a result
               of any Seller's warranty being breached or untrue or misleading;
               and

         8.5.3 all costs, expenses and disbursements suffered or reasonably
               incurred by the Purchasers and/or any Group Company as a result
               of any warranty being breached or untrue or misleading.

8.6      The Purchasers' Warranties

         Each of the Purchasers warrants to the Seller that the statements set
         out in Schedule 8 in respect of each of them are true and accurate.

9        Limitation of the Seller's Liability

9.1      Time Limitation for Claims

         Save as provided in Clauses 11.2, 11.3.1, 11.3.2 and 11.7 the Seller
         shall not be liable under this Agreement in respect of any claim unless
         a notice of the claim is given by the relevant Purchaser to the Seller
         specifying the matters set out in Clause 10.2:

         9.1.1 in the case of any warranty claim relating to Tax, within six
               years after the end of the accounting period in which Closing
               occurs

         9.1.2 in the case of any other claim, not later than 30 June 2003.

9.2      Minimum Claims

         The Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement or the Tax
         Indemnity in respect of any individual claim (or a series of claims
         arising from substantially identical facts or circumstances) where the
         liability agreed or determined (disregarding the provisions of this
         Clause 9.2) in respect of any such claim or series of claims does not
         exceed 'L'10,000.

9.3      Aggregate Minimum Claims

         9.3.1 Subject to Clause 9.3.3, the Seller shall not be liable under
               this Agreement or the Tax Indemnity in respect of any claim
               unless the aggregate amount of all claims for which the Seller
               would otherwise be liable under this Agreement and the Tax
               Indemnity (disregarding the provisions of this Clause 9.3)
               exceeds 'L'750,000.

         9.3.2 Where the amount agreed or determined in respect of all claims
               referred to in Clause 9.3.1 exceeds 'L'750,000, the Purchasers
               shall be entitled to claim the whole amount of the claims and not
               merely the excess.

         9.3.3 The provisions of clause 9.3.1 shall not apply to any claim
               relating to indemnities set out at clause 11.3 or the
               Environment.

         liability which is contingent unless and until such contingent

         ALWAYS that the time limitations set out in Clause 9.1, where relevant,
         shall be extended to permit the relevant Purchaser to make such a claim
         when the liability becomes actual and the Seller shall remain liable
         notwithstanding the provisions of that clause.

9.6      Provisions

         The Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement in respect of any
         claim if and to the extent that proper allowance, provisions or reserve

         claim.

9.7      Matters Arising Subsequent to this Agreement

         Provided that this clause shall not apply to the Environmental
         Indemnity, the Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement in
         respect of any matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any
         combination thereof), including the aggravation of a matter or

         same would not have occurred but for:

         9.7.1   Agreed matters

                 any matter or thing done or omitted to be done pursuant to and

                 writing of either or both of the Purchasers;

         9.7.2   Acts of Purchaser

                 any act, omission or transaction (a) outside of the ordinary

                 Purchaser's Group or any of the Group Companies, or their
                 respective directors, officers, employees or agents or
                 successors in title, after Closing, or (b) in the ordinary
                 course of business of any such company where the Company
                 concerned knows, or should reasonably be aware, that any such
                 act, omission or transaction might give rise to a liability or
                 loss relevant for the purpose of this Clause 9.7;

         9.7.3   Changes in legislation

                 (i)  the passing of, or any change in, after the date of this

                      practice of any government, governmental department,
                      agency or regulatory body including (without prejudice to
                      the generality of the foregoing) any increase in the rates
                      of Taxation or any imposition of Taxation or any
                      withdrawal of relief from Taxation not actually (or
                      prospectively) in effect at the date of this Agreement; or

                 (ii) any change after the date of this Agreement of any

         9.7.4   Accounting and Taxation Policies

                 any change in accounting or Taxation policy, bases or practice

                 having effect after Closing.

9.8      Insurance

         The Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement or the Tax
         Indemnity in respect of any claim to the extent that the Losses
         (including any Environmental Losses) in respect of which such claim is
         made are covered by a policy of insurance in force at the date of this
         Agreement or would have been covered if the policy was maintained after
         Closing.

9.9      Net Financial Benefit

         The Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement or the Tax
         Indemnity in respect of any Losses (including any Environmental Losses)
         suffered by the Purchaser or any of the Group Companies to the extent
         of any corresponding savings by or net quantifiable financial benefit
         to the Purchaser or any Group Company arising from such Losses (for
         example, without limitation, where the amount (if any) by which any
         Taxation for which the Purchaser or any Group Company would otherwise
         have been accountable or liable to be assessed is actually reduced or
         extinguished as a result of the matter giving rise to such liability).

9.10     Mitigation of Losses

         The Purchasers shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken and
         all reasonable assistance is given to avoid or mitigate any Losses
         (including any Environmental Losses) which in the absence of mitigation
         might give rise to a liability in respect of any claim under this
         Agreement.

9.11     Purchasers' Right to Recover

         9.11.1  Recovery for Actual Liabilities

                 The Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement unless and
                 until the liability in respect of which the claim is made has
                 become due and payable.

         9.11.2  Prior to Recovery from the Seller etc.

                 If, before the Seller pays an amount in discharge of any claim
                 under this Agreement, the Purchaser or any Group Company
                 recovers or is entitled to recover (whether by payment,
                 discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) from a third
                 party a sum which indemnifies or compensates the Purchasers or
                 Group Company (in whole or in part) in respect of the loss or
                 liability which is the subject matter of the claim, the
                 Purchasers shall procure that, before steps are taken to
                 enforce a claim against the Seller following notification under
                 Clause 10.2 of this Agreement or the Environmental Indemnity,
                 all reasonable steps are taken to enforce such recovery from
                 such third party and any actual recovery (less any reasonable
                 costs incurred in obtaining such recovery) shall reduce or
                 satisfy, as the case may be, such claim to the extent of such
                 recovery. The Seller shall be subrogated to all rights that the
                 relevant Purchaser has or would otherwise have in respect of
                 the claim against the third party.

         9.11.3  Following Recovery from the Seller etc.

                 If the Seller has paid an amount in discharge of any claim
                 under this Agreement and the Purchasers or any Group Company
                 subsequently is entitled to recover (whether by payment,
                 discount, credit, relief,


                                      -23-





<PAGE>


                 insurance or otherwise) from a third party a sum which
                 indemnifies or compensates the relevant Purchaser or Group
                 Company (in whole or in part) in respect of the loss or
                 liability which is the subject matter of the claim, the
                 relevant Purchaser shall pay, or procure that the Group Company
                 pays, to the Seller an amount equal to (i) the sum recovered
                 from the third party less any reasonable costs and expenses
                 incurred in obtaining such recovery; or (ii) if less, the
                 amount previously paid by the Seller to the relevant Purchaser.

9.12     Double Claims

         The Purchasers shall not be entitled to recover from the Seller under
         this Agreement or the Tax Indemnity more than once in respect of the
         same Losses (including Environmental Losses) suffered and, without
         prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Seller shall not be
         liable in respect of:

         9.12.1  any breach of the Agreement if and to the extent that the
                 Losses resulting from or connected with such breach are or have
                 been included in a claim under the Tax Indemnity which has been
                 satisfied; or

         9.12.2  a claim under the Tax Indemnity if and to the extent that the
                 Losses in respect of which such claim was made are or have been
                 included in a claim for breach of this Agreement which has been
                 satisfied.

9.13     Fraud

         None of the limitations contained in this Clause 9 shall apply to any
         claim which arises or is increased, or to the extent to which it arises
         or is increased, as the consequence of, or which is delayed as a result
         of, fraud by the Seller, any Group Company or any of their respective
         directors, officers, employees or agents.

10       Claims

10.1     Notification of Potential Claims

         If either of the Purchasers becomes aware of any matter or circumstance
         that it appreciates will give rise to a claim against the Seller under
         this Agreement, the relevant Purchaser shall within 30 days give a
         notice in writing to the Seller setting out such information as is
         available to the relevant Purchaser as is reasonably necessary to
         enable the Seller to assess the merits of the claim, to act to preserve
         evidence and to make such provision as the Seller may consider
         necessary provided that by so doing the best interests of the Eyecare
         Business are not prejudiced thereby. Without prejudice to the
         provisions of Clause 9.12 the Purchasers' failure to comply with the
         provisions of this Clause 10.1 shall not be a pre-condition of the
         Purchasers' ability to recover from the Seller under the terms of this
         Agreement.

10.2     Notification of Claims under this Agreement

         Notices of claims under this Agreement shall be given by the relevant
         Purchaser to the Seller within the time limits specified in Clause
         10.1, specifying in reasonable detail the legal and factual basis of
         the claim and the evidence on which the party relies and, if
         practicable, an estimate of the amount of Losses which are, or are to
         be, the subject of the claim (including any Losses which are contingent
         on the occurrence of any future event).

10.3     Commencement of Proceedings

         Any claim notified pursuant to Clause 10.2 shall (if it has not been
         previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be deemed to be withdrawn
         twelve months after the notice is given pursuant to Clause 10.2 unless
         legal proceedings in respect of it have been commenced by being both
         validly issued and served.

10.4     Procedure for Third Party Claims

         If the claim notified pursuant to Clause 10.1 is a result of or in
         connection with a claim by or liability to a third party then:

         10.4.1  no admissions in relation to such third party claim shall be
                 made by or on behalf of the Purchasers or any other member of
                 the US Purchaser's Group and the claim shall not be
                 compromised, disposed of or settled without the prior written
                 consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
                 or delayed);

         10.4.2  the Seller shall be entitled at its own expense, by notice in
                 writing to the Purchasers, to take such action as it shall deem
                 necessary to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal,

<PAGE>


                 (i)    The Seller will indemnify, and keep indemnified, the UK
                        Purchaser in respect of Losses equal to an amount paid
                        by the UK Purchaser or any Group Company to the trustees
                        of the Hydron Pension Scheme in accordance with Section
                        75 Pensions Act 1995 (or any legislation replacing it).
                        In the event the trustees make more than one statutory
                        demand under Section 75, the UK Purchaser or any Group
                        Company concerned shall immediately notify the Seller in
                        writing of such additional demands before making any
                        payment. If so instructed by the Seller, the UK
                        Purchaser or Group Company shall not make any payment
                        towards such additional statutory demands. If this
                        results in a claim by the trustees seeking to compel
                        such a payment then, subject to Clause 10.4 (Procedure
                        for Third Party Claims) the UK Purchaser or the relevant
                        Group Company will resist the claim but shall not make
                        any admission, compromise, or settle the claim without
                        the Seller's written consent. The Seller shall reimburse
                        the UK Purchaser or Group Company for any amounts
                        reasonably incurred in defending such a claim by the
                        trustees. Clause 9.7.3 (Changes in legislation) shall
                        not apply to this Clause 11.3.1(i).

                 (ii)   The Seller shall not be liable under this clause in
                        respect of any claim unless a notice specifying the
                        amount paid to the trustees and a copy of the actuary's
                        certificate is received before the third anniversary of
                        Closing.

                 (iii)  The UK Purchaser shall use all reasonable endeavours to
                        procure that the trustees of the Hydron Pension Scheme
                        complete the wind-up in a timely fashion.

         11.3.2  The Seller will indemnify the UK Purchaser against 75 per cent
                 of the overall administration costs (which will be limited to
                 costs reasonably and necessarily incurred by the UK Purchaser
                 or any Group Company for legal, actuarial and administrator
                 expenses) relating to the winding up of the Hydron Pension
                 Scheme. In this respect, the UK Purchaser will provide a
                 schedule of all such costs to the Seller on a quarterly basis
                 and payment shall be made within 30 days of receipt of this,
                 unless this amount is disputed, in which case payment shall be
                 made 30 days after the parties agree on the amount to be paid.
                 The obligation in this sub-clause shall not be subject to
                 Clause 9.2;

         11.3.3  The Seller shall indemnify, and keep indemnified, the UK
                 Purchaser and/or the US Purchaser in respect of any Losses
                 reasonably incurred by either the US Purchaser or the UK
                 Purchaser or any Group Company in relation to pension or life
                 assurance benefits (or similar benefits) payable in respect of
                 service with the Group Company prior to Closing outside the
                 United Kingdom or in relation to any legal non-compliance of
                 any pension scheme (or similar scheme) outside the United
                 Kingdom prior to Closing.

         11.3.4  The Seller shall indemnify, and keep indemnified, the UK

                 UK Purchaser or any Group Company in connection with any legal
                 non-compliance of the UK Pension Schemes prior to Closing.

         11.3.5  In the event that the UK Purchaser, the US Purchaser or any
                 Group Company obtains for the accounting period in which any
                 amounts paid under Clauses 11.3.1, 11.3.2, 11.3.3 or 11.3.4 are
                 paid or in any of the four succeeding accounting periods a
                 deduction for the amount paid which results in a reduction in
                 taxable profits for the purpose of Corporation Tax, then the UK
                 Purchaser or the US Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the
                 amount by which the amount paid reduces those taxable profits
                 multiplied by the marginal rate of tax applicable to the UK
                 Purchaser, the US Purchaser or the Group Company obtaining the
                 deduction for the accounting period in which the deduction is

11.4     Liabilities

         If and to the extent that there are:

         11.4.1  current or contingent liabilities of the Group Companies at
                 Closing which are not provided for in the Net Asset Statement;
                 or

         11.4.2  (without prejudice to the generality of Clause 11.4.1)
                 liabilities of the Group Companies under any contracts existing
                 at Closing the terms of which have not been fairly disclosed in
                 the Disclosure Letter

         the Seller shall indemnify the Purchasers to the extent of such
         unprovided liabilities (but in the case of any contingent liability,
         only to the extent of the actual liability when the liability ceases to
         be contingent) or, in relation to contracts which have not been so
         disclosed, the cost of complying with or terminating the same.

         This provision shall not however apply to liabilities in respect of the
         acquisition by or provision to the Companies or any of them following
         Closing of any asset, service or other benefit which, having regard to
         the Purchasers' plans for the integration of the Eyecare Business into
         its existing business, will provide an asset, service or other benefit
         to the Purchasers' Group commensurate with the amount of the liability
         incurred by the relevant Group Company to obtain such asset service or
         other benefit.

11.5     Slow Moving Stock

         On the anniversary of Closing, the Purchasers shall prepare and submit
         to the Seller an analysis of the extent to which in the preceding 12
         months provisions (including write-offs) made in the Net Asset
         Statement for slow moving stock (disregarding for this purpose Proclear
         Compatibles and Proclear Compatibles Toric and any corresponding
         provision) have proved to be excessive/inadequate on a parameter by
         parameter basis and to the extent that such an analysis demonstrates
         that there was an excess the Purchasers shall promptly repay an equal
         sum to the Seller by way of additional consideration for the Shares and
         to the extent that such an analysis demonstrates that there was an
         inadequacy the Seller shall promptly repay an equal sum to the
         Purchasers by way of a reduction in the consideration. The Purchasers
         shall promptly provide to the Seller all such information to the Seller
         as the latter may reasonably request to verify the analysis and the
         Seller shall not be liable to make any payment to the Purchasers until
         such analysis has been verified to its satisfaction by its auditors. If
         the analysis cannot be so verified within 28 days of its submission to
         the Seller, the Seller may refer the analysis to an independent firm of
         accountants appointed jointly by the Seller and the Purchasers and
         whose decision in this matter shall (in the absence of manifest error)
         be final and binding.

11.6     Italian Lease
         The Seller shall indemnify the UK Purchaser on behalf of the relevant
         Group Company against any liability and/or costs arising from the
         termination of the property lease entered into in January 2002 by
         Hydron SRL.

11.7     Litigation

         The Seller shall indemnify the Purchasers and the Group Companies
         against any costs reasonably incurred by them and/or any liability
         arising in respect of the litigation referred to in paragraph 5.2.4 of
         the Disclosure Letter and the Purchasers and the Group Companies shall
         use their reasonable endeavours to assist the Seller to minimise its
         liability under this indemnity.

                 (v)    the information becomes publicly available (other than
                        by breach of the Confidentiality Agreement or of this
                        Agreement);

                 (vi)   the other party has given prior written approval to the
                        disclosure or use; or

                 (vii)  the information is independently developed after
                        Closing,

                 provided that prior to disclosure or use of any information
                 pursuant to Clause 12.2.2(i), (ii) or (iii), the party
                 concerned shall promptly notify the other parties of such
                 requirement with a view to providing the other parties with the
                 opportunity to contest such disclosure or use or otherwise to
                 agree the timing and content of such disclosure or use.

13       Restrictions on Business Activities

13.1     Restrictions on Seller

         As further consideration for the Purchasers purchasing the Shares and
         with the intent of assuring to the Purchasers the full benefit and
         value of the goodwill, know-how and connections of the Group and as a
         constituent part of the sale of the Shares the Seller undertakes to
         procure that each member of the Seller's Group will not, either alone
         or in conjunction with or on behalf of any other person, do any of the
         following things:

         13.1.1  neither pending nor within three years after Closing, be
                 engaged or (except as the holder of shares in a listed company
                 which confer not more than five per cent. of the votes which
                 could normally be cast at a general meeting of the company)
                 directly or indirectly interested in carrying on any business
                 which competes with the Eyecare Business as carried on at
                 Closing;

         13.1.2  neither pending nor within one year after Closing, solicit the

13.2     Separate Undertakings

         Each undertaking contained in this Clause 13 shall be construed as a
         separate undertaking and if one or more of the undertakings is held to
         be against the public interest or unlawful or in any way an
         unreasonable restraint of trade, the remaining undertakings shall
         continue to bind the Seller. Nothing in Clause 13.1 shall prevent the
         Seller from employing any person who responds to a general solicitation
         for applicants for employment (not aimed at employees of the Group

                 (ii)   shall forthwith hand to the Seller duly certified copies
                        of the special resolutions or other documents effecting

                 Purchasers shall not, and shall procure that no member of the
                 Purchasers' Group shall thereafter adopt, use or carry on
                 business under any name incorporating the words
                 "Biocompatibles" or "BCP" or any words resembling the same
                 provided always that nothing shall prevent any Group Company at
                 any time after Closing selling products constituting stocks of
                 the products at Closing notwithstanding the fact that the
                 relevant packaging containing such products uses such words and
                 the Purchasers shall use reasonable endeavours to use up such
                 stocks as quickly as practicably possible.

         13.3.3  Subject to sub-clause 13.3.4, the Group Companies shall be
                 permitted following Closing:

                        under (ii) or (iii) below for so long as such products
                        are within their shelf-life;

                 (ii)   to use packaging which has already been printed prior to
                        Closing for the purpose of packaging stock for a period
                        of six months following Closing;

                 (iii)  to have printed additional packaging which is the same
                        as packaging which has been printed prior to Closing

                        such additional packaging for a period of six months
                        following Closing.

                 all loss, damage or liability (including legal costs on an
                 indemnity basis) on an after-tax basis which any of them may
                 suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with any claim
                 which may be brought against them by any third party or any
                 financial penalty or fine imposed:

                 (i)    as a consequence of any of the following not being in
                        accordance with good industry practice and to standards
                        and procedures consistent with those used and applied by
                        the Group Companies prior to Closing;

                        (a) the storage, handling and other dealing with
                            packaged stock in existence as at Closing; or

                        (b) the storage, handling and other dealing with stock
                            in existence as at Closing which is subsequently

                 (ii)   in relation to products manufactured after Closing and
                        sold or otherwise disposed of by any of the Group
                        Companies using either packaging printed prior to
                        Closing or additional packaging which is the same as
                        such packaging.

         13.3.5  No admissions in relation to a third party claim shall be made
                 by or on behalf of the Indemnified Parties and the claim shall
                 not be compromised, disposed of or settled without the prior
                 written consent of the Purchasers.

         13.3.6  The Purchaser shall be entitled at its own expense and in its
                 absolute discretion, by notice in writing to the Indemnified
                 Parties, to take such action as it shall deem necessary to
                 avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal, compromise or
                 contest such claim or liability (including, without limitation,

         and all obligations which would otherwise arise on termination in
         relation to any such sub-licences shall terminate.

14       Guarantee

14.1     In consideration of the Seller entering into this Agreement, the US
         Purchaser hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
         Seller the due and punctual performance and observance by the UK
         Purchaser of all of its obligations, commitments and undertakings under
         or pursuant to this Agreement and the Tax Indemnity. The liability of
         the US Purchaser under this Clause shall not be released or diminished
         by any variation of the terms of this Agreement or the Tax Indemnity
         (whether or not agreed by the US Purchaser), any forbearance, neglect
         or delay in seeking performance of the obligations hereby imposed or
         any granting of time for such performance.

14.2     If and whenever the UK Purchaser defaults for any reason whatsoever in
         the performance of any obligation, commitment or undertaking undertaken
         or expressed to be undertaken under or pursuant to this agreement or
         the Tax Indemnity, the US Purchaser shall upon demand within ten
         Business Days unconditionally perform (or procure performance of) and
         satisfy (or procure satisfaction of) the obligation, commitment or
         undertaking in regard to which such default has been made in the manner
         prescribed by this Agreement or the Tax Indemnity and so that the same
         benefits shall be conferred on the Seller as would have been received
         if such obligation, commitment or undertaking had been duly performed
         and satisfied by the UK Purchaser. The US Purchaser waives any right
         which it may have to require the Seller to proceed first against or
         claim payment from the UK Purchaser to the intent that as between the
         Seller and the US Purchaser the latter shall be liable as principal
         debtor as if it had entered into all undertakings, agreements and other
         obligations jointly and severally with the UK Purchaser.

14.3     This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and accordingly is to
         remain in force until all the obligations of the UK Purchaser referred
         to in this Agreement or the Tax Indemnity shall have been performed or
         satisfied, and shall not be satisfied, discharged or affected by any
         intermediate payment or settlement of account, regardless of the
         legality, validity or enforceability of any provisions of this
         Agreement or the Tax Indemnity and notwithstanding the entry into any
         voluntary or involuntary insolvency procedure, dissolution or other
         analogous


                                      -34-

         proceeding relating to, or other incapacity of, the UK Purchaser or any
         change in the status, control, constitution or ownership of the UK
         Purchaser or by any other matter or thing whatsoever. The guarantee is
         in addition to and without prejudice to or limiting nor in substitution
         for any rights or security which the Seller may now or hereafter have
         or hold for the performance and observance of the obligations,
         commitments and undertakings of the UK Purchaser under or in connection
         with this Agreement and the Tax Indemnity.

14.4     As a separate and independent stipulation, the US Purchaser agrees that
         any obligation, commitment or undertaking expressed to be undertaken by
         the UK Purchaser under this Agreement or the Tax Indemnity (including,
         without limitation, any monies expressed to be payable under this
         Agreement or the Tax Indemnity) which may not be enforceable against or
         recoverable from the UK Purchaser by reason of any legal limitation,
         disability or incapacity on or of the UK Purchaser or any fact or
         circumstance (other than any limitation imposed by this Agreement or
         the Tax Indemnity or by law) shall nevertheless be enforceable against
         and recoverable from the US Purchaser as though the same had been
         incurred by the US Purchaser and the US Purchaser were the sole and
         principal obligor in respect thereof and shall be performed or paid by
         the US Purchaser on demand.

15       Other Provisions

15.1     Further Assurances

         15.1.1  Each of the parties shall from time to time execute such

                 Shares to the US Purchaser and the UK Shares to the UK
                 Purchaser and to give any party the full benefit of this

                 pursuant to Schedule 5 or in the possession of the Group
                 Companies as at Closing. Upon reasonable notice being given by
                 the Seller to the relevant Purchaser, the relevant Purchaser
                 shall make available such books, records and other information

         15.2.3  Without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 8.4 and so far as
                 is permitted by law and except in the case of fraud, each of

                 undertaking made or given in connection with this Agreement
                 shall be for breach of the terms of this Agreement to the
                 exclusion of all other rights and remedies (including those in

         Each of the parties confirms it has received independent legal advice
         relating to all the matters provided for in this Agreement including
         the terms of Clause 15.2 (Whole Agreement) and agrees that the
         provisions of this Agreement (including the Disclosure Letter, the

15.4     No Assignment

                 Agreement provided however that such assignment shall not be
                 absolute but shall be expressed to have effect only for so long
                 as the assignee remains a subsidiary of the party concerned.

15.5     Third Party Rights

         A person, other than a Group Company (whilst such Group Company remains
         in the US Purchasers' Group), who is not a party to this Agreement has

         otherwise to enforce any term of, or enjoy any benefit under, this
         Agreement.

15.8     Method of Payment

         15.8.1  Wherever in this Agreement provision is made for a payment by
                 one party to another, any such payments shall be effected by
                 crediting for same day value the account specified in writing
                 by the payee to the payer (reasonably in advance and in
                 sufficient detail to enable payment by telegraphic or other
                 electronic means to be effected) on or before the due date for
                 payment.

         15.8.2  Payment of a sum in accordance with this Clause shall be a good
                 discharge to the payer (and those on whose behalf such payment
                 is made) of its obligation to make such payment and the payer
                 (and those on whose behalf such payment is made) shall not be

         15.9.2  The Purchasers shall bear all costs incurred by them in

                 this Agreement, the Tax Indemnity and the sale of the Shares.

15.10    Interest

         If any party defaults in the payment when due of any sum payable under
         this Agreement or the Tax Indemnity (howsoever determined) the
         liability of that party shall be increased to include interest on such
         sum from the date when such payment is due until the date of actual
         payment (as well after as before judgment) at a rate per annum of 4 per
         cent above the base rate from time to time of the Royal Bank of
         Scotland plc. Such interest shall accrue from day to day and shall be
         compounded with monthly rests.

                 to any VAT thereon not otherwise recoverable by the other
                 party, subject to that party using all reasonable endeavours to
                 recover such amount of VAT as may be practicable.

         15.11.2 If any payment under this Agreement constitutes the
                 consideration for a taxable supply for VAT purposes, then in
                 addition to that payment the payer shall pay any VAT due.

                 and construed in accordance with English law.

                 courts and waives any objection to proceedings in any such
                 court on the ground of venue or on the ground that proceedings

15.16    Appointment of Process Agent

         15.16.1 The US Purchaser hereby irrevocably appoints the Company

         15.16.2 If such process agent ceases to be able to act as such or to
                 have an address in England, the US Purchaser irrevocably agrees
                 to appoint a new process agent in England acceptable to the
                 Seller and to deliver to the Seller within 14 days a copy of a
                 written acceptance of appointment by the process agent.

2        Accounting Policies

2.2      The Net Asset Statement shall be drawn up as at close of business in
         the relevant locations at the date on which Closing takes place. No
         account shall be taken of events taking place after the close of

         to information available to the parties to this Agreement at that time.

2.3      The Net Asset Statement shall be expressed in pounds sterling.

2.4      For the purposes of accounting for slow moving stock provisions, the
         following policies shall apply:

         Stock               parameter basis (other than PC Compatibles and PC

                             vial-packaged form in excess of 12 months'

                             blister-packaged stocks have an expiry date within
                             12 months' of Closing and in the case of vial-

3        Preparation

3.1      No later than 60 days following Closing the Purchasers shall deliver to
         the Seller the Draft Net Asset Statement. Prior to such delivery, the
         Purchasers shall so far as is practicable consult with the Seller with
         a view to reducing the potential areas of disagreement.

3.2      In order to enable the Purchasers to prepare and agree the Draft Net
         Asset Statement, the Seller shall keep up-to-date and, subject to
         reasonable notice, make available to the Purchasers' representatives
         and to the Purchasers' accountants all books and records relating to
         the Group during normal office hours and co-operate with them with
         regard to the preparation and agreement of the Draft Net Asset
         Statement.

3.3      The Purchasers agree insofar as it is reasonable to do so, to make
         available the services of the employees of the Group to assist the
         Seller in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. If the
         Seller does not within 30 days of presentation to it of the Draft Net
         Asset Statement give notice to the Purchasers that it disagrees with
         the Draft Net Asset Statement or any item thereof, such notice stating
         the reasons for the disagreement in reasonable detail and specifying
         the adjustments which, in the Sellers opinion should be made to the
         Draft Net Asset Statement (the "Sellers Disagreement Notice"), the
         Draft Net Asset Statement shall be final and binding on the parties for
         all purposes. If the Seller gives a valid Sellers Disagreement Notice
         within such 30 days, the Seller shall keep up to date and, subject to
         reasonable notice, make available to the Purchasers representatives and
         the Purchasers' accountants all books and records relating to the
         relevant part of the Group during normal office hours during the period
         from the date of the Seller's Disagreement Notice until the date on
         which such disagreement is resolved. The Seller and the Purchasers
         shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement in respect of the Draft
         Net Asset Statement and, if they are unable to do so within 21 days of
         such notification, the Seller or either of the Purchasers may by notice
         to the other (an "Appointment Notice") require that the Draft Net Asset
         Statement be referred to. An independent accountant which in the
         absence of agreement between the parties shall be appointed by the
         President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants (the "Reporting
         Accountants").

3.4      Within 21 days of the giving of an Appointment Notice, the Purchasers
         may by notice to the Seller indicate that, in the light of the fact
         that the Seller has not accepted the Draft Net Asset Statement in its
         entirety, it wishes the Reporting Accountants to consider matters
         relating to the Draft Net Asset Statement in addition to those
         specified in the Seller's Disagreement Notice, such notice stating in
         reasonable detail the reasons why and in what respects the Purchaser
         believes that the Draft Net Asset Statement should be altered (the
         "Purchaser's Disagreement Notice").

3.5      The Reporting Accountants shall be engaged jointly by the Seller and
         the Purchasers on the terms set out in this paragraph 3 and otherwise
         on such terms as shall be agreed; provided that neither the Seller not
         the Purchasers shall unreasonably (having regard, inter alia, to the
         provisions of this paragraph 3) refuse its agreement to terms proposed
         by the Reporting Accountants or by the other party. If the terms of
         engagement of the Reporting Accountants have not been settled within 45
         days of their identity having been determined (or such longer period as
         the Seller and the Purchasers may agree) then, unless the Seller or the
         Purchasers are unreasonably refusing its agreement to those terms,
         those accountants shall be deemed never to have become the Reporting
         Accountants and new Reporting Accountants shall be selected in
         accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3.3 above.

3.6      Except to the extent that the Seller and the Purchasers agree
         otherwise, the Reporting Accountants shall determine their own
         procedure but:

         3.6.1    apart from procedural matters and as otherwise set out in this
                  Agreement shall determine only:

                  (i)      whether any of the arguments for an alteration to the
                           Draft Net Asset Statement put forward in the
                           Purchasers' Disagreement Notice or the Seller's
                           Disagreement Notice is correct in whole or in part;
                           and

                  (ii)     if so, what alterations should be made to the Draft
                           Net Asset Statement in order to correct the relevant
                           inaccuracy in it;

         3.6.2    shall apply the principles set out in paragraph 2 of Schedule
                  6;

         3.6.3    shall make their determination pursuant to paragraph 3.6.1
                  above as soon as is reasonably practicable;

         3.6.4    the procedure of the Reporting Accountants shall:

                  (i)      give the Seller and Purchasers a reasonable
                           opportunity to make written and oral representations
                           to them;

                  (ii)     require that each party supply the other with a copy
                           of any written representations at the same time as
                           they are made to the Reporting Accountants;

                  (iii)    permit each party to be present while oral
                           submissions are being made by the other party; and

         3.6.5    for the avoidance of doubt, the Reporting Accountants shall
                  not be entitled to determine the scope of their own
                  jurisdiction.

3.7      The determination of the Reporting Accountants pursuant to paragraph
         3.6.1 shall:

         3.7.1    be made in writing;

         3.7.2    be made available to the Seller and the Purchasers at the same
                  time; and

         3.7.3    unless otherwise agreed by the Seller and the Purchasers
                  include reasons for each relevant determination.

3.8      The Reporting Accountants shall act as experts and not as arbitrators
         and their determination of any matter falling within their jurisdiction
         shall be final and binding on the Seller and the Purchasers save in the
         event of manifest error (when the relevant part of their determination
         shall be void and the matter shall be remitted to the Reporting
         Accountants for correction). In particular, without limitation their
         determination shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Draft Net
         Asset Statement.

3.9      The expenses (including VAT) of the Reporting Accountants shall be
         borne as they shall direct at the time they make any determination
         under paragraph 3.6.1 or, failing such direction, in two equal
         proportions between the Purchasers (acting together), on the one hand,
         and the Seller, on the other.

3.10     The Seller and the Purchasers (acting together) shall co-operate with
         the Reporting Accountants and comply with their reasonable requests
         made in connection with the carrying out of their duties under this
         Agreement. In particular, without limitation, each party shall keep
         up-to-date and, subject to reasonable notice and the request itself
         being unreasonable, make available to the other parties
         representatives, the other parties accountants and the Reporting
         Accountants all books and records relating to the Group during normal
         office hours during the period from the appointment of the Reporting
         Accountants down to the making of the relevant determination.

3.11     Nothing in this paragraph 3 shall entitle a party or the Reporting
         Accountants access to any information or document which is protected by
         legal professional privilege, or which has been prepared by the other
         party or its accountants and other professional advisers with a view to
         assessing the merits of any claim or argument.

3.12     Each party and the Reporting Accountants shall, and shall procure that
         its accountants and other advisers shall, keep all information and
         documents provided to them pursuant to this paragraph 3 confidential
         and shall not use the same for any purpose, except for disclosure or
         use in connection with the preparation of the Draft Net Asset
         Statement, the proceedings of the Reporting Accountants or another
         matter arising out of this Agreement or in defending any claim or
         argument or alleged claim or argument relating to this Agreement or its
         subject matter.

3.13     The provisions of this paragraph 3 (and in particular paragraph 3.8)
         are without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 11.5 which provides
         for a further adjustment between the Seller and the Purchasers in
         relation to slow moving stock.

                  (including the acquisition of the Shares by the Purchasers)
                  will:

                  (i)      cause any Group Company to lose the benefit of any
                           right or privilege it presently enjoys or cause any
                           person who normally does business with any relevant

         There are no powers of attorney given by any Group Company other than
         to the holder of an Encumbrance (which has been Disclosed) solely to
         facilitate its enforcement nor any other authority (express, implied or
         ostensible) given by any Group Company to any person to enter into any

                           benefits for current or past directors or employees
                           of Hydron. No proposal has been announced to

                           except under the UK Pension Schemes.

                  (ii)     So far as the Seller is aware, no discretion has been
                           exercised to admit an employee of Hydron to

                           otherwise be eligible and no discretion has been
                           exercised to provide a benefit to any employee of
                           Hydron other than under the UK Pension Schemes.

                           been withdrawn or refused and the Board of Inland
                           Revenue have not given notice to the applicant that
                           they believe the application has been dropped.
                           Members of the Hydron Pension Scheme are
                           contracted-out of the State Earnings Related Pension
                           Scheme. Members of the Biocompatibles Retirement Plan

                           Pension Scheme.

                                   Schedule 12
                          Promissory Notes and Security


1        There is one vendor of shares, Biocompatibles International plc
         ("PLC").

2        The shares being sold are shares in Biocompatibles Eyecare, Inc.
         ("BEI") (a US company), shares in Biocompatibles Canada Inc. ("BE
         Canada") (a Canadian Company) and shares in Hydron Limited ("Hydron")(
         a UK company).

3        There are two purchasers of the shares - a US purchaser, The Cooper
         Companies, Inn. ("TCC") which buys BEI, and Aspect Vision Holdings
         Limited ("AVH"), a UK subsidiary of TCC which buys Hydron.

4        The SPA provides that part of the consideration will be paid by TCC/AVH
         on closing and part will be deferred.

5        The consideration is adjustable to reflect intra-group borrowings,
         external finance and a net asset adjustment.

6        Under the share sale and purchase agreement ("SPA"), TCC guarantees the
         obligations of AVH.

7        The promissory notes and security for the deferred consideration will
         be issued/created on closing of the SPA on 28 February 2002.

8        Interest at the rate of 5% per annum will be paid monthly in advance,
         ie. on 28 February, 28 March, 28 April, etc.

9        It is intended that the deferred consideration under the SPA will be
         paid by TCC and AVH on 15 May, provided that audited figures relating
         to the companies being acquired (including subsidiaries) are made
         available by PLC to TCC on or before 15 February 2002, so as to enable
         TCC to provide the relevant information to its bankers. If and to the
         extent that PLC is not able to provide such audited figures on such
         date, an extra day is added on to the 15 May date for redemption.

10       The security being offered by TCC and AVH are the shares in BEI and
         Hydron, which will be acquired on closing of the SPA. Additional
         security will also be provided by BEI granting a charge over its
         facility in Norfolk, Virginia, USA.

11       It has also been agreed that AVH will not dispose of Hydron, nor Hydron
         Investments Limited, nor transfer assets out of those two companies
         whilst the deferred consideration is outstanding. TCC and AVH will want
         to transfer assets out of the underlying subsidiaries of Hydron
         Investments, as part of the post-closing integration programme which
         TCC intends to carry out.

12       Whilst the intention is that TCC/AVH will repay on 15 May (or such
         later date as is relevant following the failure of PLC to produce the
         relevant audited figures) the actual repayment date is 15 November
         2002. Accordingly, non-payment on 15 May is not an event of default.

13       Events of default after 28 February through to 15 November should be
         standard.

14       Linked to the issue of the notes and the grant of security are
         arrangement and administration fees, which are payable by TCC (not AVH)
         to PLC. Assuming that the outstanding amount payable under the notes is
         not paid on 15 May (or such later date, etc) then fees will be payable
         to PLC on the basis that for the first three months after 15 May a fee
         at the rate of 'L'367k will be payable in advance to PLC and for each
         of the three months


                                     -112-

         after the first period of three months a fee at the rate of 'L'733k
         per month will be payable in advance to PLC. The obligation to pay fees
         terminates as soon as the deferred consideration is paid.

15       Neither TCC nor any of its subsidiary companies shall be entitled to
         exercise, and shall legally waive, any right of set off against amounts
         of principal and interest payable on the Promissory Notes, whether
         arising under this Agreement, the Deed of Tax Indemnity or otherwise.
