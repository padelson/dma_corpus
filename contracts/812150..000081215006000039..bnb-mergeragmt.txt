- Form of Guarantee      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    THIS
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of August 31,
2006, by and between Babcock and Brown Bravo Holdings LLC ("Buyer"), a Delaware
limited liability company, Babcock and Brown Bravo Acquisition Corp. ("Buyer
Acquisition Entity"), a Maryland corporation, Babcock and Brown Bravo Operating
Partnership LP ("Buyer Operating Partnership"), a Delaware
limited partnership, BNP Residential Properties, Inc. ("Target"), a
Maryland corporation, and BNP Residential Properties Limited Partnership
("Target Operating Partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership.   
Preamble    WHEREAS, it is proposed that Target shall merge (the "Merger")
with and into Buyer Acquisition Entity with Buyer Acquisition Entity
surviving in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the
"MGCL"), pursuant to which each of the issued and outstanding common shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Target, together with the
associated preferred stock purchase rights granted pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, dated as of March 18, 1999 (as amended, the "Rights Agreement"),
between Target and First Union National Bank as Rights Agent (together, the
"Target Common Stock"), shall be converted into the right to receive the
Common Stock Price Per Share (as defined herein) upon the terms and subject
to the conditions provided herein;    WHEREAS, it is proposed that Buyer
Operating Partnership shall merge with and into Target Operating Partnership
(the "OP Merger" and collectively with the Merger, the "Mergers"), with
Target Operating Partnership surviving in accordance with the Delaware
Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as amended ("DRULPA"), pursuant to
which each unit of partnership interest in Target Operating Partnership,
together with the associated preferred unit purchase rights granted pursuant
to Article 16 of the Target OP Agreement (as defined herein) (together, a
"Target OP Unit") that is not owned by Target shall be converted into the
right to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration;    WHEREAS, the
Board of Directors of the Target adopted a resolution declaring that the
Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Target and directing
that the Merger be submitted for consideration at a meeting of
the stockholders of Target;    WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the
Target, on behalf of Target as the general partner of Target Operating
Partnership, has determined that the OP Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best
interest of Target Operating Partnership and voted to approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby;    WHEREAS, as an inducement to
the Buyer entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set
forth herein, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, certain officers and directors of Target and certain limited
partners of Target Operating Partnership are each entering into a Voting
Agreement (a "Voting Agreement")    relating to shares of Target Common
Stock and Target OP Units (Common), as applicable, held by such officers and
directors and limited partners; and    WHEREAS, the Parties hereto intend
that for federal income tax purposes and, where applicable, state income tax
purposes, the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by Target of all of
Target\'s assets to Buyer Acquisition Entity in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Target Common Stock and the
assumption of all of Target\'s liabilities, followed by a distribution of
such Merger Consideration to the holders of Target Common Stock in
liquidation of Target pursuant to Section 331 of the Code and Section 562
of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation"
of Target for federal income tax purposes;    WHEREAS, concurrently with
the execution of the this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Target a
guarantee of the obligations arising under this Agreement of Buyer, Buyer
Acquisition Entity and Buyer Operating Partnership executed by Babcock and
Brown International Pty Ltd, in the form attached as Exhibit A to this
Agreement (the "Guarantee").    WHEREAS, the Parties hereto desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Merger.    Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in Section 10.1 of this Agreement.    NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the above and the mutual warranties, representations,
covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I   THE MERGER  1.1 The Mergers   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Merger Effective Time, Target shall be
merged with and into Buyer Acquisition Entity in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3-102 of the MGCL and with the effect provided in
Section 3-114 of the MGCL, and the separate existence of Target shall cease.
Buyer Acquisition Entity shall be the surviving corporation resulting from
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by
the Laws of the State of Maryland.   (b) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, Buyer
Operating Partnership shall be merged with and into Target Operating
Partnership in accordance with the DRULPA, and the separate existence of

be the surviving partnership resulting from the OP Merger (the "Surviving
Partnership") and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of
Delaware.   2   1.2 Time and Place of Closing   The closing of the
Mergers (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on a
date to be specified by the Parties, which date will be no later than five
(5) Business Days following the satisfaction (or waiver, to the extent
permitted by Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, other than
such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment (or waiver, to the extent permitted by Law)
of those conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, or at such other time as
the Parties, acting through their authorized officers, may mutually agree
in writing; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be obligated to effect
the Merger and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to June
30, 2007 if Target shall not have received any of the Consents set forth on
Section 4.2(c)(ii) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum on terms satisfactory
to Buyer, in its sole and absolute discretion, or if any Consent received
prior to such date shall no longer be in full force and effect. The Closing
shall be held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Closing Date."  1.3 Effective Times   (a) On the Closing Date, Target and
Buyer Acquisition Entity shall execute and file articles of merger, in such
form as is required by the relevant provisions of the MGCL (the "Articles of
Merger") in accordance with, and shall make all other filings or recordings
and take all such other action required with respect to the Merger under, the
MGCL. Unless Target and Buyer agree otherwise, the Merger shall become
effective when the Articles of Merger have been accepted for record by the
State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland or at such other
time specified in the Articles of Merger (the "Merger Effective Time"), it
being understood that the parties shall cause the Merger Effective Time to
occur as soon as practicable after the Closing.   (b) On the Closing Date,
prior to the Merger Effective Time, Target Operating Partnership and Buyer
Operating Partnership shall execute and file the certificate of merger with
respect to the OP Merger, in such form as required by the relevant provisions
of the DRULPA (the "LP Certificate of Merger"), and shall make all other
filings or recordings and take all such other action required with respect to
the OP Merger under the DRULPA. Unless Target and Buyer otherwise agree, the
OP Merger shall become effective when the LP Certificate of Merger has been
accepted for record with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such other
time specified in the LP Certificate of Merger (the "Partnership Merger
Effective Time"), it being understood that the parties shall cause
the Partnership Merger Effective Time to occur prior to the Merger Effective
Time.  1.4 Organizational Documents   (a) The Charter of Buyer Acquisition
Entity in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be
charter of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended or repealed. The
Bylaws of Buyer Acquisition Entity in effect immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until duly
amended or repealed.   3    (b) The agreement of limited partnership of
Target Operating Partnership shall continue to be the agreement of limited
partnership of the Surviving Partnership following the Partnership Merger
Effective Time until further amended in accordance with the DRULPA. The
certificate of limited partnership of Target Operating Partnership shall
continue to be the certificate of limited partnership of the Surviving
Partnership following the Partnership Merger Effective Time until further
amended in accordance with the DRULPA.  1.5 Directors and Officers   (a)
The directors of Buyer Acquisition Entity immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and
after the Merger Effective Time until their successors have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) The officers of Buyer Acquisition Entity immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time shall serve as the officers of the
Surviving Corporation from and after the Merger Effective Time until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE II   MANNER OF CONVERTING
SHARES  2.1 Conversion of Shares   Subject to the provisions of this
Article II, at the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Buyer Acquisition Entity or Target or the
stockholders of any of the foregoing:   (a) Each share of common stock of
Buyer Acquisition Entity issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time shall continue to be one issued and outstanding share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Each share of Target
Common Stock (other than any Cancelled Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(c)))
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive a cash payment in the
amount of $24.00 without interest and less any applicable amounts required to
be withheld in accordance with Section 3.4 with respect to such payment (such
sum, the "Common Stock Price Per Share"), payable upon surrender of the
certificate of Target Common Stock formerly representing such share. All such
shares of Target Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Common Stock Price Per Share to be paid in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with this Section
2.1(b), without interest.   4    (c) Each share of Target Common Stock
issued and outstanding and owned, directly or indirectly, by Buyer or Buyer
Acquisition Entity immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time or held by
the Target (collectively, the "Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled
automatically and shall cease to exist, without payment of any consideration
being made in respect thereof.   (d) If, at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective Time, any change
in the outstanding Target Common Stock shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (it
being understood that the right of Target to effect the foregoing shall be
subject to Section 6.2), the Common Stock Price Per Share shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.  2.2 Partnership Merger Consideration  
(a) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the OP Merger and
without any further action on the part of the Parties, each OP Unit issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time
that is owned by Target (the "Cancelled OP Units") shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.   (b) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
by virtue of the OP Merger and without any further action on the part of the
Parties, each OP Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, other than OP Units cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.2(a), shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the Common Stock Price Per Share. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Buyer delivers a notice (an "Election Notice") to Target
that it intends to offer holders of Target OP Units an opportunity to elect
to (i) retain common units ("Continuing Units") in the Surviving Partnership
with terms that are substantially the same as the Target OP Units, or (ii)
receive a new class of preferred units ("Preferred Units") in the Surviving
Partnership with terms specified by Buyer, then if any holder of Target OP
Units qualifies as an "accredited investor" (within the meaning of Section
501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) and has previously
submitted to Buyer a Form of Election in accordance with the procedures and
time periods specified in Section 7.17 hereof (the "Election"), then, in lieu
of the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Common Stock Price Per
Share, such holder\'s Target OP Units shall be converted into Continuing
Units or Preferred Units, as specified by such holder in its Form of
Election. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date that Target
determines in good faith is the date that it intends to mail the Proxy
Statement, Target shall deliver a written notice to Buyer specifying such
intended mailing date. Buyer shall deliver the Election Notice at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the date specified by Target as its intended date
for mailing the Proxy Statement.   (c) At the Partnership Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the OP Merger and without any further action on the part
of the Parties, (i) the general partner interest in Buyer Operating
Partnership shall be automatically converted into the general partner
interest in the Surviving Partnership and shall constitute the only
outstanding general partner interest in the   5   Surviving Partnership
and (ii) the limited partner interest in Buyer Operating Partnership shall
automatically be converted into a limited partner interest in the Surviving
Partnership and shall constitute the only outstanding limited partner
interest in the Surviving Partnership unless any holders of Target OP Units
make an Election to receive Continuing Units or Preferred Units.  (d) If, at
any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, any change in the outstanding OP Units
shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, unit
split (including a reverse unit split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of units, or any unit dividend or unit distribution with a
record date during such period (it being understood that the right of Target
to effect the foregoing shall be subject to section 6.2), the Partnership
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change.  2.3 No Appraisal Rights   The holders of Target Common Stock and
Target OP Units shall not be entitled to appraisal or similar rights as a
result of the Merger.  2.4 Conversion of Stock Options   (a) Prior to the
Merger Effective Time, Target shall take such actions as may be necessary so
that each stock option, stock purchase right, any other similar right to
acquire shares of Target Common Stock, or any other right to receive payment
with respect to an award (the "Existing Target Options") issued under the BNP
Residential Properties, Inc. Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan (the "Stock Option Plan"), or under any agreement to which
Target or any Target Subsidiary is a party, is fully vested (to the
extent not otherwise vested) at the Merger Effective Time. At the Merger
Effective Time, (i) each holder of an Existing Target Option shall be
entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes, equal to the amount, if any, by which the Common Stock
Price Per Share exceeds the per share exercise or purchase price of such
Existing Target Option multiplied by the number of shares of Target Common
Stock subject to such Existing Target Option, and (ii) each Existing Target
Option shall be canceled at the Merger Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the exercise price per share provided for in any Existing
Target Option equals or exceeds the Common Stock Price Per Share, no cash
shall be paid with regard to such Existing Target Option to the holder of
such Existing Target Option. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Buyer and
Target shall establish a procedure to effect the surrender of Existing Target
Options contemplated by this Section 2.4(a).   (b) In connection with the
Merger, as of the Merger Effective Time, any restrictions with respect to
outstanding restricted shares awarded under the Stock Option Plan shall
terminate or lapse. After such restrictions terminate or lapse, the shares
relating thereto shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
the Common Stock Price per Share on the terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable sections of this Article II.   (c) As of the Merger Effective
Time, (i) the Stock Option Plan shall terminate, (ii) all awards issued under
such Stock Option Plan shall be terminated and (iii) no holder of an Existing
Target Option or any participant in such Stock Option Plan shall have any
right thereunder to   6   acquire any securities of Target, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof or receive any payment or benefit with
respect to any award previously granted under the Stock Option Plan except as
provided in Section 2.4(a).  2.5 Termination of Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan   Target shall terminate its Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan (the "DRIP"), effective prior to the Merger Effective
Time, and ensure that no purchase or other rights under the DRIP enable the
holder of any such rights to acquire any interest in the Surviving
Corporation, Buyer or Buyer Acquisition Entity as a result of such purchase
or exercise of such rights at or after the Merger Effective Time. Target has
taken all necessary and appropriate action to ensure that no additional
shares of Target Common Stock shall be issued under the DRIP following
execution of this Agreement.   ARTICLE III   EXCHANGE PROCEDURES  3.1
Paying Agent   Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Buyer shall
designate a bank or trust company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for
the payment of the Common Stock Price Per Share upon surrender of
certificates formerly representing issued and outstanding shares of Target
Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares) and surrender of Target OP Units
(other than Cancelled OP Units) and payment in respect of Existing Target
Options upon surrender and cancellation of Existing Target Options, in each
case without interest thereon (the "Exchange Fund"). Promptly following the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to
the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make the cash payments
referred to in this Section 3.1.  3.2 Exchange Procedures with respect to
Target Common Stock   (a) As promptly as practicable after the Merger
Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days), Buyer
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (each, a "Certificate") that immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Target Common
Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Common Stock
Price Per Share pursuant to section 2.1(b) (the "Merger Consideration"): (i)
a letter of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonable specify; and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.   (b) Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and any
other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Surviving
Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a check in the amount equal to the Merger Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.1(b); and (ii) the Certificate   7   so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2,
each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Merger Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration.   (c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Target
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Target, the
Merger Consideration shall be paid to a transferee if (i) the Certificate
representing such Target Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent
properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required
by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and (ii) such
transferee shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  3.3 Exchange
Procedures with respect to Target OP Units   (a) As promptly as practicable
after the Partnership Merger Effective Time (but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days), Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of Target OP Units registered on the transfer books of Target Operating
Partnership immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (i) a
letter of transmittal (a "Unitholder Letter of Transmittal") which shall
certify to the Buyer and to the Paying Agent the number of Target OP Units
held by such holder and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify; and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the delivery of the Unitholder Letter of Transmittal in
order to receive the consideration specified in Section 2.2(b) (the
"Partnership Merger Consideration").   (b) Upon delivery of a Unitholder
Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and any other documents reasonably
required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the holder of the
Target OP Units identified in such Unitholder Letter of Transmittal shall be
entitled to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(b).   (c) In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Target OP Units which is not
registered in the transfer records of Target Operating Partnership,
the Partnership Merger Consideration shall be paid to a transferee if (i)
such transferee delivers a Unitholder Letter of Transmittal in accordance
with Section 3.3(a) and (ii) such transferee shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the Target OP Unit or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying
Agent and the Surviving Partnership that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.  3.4 Withholding Rights   Target, Target Operating
Partnership, Buyer, Surviving Corporation, Surviving Partnership or Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Article II to any former holder
of shares of Target Common Stock or Target OP Units, such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so    8   withheld
by Target, Target Operating Partnership, Buyer, Surviving
Corporation, Surviving Partnership or Paying Agent, as applicable, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Target Common Stock or
Target OP Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.  3.5 Rights of Former Target Stockholders   (a) The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Target Common Stock and, after
the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Target Common Stock. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.   (b) The
Partnership Merger Consideration paid with respect to the Target OP Units in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Target OP Units and, after the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Partnership of the Target OP
Units.  3.6 Termination of Exchange Fund   Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto)
that remains undistributed to the former holders of Target Common Stock or
Target OP Units on the first anniversary of the Merger Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Buyer upon demand, and any former holders of Target
Common Stock or Target OP Units who have not theretofore received any
applicable Merger Consideration or Partnership Merger Consideration, as
applicable, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Partnership, as applicable, for payment of their claims with
respect thereto.  3.7 No Liability   Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither Buyer, Buyer Acquisition Entity nor Buyer Operating
Partnership shall be liable to any former holder of Target Common Stock or
Target OP Units for any amount properly paid or property properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such
securities immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any governmental authority,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Partnership, as applicable, free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their
successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.   9   3.8 Additional Actions   If, at any time after the
Merger Effective Time, Buyer shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other documents, actions or

states of the United States and foreign jurisdictions where the ownership of
its property, character of its Assets or the nature or conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except for such
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed has not had
and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Target Material Adverse Effect. Target has made available to Buyer, prior
to the date of this Agreement, a true and complete copy of Target\'s Charter
and Bylaws, and Target Operating Partnership has made available to Buyer,

one of its Subsidiaries owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of
stock (or other Equity Rights) of each Target Subsidiary. Except as disclosed
in Section 4.4(a) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, no stock (or other
Equity Rights) of any Target Subsidiary is or may become required to be
issued (other than to Target or another wholly owned Target Subsidiary) by
reason of any Equity Rights, and there are no Contracts by which any Target
Subsidiary is bound to issue (other than to Target or another Target
Subsidiary) additional shares of its stock (or other equity interests) or
Equity Rights or by which Target or any Target Subsidiary is or may be bound
to transfer any shares of the stock (or other equity interests) of any Target

disclosed in Section 4.4(a) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, there are no
Contracts relating to the rights of Target or any Target Subsidiary to vote
or to dispose of any shares of the stock (or other equity interests) of any
Target Subsidiary. Except as noted in Section 4.4(a) of the Target Disclosure
Memorandum, all of the shares of stock (or other equity interests) of each
Target Subsidiary held by Target or a Target Subsidiary have been issued in
compliance with applicable Law and not in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and owned by Target or a Target Subsidiary free and clear of
any material Lien. Except as disclosed in Section 4.4(a) of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum, each Target Subsidiary is a corporation, limited
liability company, limited partnership or limited liability partnership, and
each such Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing, and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated
or organized, and has the power (corporate or otherwise) and authority
necessary for it to own, lease, and operate its Assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted, except where such failure is not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse Effect.
Each Target Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as
a foreign entity in good standing in the States of the United States and
foreign jurisdictions where the ownership of its property, the character of
its Assets or the nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified or licensed, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to
be so qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse Effect. Target has made available
to Buyer, prior to the date of this Agreement, true and complete copies of
the organizational documents of each Target Subsidiary. Such organizational
documents are in full force and effect. No Target subsidiary is in violation
of any provision of its applicable organizational documents.   (b) Except
for interests in Target Subsidiaries and except as set forth in Section

Target Subsidiaries owns directly or indirectly any interest or
investment that constitutes 1% or more of the voting securities or equity

venture, business, trust or entity (other than investments in short-term
securities). With respect to such interest or investment, Section 4.4(b) of

subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the "Target SEC Reports"), which
are all of the documents that Target was required to file with or furnish to
the SEC since January 1, 2003 and through the date hereof pursuant to the
federal securities Laws. The Target SEC Reports filed prior to or on the date
of this Agreement (i) at the time filed or furnished, complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the federal
securities Laws and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed or furnished,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material

to make the statements in such Target SEC Reports, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent such statements have been modified or superseded by later Target SEC
Reports filed and publicly available before the date of this Agreement. There
is no unresolved violation asserted by any Regulatory Authority with respect
to any Target SEC Reports, and Target does not have any outstanding and
unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Target SEC
Documents. No Target Subsidiary is subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file any SEC

with the applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (iii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent

statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), (iv) fairly presented in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Target and its
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates and the consolidated results of

Target\'s chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and, at the time of filing or submission of each
such certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  4.6 Absence of Undisclosed
Liabilities   Neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary has any Liabilities,
whether or not required to be reflected in or reserved against in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP,   16   whether due or to
become due, except (i) Liabilities which are accrued or reserved against in
the consolidated balance sheets of Target as of June 30, 2006, including in
the Target Financial Statements delivered prior to the date of this Agreement
or reflected in the notes thereto, (ii) those Liabilities disclosed in
Section 4.6 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, (iii) Liabilities disclosed
in the Target Disclosure Memorandum in response to any other representation
of Target in Article IV of this Agreement, (iv) Liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices subsequent to June

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse

except as disclosed in Section 4.7 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum,
Target and each of the Target Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice and  
(a) there have been no events, changes, occurrences, effects,
facts, violations, developments or circumstances which have had, or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a (i) Target
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) with respect to events, changes,
occurrences, effects, facts, violations, developments or circumstances
relating to the matters that are the subject of Section 4.9 or 4.10 (other
than matters related to toxic mold), a Specified Target Material Adverse
Effect; provided, that, with respect to this clause (ii), the events,
changes, occurrences, effects, facts, violations, developments or
circumstances resulting from or relating to the items described in clauses
(A) - (G) of the definition of Target Material Adverse Effect shall be
ignored;   (b) Target and its Subsidiaries have not taken any action that,
if taken during the period between the date of this Agreement through the
Merger Effective Time, would constitute a violation of Section 6.2; and  
(c) there has not been any change that would prevent or delay beyond the
Termination Date (as defined in Section 9.1(f)) the ability of Target or
the Target Operating Partnership to consummate the Mergers or any of the
other transactions contemplated in this Agreement.  4.8 Tax Matters  
Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum:  
(a) Target and each Target Subsidiary have timely filed all income
Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by them
(after giving effect to any extension granted by a taxing authority having
authority to do so), and such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all
material respects. All Liabilities for Taxes of Target and each Target
Subsidiary, whether or not shown on such Tax Returns, have been fully paid.
There are no Liens for any Taxes on any of the Assets of Target or any Target
Subsidiary (other than a Lien for current real property or ad valorem Taxes
not yet due and payable). Neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary has
incurred any material Liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or
4981 of the Code, including any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction
described in Section   17   857(b)(6) of the Code. Neither Target nor any
Target Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to
"redetermined rents, redetermined deductions and excess interest" described
in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code. No event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax
described in the preceding sentences will be imposed on Target or any Target
Subsidiary or presents a material risk that Target\'s status as a REIT will
be jeopardized. Neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary has incurred any
Liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. With
respect to Target and each Target Subsidiary, no state of facts exists or has
existed which, if known to the IRS or any other Regulatory Authority, would
constitute grounds for the assessment of any material Tax Liability with
respect to periods that have not been audited by the IRS or such other
Regulatory Authority. Target has previously delivered or made available to
Buyer true, correct, and complete copies of Target\'s Federal income Tax
Returns for 2000 and subsequent years and of the Target
Operating Partnership\'s Tax Returns of income for 2000 and subsequent years.
Each of such Tax Returns is true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Target\'s Federal income Tax Return for 2005 has not been prepared
as of the date hereof (and copies thereof shall be provided to Buyer when
such Tax Returns are prepared).   (b) Neither Target nor any Target
Subsidiary has received any written notice of assessment or proposed
assessment in connection with any Taxes, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Target, threatened disputes, claims, audits or examinations
regarding any Taxes of Target or any Target Subsidiary. Neither Target nor
any Target Subsidiary has waived or extended any statute of limitations in
respect of any Taxes or agreed to a Tax assessment or deficiency. No power of
attorney with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force with respect to
Target or any Target Subsidiary. Neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary is
a party to any Litigation or pending Litigation or administrative proceeding
relating to Taxes (other than Litigation dealing with appeals of property tax
valuations).   (c) Target (i) has been subject to taxation as a real estate
investment trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code
since its formation and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT
for all taxable years of its existence, (ii) has operated since its formation
to the date of this representation, and intends to continue to operate, in
such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year that includes the
Closing Date, and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which
would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge to its status as a
REIT. No such challenge is pending or threatened in writing. Each Target
Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company
(i) has been treated since its formation and continues to be treated for
federal income tax purposes either as a partnership or as an entity that is
disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or as an
association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of its
formation or the acquisition by Target of a direct or indirect interest
therein, owned any assets (including securities) that have caused Target to
violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code or would cause Target to violate
Section 856(c)(4) of the Code on the last day of any calendar quarter ending
after the date of this Agreement. Each Target Subsidiary that is a
corporation has been since its formation a qualified REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(i) of the Code or, since January 1, 2001, a taxable REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code. No Target Subsidiary that is
a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code (i) operates
or manages, has operated or managed, or will operate or manage prior to the
Closing Date a "lodging facility" or "health care facility" within the
meaning of Sections 856(1)(4)(A) and 856(1)(4)(B) of the Code,  
18   respectively, or (ii) licenses, has licensed, or will license prior to
the Closing Date, rights to any brand name under which any such lodging
facility or health care facility is operated. Neither Target nor any Target
Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to rules
similar to Section 1374 of the Code.   (d) Target and each Target
Subsidiary have complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws,
rules and regulations relating to the withholding and reporting of Taxes and
the payment thereof to the applicable Regulatory Authorities, including Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee or independent contractor, and Taxes required to be
withheld and paid pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 and 3402 of the
Code or similar provisions under foreign Law.   (e) The most recent audited
financial statements contained in the Target SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes
payable by Target and the Target Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements, and Taxes
payable by Target and each Target Subsidiary on the Closing Date will not

thereby.   (g) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(g) of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum, neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary is the lessee
of any ground lease and, except for that certain Amended and Restated Master

building systems are not in working order in any material respect, and (iii)
is no material physical damage to any Target Property for which there is

any Target Subsidiary is a party as landlord) (such leases, together with all
amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals, extensions and guarantees
related thereto, the "Target Leases"). Except as would not be reasonably

Target Disclosure Memorandum, none of Target or any of Target Subsidiaries
has entered into any contract or agreement with any third party or any

any such acquisition agreement and (ii) no party to any such acquisition
agreement has cause to terminate such acquisition agreement, pursuant to the
terms thereof (other than any termination rights exercisable at the sole
option of any such party).  4.10 Environmental Matters   (a) Except as set

Effect, (ii) threatening to revoke any Permits or notifying Target that any
Permits will not be renewed and there are no actions, suits, inquiries or
proceedings pending to revoke or withdraw any such Permits, the revocation of
which is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

that is subject to COBRA has been administered in compliance with such
requirements and with any applicable state law regarding health care
continuation requirements.   (h) Except as disclosed in Section 4.13(h) of
the Target Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will (i) result in any

Target Subsidiary from Target or any Target Subsidiary under any Target
Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Target Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of

be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section
280G(b)(1)) or be nondeductible under Code Section 280G and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.   (i) Except as disclosed in Section
4.13(i) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Target nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has made any commitment, whether legally binding or not,
to establish any new Employee Benefit Plan or to modify any existing Target
Benefit Plan, except as otherwise required by Law.   (j) All amendments and
actions required to bring the Target Benefit Plans into conformity in all
material respects with all of the applicable provisions of the Code, ERISA
and all other applicable Laws have been made or taken except to the extent
that such amendments or actions are not required by Law to be made or taken
until a date after the Closing.   (k) All Existing Target Options have been
granted with an exercise price per share no lower than the "fair market
value" (as defined in the applicable Stock Option Plan) of one share of
Target Common Stock on the date of the corporate action effectuating the
grant. All Existing Target Options were validly issued and properly approved
by the Board of Directors of Target (or a duly authorized committee or
subcommittee thereof) in material compliance with all applicable Law and
recorded on the Target Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.  4.14

respect to each Target Contract and except as disclosed in Section 4.14(a) of
the Target Disclosure Memorandum: (A) the Contract is in full force and
effect, is a valid and binding obligation of Target or the Target Subsidiary
party thereto and, to the Target\'s Knowledge, each other party thereto; (B)
neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary is in Default nor has received any

as noted in Section 4.14(a) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum. No other  
30   party has provided any notice of any intention to terminate any Target

of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, that would
result in or permit a termination thereof, except for terminations which are
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Target
Material Adverse Effect. Target has, prior to the date of this Agreement,
provided or made available to Buyer true, correct and complete copies of all
Target Contracts together with all amendments and supplements thereto in
effect as of the date hereof. Section 4.14(a) of the Target Disclosure
Memorandum sets forth a complete and accurate list of Target\'s outstanding
Indebtedness as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement,
"Indebtedness" means, without duplication, (i) all indebtedness, notes
payable (including, without limitation, notes payable in connection with
acquisitions), accrued interest payable or other obligations of Target and
its Subsidiaries for borrowed money, whether current, short-term, or long-
term, secured or unsecured, other than intercompany indebtedness, (ii)
all indebtedness of Target and its Subsidiaries for the deferred purchase

into or is subject, directly or indirectly, to any "Tax Protection
Agreements" (except as set forth in Section 4.14(b) of the Target Disclosure
Memorandum, true and correct copies of which have been made available to
Buyer). As used herein, a "Tax Protection Agreement" is an agreement, oral or
written, (A) that (i) prohibits or restricts in any manner the disposition of
any Assets of Target or any Target Subsidiary, (ii) requires that Target or
any Target Subsidiary maintain, put in place, or replace, Indebtedness,
whether or not secured by one or more of Target\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' properties, or (iii) requires that Target or any Target
Subsidiary offer to any Person at any time the opportunity to guarantee or
otherwise assume, directly or indirectly (including a "bottom" guarantee,
indemnification agreement or other similar arrangement), the risk of loss for
federal income tax purposes for Indebtedness or other liabilities of Target
or any Target Subsidiary, (B) that specifies or relates to a method of taking
into account book-tax disparities under Section 704(c) of the Code with
respect to one or more Assets of Target or a Target Subsidiary, or (C) that
requires a particular method for allocating one or more liabilities of Target
or any Target Subsidiary under Section 752 of the Code. Neither Target nor
any Target Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under any
Tax Protection Agreement, and no Person has asserted, or to the Knowledge of
Target threatened to assert, a material claim against Target or any Target
Subsidiary for any violation of any Tax Protection Agreement.   (c) Except
as set forth in Section 4.14(c) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, neither
Target nor any Target Subsidiary is a party to any agreement relating to the
development or management of any Target Property by any Person other than
Target or a Target Subsidiary.   (d) Section 4.14(d) of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum lists all agreements currently in force and effect
entered into by Target or any Target Subsidiary providing for the  
31   sale of, or option to sell, any Target Property or the purchase of, or
option to purchase, by Target or any Target Subsidiary, on the one hand, or
the other party thereto, on the other hand, any real estate not yet
consummated as of the date hereof.   (e) Except as set forth in Section
4.14(e) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, neither Target nor any Target
Subsidiary is subject to any pending claims or, to the Knowledge of Target,
any threatened claims regarding material continuing contractual liability (A)
for indemnification under any agreement relating to the sale of real estate
previously owned, whether directly or indirectly, by Target or any Target
Subsidiary, (B) to pay any additional purchase price for any Target Property
or (C) with respect to any indebtedness which encumbered any real estate that
has been conveyed, except for any indebtedness under the Loan
Documents.  4.15 Legal Proceedings.   Except as disclosed in Section 4.15
of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, there is no Litigation instituted or
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Target, threatened (or unasserted but
considered probable of assertion) against or affecting Target or any Target
Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee in their capacities as such
or Employee Benefit Plan of Target or any Target Subsidiary, or any Asset,
interest, or right of any of them, or for which Target is required to
indemnify any third party or any Orders outstanding that would reasonably be
expected to (i) prevent or materially delay Target from performing its
obligations under this Agreement or taking any action necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) be material to Target and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  4.16 Reports.   Since January 1, 2003 or
the date of organization if later, Target and each Target Subsidiary has
filed all material reports and documents, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to file with
Regulatory Authorities (except for Target SEC Reports which are the subject
of the representation and warranty contained in Section 4.5 or reports and
documents which the failure to file have not had and are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse
Effect). As of their respective dates, each of such reports and documents,
including the financial statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied
in all material respects with all applicable Laws. As of its respective date,
each such report and document did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  4.17
Inapplicability of Takeover Statutes, Rights Agreement and Certain Charter
and Bylaw Provisions.   Target has taken all appropriate and necessary
actions to exempt the Merger, the OP Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from the restrictions of Subtitles 6, 7 and
8 of Title 3 of the MGCL (collectively, the "Takeover Statutes"). No other
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover
Laws apply to the   32   Merger, the OP Merger, this Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Target and Target Board of Directors
have taken all appropriate and necessary actions to (i) render the rights
under the Rights Agreement and the rights governed by Article 16 of the
Target OP Agreement (collectively, the "Purchase Rights") inapplicable in the
Merger, the OP Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated
thereby, (ii) cause the Merger, the OP Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to comply with or be exempted from any
provision contained in the Target Charter, Target Bylaws or in the comparable
organizational document of any Target Subsidiary that would otherwise
prohibit, hinder or delay such transactions and (iii) render any and all
limitations on ownership of (X) shares of Target Common Stock as set forth in
the Target Charter and (Y) the limited partner interests in Target Operating
Partnership as set forth in the Target OP Agreement, including the ownership
limit set forth in the Target Charter inapplicable to the Merger, the OP
Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated
thereby.  4.18 Regulatory Matters.   Neither Target nor any Target
Subsidiary or any officer or director thereof has taken or agreed to take any
action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably
likely to materially impede or delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory
Authorities referred to in Section 8.1(b).  4.19 INTENTIONALLY
OMITTED.  4.20 Opinion of Financial Advisor.   The Board of Directors of
Target has received an opinion of Banc of America Securities LLC, financial
advisor to the Target (the "Target Financial Advisor"), a signed copy of
which will be delivered to Buyer solely for informational purposes after
receipt thereof by the Board of Directors, to the effect that, as of the date
of this Agreement, the Common Stock Price Per Share to be received in the
Merger by the holders of Target Common Stock (other than Buyer and its
affiliates) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Target
has received Target Financial Advisor\'s consent to include a signed copy of
the opinion in the Proxy Statement.  4.21 Investment Company Act of
1940.    Neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary is, or at the Merger
Effective Time of the Merger will be, required to be registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  4.22 Related-Party
Transactions.   Except as disclosed in Section 4.22 of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum, since January 1, 2003, neither Target nor any Target
Subsidiary has entered into any agreement, understanding, relationship or
transaction with or for the benefit of any officer, director, employee or
Affiliate of Target and its Subsidiaries or any member of the "immediate
family" (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act) of the foregoing or any entity of which any of the foregoing
is an Affiliate of a sort that would be required to be disclosed by Target
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act or which  
33   provides for a direct or indirect interest in the Target\'s property
or the business of Target\'s competitors, customers or suppliers, except for
those matters that have been disclosed in SEC Documents filed prior to the
date of this Agreement.  4.23 Insurance.   Target and the Target
Subsidiaries maintain insurance policies that are of the type and in amounts
customarily carried by Persons conducting businesses similar to those of
Target and the Target Subsidiaries. A complete list of all material insurance
policies is set forth in Section 4.23 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum,
and Target has made available to Buyer correct and complete copies of all
such material insurance policies, including, general liability policies,
comprehensive general liability and umbrella insurance policies maintained as
of the date hereof by Target and any Target Subsidiary (the "Insurance
Policies"), together with descriptions of "self-insurance" programs. All
Insurance Policies are valid and enforceable and in full force and effect
(except as the enforceability of any such policy may be limited by
the insurer\'s bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors\' rights generally or by general equitable
principles) and all premiums owing in respect thereof have been timely paid.
Except as set forth in Section 4.23 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum and
for any matters which will not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Target Material Adverse Effect, there are no material
claims pending under any of the Insurance Policies as to which the insurer
has denied liability or is reserving its rights, and all claims have been
timely and properly filed. Except as set forth in Section 4.23 of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum, within the last three years, neither Target nor any
Target Subsidiary has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied
for, and Target has no reason to believe that the existing insurance coverage
of Target and the Target Subsidiaries cannot be renewed as and when the same
shall expire, upon terms and conditions standard in the market at the time
renewal is sought.  4.24 Intellectual Property.   (a) Section 4.24(a) of
the Target Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true, correct, and complete
list of all U.S. and foreign (i) issued Patents and Patent applications, (ii)
Trademark registrations and applications and material unregistered
trademarks, (iii) copyright registrations and applications and material
unregistered copyrights, and (iv) Software, in each case which is owned or
purported to be owned by the Target or any Target Subsidiary. To
Target\'s Knowledge, The Target or a Target Subsidiary is the sole and
exclusive beneficial and record owner of all of the Intellectual Property
items set forth in Section 4.24 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, and all
such Intellectual Property is subsisting, valid, and enforceable.   (b)
Except as disclosed in Section 4.24(b) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum,
(a) the Target and Target Subsidiaries own, or have a valid right to use,
free and clear of all Encumbrances, all Intellectual Property used or
held for use in, or necessary to conduct, the respective businesses of the
Target and the Target Subsidiaries, (b) the conduct of the business of the
Target and the Target Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe,
misappropriate, or otherwise violate any Person\'s Intellectual Property
rights, and there has been no such claim asserted or threatened in the past
three (3) years against the Target or any Target Subsidiary, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Target, does there exist a valid basis for any such claim,
and (c) to the    34   Knowledge of the Target, no Person is infringing,
misappropriating, or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned,
used, or held for use by the Target or any Target Subsidiary, and no such
claims have been asserted or threatened against any Person by the Target or
any Target Subsidiary in the past three (3) years.  4.25 Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act.   The transactions contemplated hereby are
exempt from any requirement to make any filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the implementing
regulations thereto, because (a) Target is a REIT and (b) Target has
determined that the aggregate fair market value of the non-exempt assets of
Target and the entities controlled by Target is less then $56.7
million.  4.26 Internal Controls.   (a) Target and each of its officers
and directors are in compliance with, and have complied, in all material
respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the related rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the AMEX. Target has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act. Target\'s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Target in
the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to Target\'s management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   (b)
Target has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Target\'s
outside auditors, the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Target and
to Buyer (x) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to
materially affect Target\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, known to
management that involves management or other employees who, in each case,
have a significant role in the Target\'s internal control over financial
reporting. There have been no significant changes since January 1, 2006 in
Target\'s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect Target\'s internal controls, or any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in such internal controls requiring corrective actions.
Target has delivered to Buyer complete and accurate copies of notices
received from its independent auditor of any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in Target\'s internal control over financial reporting
since January 1, 2006 and any other management letter or similar
correspondence from any independent auditor of Target or any of Target\'s
Subsidiaries received since January 1, 2006.   35   4.27 Deficit

any Target Subsidiary (other than to a Target Subsidiary that is wholly owned

written notice promptly to the other upon becoming aware of the occurrence or
impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of
its Subsidiaries which (i) is reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, in the case of Target, a Target Material Adverse Effect and in
the case of Buyer, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (ii) if

the dates indicated and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders\' equity, and cash flows for the periods then ended in
accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to
normal recurring year-end adjustments that are not material). As of their
respective dates, such reports filed with the SEC will comply in all material
respects with the Securities Laws and will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any financial
statements contained in any other reports to another Regulatory Authority
shall be prepared in accordance with Laws applicable to such reports.  
ARTICLE VII   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  7.1 Proxy Statement; Stockholder

this Agreement prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement with respect
to the meeting of the stockholders of Target in connection with the Merger
(the "Proxy Statement"), and Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto. Each Party shall notify the applicable counterparties promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and or any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Target will provide Buyer and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement and any supplement or amendment
thereof, and Target shall give due regard to such comments. Target agrees
that (i) none of the information with respect to the Target or its
Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and
at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If
at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Target Vote there shall occur
any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, Target shall promptly inform Buyer and provide Buyer and its
counsel with a    44   reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such amendment or supplement and give due regard to such comments and prepare
and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. Target shall
not file with the SEC or mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, to which Buyer reasonably objects.   (b) As promptly as
practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Target,
acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable
Law, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders, which meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, for the purpose of considering
and taking action upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and
Target agrees that this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted at such
meeting. Except as permitted by Section 7.2(b), Target shall, through its
Board of Directors, include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of
the Board of Directors that the stockholders of Target approve the Merger and
this Agreement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
approval (including the solicitation of proxies to be exercised in favor of
the Agreement and the Merger).   (c) Buyer agrees that none of the
information with respect to Buyer or its Subsidiaries supplied by or on
behalf of Buyer to be included in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of
the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto,
and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time
prior to the Stockholders Meeting any event or circumstances relating to
Buyer, or its respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Buyer
that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, Buyer shall promptly inform Target (which shall file such
amendment or supplement with the SEC).  7.2 Other Offers, Etc.   (a)
Target and each Target Subsidiary shall, and shall cause each of their

any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such parties in possession of confidential information about Target
that was furnished by or on behalf of Target to return or destroy all such
information in the possession of such third party or its officers, directors,
Affiliates, employees or Representatives (it being understood and agreed that
any such request to return or destroy information shall not be deemed to
revoke any invitation previously made by Target to any third party to make an
Acquisition Proposal). Target and each Target Subsidiary shall not take, and
shall cause its Affiliates and each of their respective officers and
directors not to take, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its employees and Representatives not to take, any action directly or
indirectly to (i) solicit, initiate or induce the making or submission of any

arrangement or understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other

publicly announce an intention to approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal) or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding that would require Target to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) initiate or participate in any way in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any nonpublic information to, or
afford access to any of the properties, Assets, books or records of Target or

any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar provision (whether in a separate agreement, a
confidentiality agreement or otherwise) with respect to Target or any Target
Subsidiary other than a waiver or release limited to permitting another
Person to initiate (by means of written correspondence to the Board of
Directors of Target) nonpublic negotiations or discussions that are permitted
by the proviso below; provided, that so long as there has been no material
breach of this Section 7.2(a), prior to the Stockholders Meeting, Target, in
response to an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited from the date
hereof by Target or any Target Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, Affiliates or Representatives, may request
clarifications from, furnish information to, or enter into negotiations or
discussions with, any Person which makes such unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal if (A) such action is taken subject to a confidentiality agreement
with Target containing customary terms and conditions and which does not
contain any terms that would prevent Target from complying with
its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.2; except that if such
confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive than
the comparable provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, or omits
restrictive provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, then the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended to
contain in substitution for such comparable provisions such less restrictive
provisions, or to omit such restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and
in connection with the foregoing, Target agrees not to waive any of the
provisions in any such confidentiality agreement without waiving the similar
provisions in the Confidentiality Agreements to the same extent, (B) Target
complies in all material respects with the provisions of Section 7.2(c)
hereof and (C) the Board of Directors of Target reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with an independent nationally recognized

Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in
a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the Board of
Directors of Target may authorize a communication with any party that is
limited to making such party aware of the existence of this Agreement, and
(2) a director, officer, employee or Representative of Target or a Target
Subsidiary may respond to an unsolicited communication by making such party
aware that such director, officer, employee or Representative may not
communicate with such party unless such party has first contacted the Board
of Directors of Target in writing and the Board of Directors
subsequently authorizes further communication.   (b) Neither the Board of
Directors of Target nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, withhold or
modify, or propose to withdraw, withhold or modify, in a manner adverse to
Buyer, the approval, adoption or recommendation, as the case may be, of the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
(a "Target Change of Recommendation"), or resolve to do any of the foregoing;
provided, that the Board of Directors of Target may effect a Target Change of
Recommendation prior to the Stockholders Meeting if (A) Target shall have
given Buyer two (2) Business Days\' written notice of its intention to effect
a Target Change of Recommendation and (B) the Board of Directors of Target,
in its good faith   46   judgment and after being advised by reputable
outside counsel experienced in such matters, shall have determined that the
failure to take such action would result in a breach of the Board of
Directors\' duties to Target\'s stockholders under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.2(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Target may take and
disclose to the Target stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Alternative
Proposal, or making any other disclosure to the Target\'s stockholders if,
the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after receipt
of advice from reputable outside legal counsel experienced in such matters)
that there is a reasonable basis to conclude disclosure is required under
applicable Law.   (c) Target shall promptly (and in any event within two (2)
days of the receipt thereof) notify Buyer (in writing) after: (i) receipt of
an Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of such offeror, a copy of
such Acquisition Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal was not made in
writing, a summary of the terms of such Acquisition Proposal), (ii) any
request for information relating to the Target (including nonpublic
information) or for access to the properties, books or records of the Target
by any Person that has made an inquiry that could reasonably lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) receipt of an amendment to a previously
disclosed Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of such offeror, a
copy of such amendment or, if such amendment was not made in writing, a
summary of the terms of such amendment). In addition, Target shall inform
Buyer within two (2) days with respect to any material development relating
to such Acquisition Proposal, including the entering into of discussions or
negotiations, and any results of any discussions or negotiations (including
any changes in material terms or conditions based thereon), with respect
thereto. Target shall (within two (2) days that such information or access is
provided to such third party) provide Buyer with all material information or
access provided to any third party that has not previously been provided to
Buyer regardless of whether Buyer previously requested such information
(regardless of whether such information has been previously provided to
Buyer). In the event of any Target Change of Recommendation, Target
shall provide Buyer with the Target\'s stockholder lists and allow and
facilitate Buyer\'s contact with Target\'s stockholders and prospective
investors and following a Target Change in Recommendation such contacts may
be made without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 7.5.   (d)

(including the Merger and the OP Merger). The Parties agree that they will
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Consents of all
Regulatory Authorities and other Persons necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions   47   contemplated by this Agreement and each Party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the
transactions contemplated herein. Each Party also shall promptly advise the
other upon receiving any communication from any Regulatory Authority whose
Consent is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any requisite Consent will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed.  7.4 Consents of
Third Parties.   The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents set

purpose of conducting environmental site assessments, which may include, at
Buyer\'s sole discretion, Phase I environmental site assessments, and
if conditions are revealed, or recommendations made in any Phase I report or
any update thereto, Buyer may, subject to Target\'s reasonable approval and
upon such conditions as Target may reasonably impose, also conduct Phase II
environmental site assessments at any such locations (the usage of the terms
"Phase I" and "Phase II" in this Agreement shall be as defined by ASTM). The
Target shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause Target Subsidiaries to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and the environmental consultants in
connection with the completion of the Phase I and Phase II environmental
assessments and related activities, including making knowledgeable Target
representatives available, and will permit such consultants access to the
facilities of the Target and its Subsidiaries consistent with this Section
7.6 provided such assess shall not unreasonably interfere with rights of
tenants or the operation of business at the Target Property. Copies of the
resulting environmental assessment reports (including any drafts thereof) and

representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or relieve any
party of any breach of any such representation or warranty.  7.7 Press
Releases.   Target and Buyer shall mutually agree upon the form and
substance of the initial press release related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Target
and Buyer shall consult with each other as to the form and substance of, and
provide each other with advance review of, any and all subsequent press
releases or other public disclosures materially related to this Agreement or
any other transaction contemplated hereby; provided, that nothing in this
Section 7.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from the prompt filing of
this Agreement as an exhibit on the Form 8-K filed pursuant to Item 1.01
thereof or making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or
advisable in order to satisfy such Party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by
Law.  7.8 Employee Benefits and Contracts.   (a) Immediately prior to the
Closing Date, Target shall pay the amounts due to such of Target\'s senior
executive officers under such senior executive officers\' employment
agreements, which agreements are set forth in Section 7.8 of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum to the extent such agreements are not superseded
effective as of the Closing Date.   (b) Target and each Target Subsidiary
shall take all actions as may be necessary under the Stock Option Plan to
effect the cancellations described in Section 2.4. In addition to the
foregoing and subject to the terms of the Stock Option Plan and applicable
Law, Target shall take all actions necessary to cause the Stock Option Plan
to be terminated at or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, and to
reasonably satisfy Buyer that no holder of Existing Target Options or other
awards under such plans or programs or participant in the Stock Option Plan,
will have any right to acquire any interest in the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer, including Buyer Acquisition Entity, as a
result of the exercise of Existing   49   Target Options or other awards
or rights pursuant to such Stock Option Plan at or after the Merger Effective
Time.   (c) For a period of not less than one year commencing
immediately following the Merger Effective Time, Buyer shall, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide to each employee of Target or a Target
Subsidiary who remains employed by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Partnership after the Merger Effective Time (a "Target Employee")
compensation and employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation)
that are substantially equivalent, in the aggregate, to the compensation and
employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation, retention, sale,
stay, special bonus or other change-in-control payments or awards) provided
by Target immediately before the Merger Effective Time. If any Target
Employee becomes a participant in an Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates ("Buyer Plans"), in accordance with the
eligibility criteria of such Buyer Plans, (i) such participants shall receive
full credit for all service with Target and Target Subsidiaries prior to the
Merger Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accrual), to the extent such service is taken into account under such
Buyer Plans, (ii) such participants shall participate in the Buyer Plans on
terms no less favorable than those offered by Buyer or its significant
Affiliates to their similarly-situated employees, and (iii) with respect to
any Buyer Plan that provides medical or health benefits, such Target
Employees (and their eligible dependents) shall be given credit for co-
payments made, amounts credited towards deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-
pocket maximums under the corresponding Target Employee Benefit Plan in the
year in which such Target Employee becomes a participant in such Buyer Plans.
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, preserve and
provide all vacation, sick leave and paid time off accrued by each Target
Employee under Target Employee Benefit Plans prior to the Merger Effective
Time.  7.9 Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance.   (a)
For a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors and officers of Target and each Target Subsidiary (each,
an "Indemnified Party") against all Liabilities arising out of actions or
omissions arising out of the Indemnified Party\'s service or services as
directors and officers of Target and each Target Subsidiary (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent required
under Maryland Law, by Target\'s Charter and Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof and by the terms of any agreement between Target and an Indemnified
Party set forth in Section 7.8 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the defense of any
Litigation and whether or not the Surviving Corporation is insured against
any such matter.   (b) With respect to acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Merger Effective Time, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall, until the sixth anniversary of the Merger Effective Time and for so
long thereafter as any claim for insurance coverage asserted on or prior to
such date has not been fully adjudicated, cause to be maintained in effect,
at no cost to the beneficiaries thereof, to the extent available, the
policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by
Target as of the date hereof or purchase "tail period" coverage for such six-
year period to the extent that such insurance coverage can be maintained at
an annual cost to the Surviving Corporation of not greater than 250% of the
annual premium for Target\'s current    50   insurance policies and, if
such insurance coverage cannot be so purchased or maintained at such cost,
providing as much of such insurance as can be so purchased or maintained at
such cost.   (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume its obligations set forth in this Section
7.8.  7.10 Stockholder Claims.   Target shall (i) promptly notify Buyer of
any action, suit, charge, complaint, grievance or proceeding commenced, or to
Target\'s Knowledge, threatened against Target or any Target Subsidiary
which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to the terms hereof or which relates to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) give Buyer the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against Target and its directors relating to the Merger or any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Buyer\'s consent, which consent may be
granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Buyer.  7.11 Delisting.  
Each Party agrees to cooperate with each other in taking, or causing to be
taken, all actions necessary to delist Target Common Stock from the AMEX
and to terminate registration under the Exchange Act; provided, that such
delisting and termination shall not be effective until the Merger Effective
Time.  7.12 Takeover Statutes.   If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Target and Buyer and their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.  7.13
Financing   Target shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement
of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer. Such cooperation by
Target shall include, at the reasonable request of Buyer, (i) agreeing to
enter into such customary agreements, and using commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver such customary officer\'s certificates and opinions as are
requested by Buyer, (ii) agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in, and
otherwise grant liens on, Target\'s assets pursuant to such agreements as may
be reasonably requested, provided that no obligation of Target under any such
agreement, pledge or   51   grant shall be effective until the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, (iii) participating in meetings, "road
shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (iv) using commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare or participate in the preparation of business projections
and financial statements for inclusion in offering documents, (v) causing its
independent accountants and in-house general counsel to provide assistance to
Buyer and (vi) providing to the Buyer\'s lenders financial and other
information in Target\'s possession with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, making Target\'s senior officers available to assist
such lenders and otherwise reasonably cooperating in connection with
the consummation of the Financing.  7.14 Section 16 Matters.   Prior to
the Merger Effective Time, Target shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to approve in advance, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, any dispositions of shares of
Target Common Stock or Target OP Units (Common) (including
derivative securities with respect to Target Common Stock or Target OP Units
(Common)) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each officer or director of Target who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as
a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to equity
securities of Target.  7.15 Transfer Taxes.   Buyer and Target shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions
to Tax, "Transfer Taxes"), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer
Taxes, without deduction or withholding from the Common Stock Price Per
Share.  7.16 Special Dividend.   (a) No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Target shall deliver to Buyer a
certificate (the "FFO Certificate") setting forth Target\'s calculation of
the Distributable FFO Amount (together with all supporting documentation),
estimated as of the close of business on the last Business Day immediately
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, together with a report thereon from
the principal financial officer of Target stating that (i) the FFO
Certificate was prepared in good faith and in accordance (except for
adjustments with respect to the Transaction Fees and Expenses) with the
accounting principles, policies and practices used by Target for the
calculation of FFO (as such term is defined in Target\'s Annual Report
on 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005) and (ii) in the judgment
of the principal financial officer of Target, the FFO Certificate fairly
presents the Distributable FFO Amount, in each case, estimated as of the
close of business on the last Business Day immediately prior to the
anticipated Closing Date. Buyer and its Representatives shall be afforded a
reasonable opportunity to review the books and records, supporting
documentation and   52   calculations used by Target to prepare the FFO
Certificate. Unless reasonably objected to by Buyer, the FFO Certificate
shall be binding on Target for purposes of calculating the Special Dividend.
In the event Buyer objects to the FFO Certificate as provided above, Target
and Buyer shall resolve such objection in a mutually agreeable manner. The
Distributable FFO Amount, as modified by any mutual agreement of Target and
Buyer, shall be the final and binding determination of the Distributable FFO
Amount (such amount, the "Final Distributable FFO Amount").   (b)
Immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Target, in accordance with Law and Target\'s Charter and Bylaws,
shall set a record date for, and declare payable, a special dividend (the
"Special Dividend") on each share of Target Common Stock and OP Unit, in each
case, outstanding as of the close of business on such date, in an
amount equal to the Final Distributable Amount divided by the aggregate
number of shares of Target Common Stock and OP Units, in each case,
outstanding as of such date; provided, that, in no event shall the Special
Dividend exceed an amount per share of Target Common Stock or OP Unit, as
applicable, equal to $0.26 multiplied by the quotient equal to (i) the number
of days between the last day of the last quarter for which full quarterly
dividends on the shares of Target Common Stock have been declared and paid
and the Closing Date (including the Closing Date) divided by (ii) the total
number of days in the quarter in which the Closing Date occurs.   (c) At or
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Target shall provide to the
Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to satisfy the Special Dividend (as
determined in accordance with Section 7.16(b) above) to be distributed to the
holders of Target Common Stock and OP Units in a manner consistent with the
payment of Target\'s regular quarterly dividend.  7.17 Form of Election.  
(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Buyer
shall prepare a form of election, which form shall be reasonably acceptable
to Target, as the general partner of Target Operating Partnership (the "Form
of Election"). The Form of Election may be used by each holder of Target OP
Units to affirmatively designate such holder\'s election to exchange all, but
not less than all, of such holders\' Target OP Units for (i) Preferred Units
or (ii) Continuing Units, in each case, in lieu of the Partnership
Merger Consideration.   (b) If Buyer delivers an Election Notice to Target
pursuant to Section 2.2(b) stating its intention to effect the OP Merger
pursuant to the Election, then concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to Target\'s stockholders, Buyer shall mail Forms of Election to
each holder of Target OP Units, together with any other materials that Target
and Buyer mutually determine to be necessary or prudent. Any such holder\'s
election to receive either Preferred Units or Continuing Units shall be
effective only if a properly executed Form of Election is received by Buyer
prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the Business Day preceding the
Stockholders Meeting. If a holder of Target OP Units fails to return a duly
completed Form of Election within the time period specified above, such
holder shall be deemed to have elected to convert each such holder\'s Target
OP Units into the right to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration upon
the conversion thereof in the OP Merger. The reasonable determination of
Buyer shall be binding as to whether or not elections to receive Preferred
Units or Continuing Units have been properly made. If Buyer determines that
any election to receive Preferred Units   53   or Continuing Units, as
applicable, was not properly made, the Target OP Units with respect to which
such election was not properly made shall be converted into the Partnership
Merger Consideration upon the conversion thereof in the OP Merger. Buyer and
Target by mutual agreement shall have the right to make rules, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity
of Forms of Election and the issuance of Preferred Units or Continuing Units,
as applicable, in the OP Merger.   (c) Each holder of Target OP Units, as a
condition to making a valid Election with respect to such holder\'s Target OP
Units, shall (i) represent to Buyer that such holder is an "accredited
investor" (within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act) and (ii) agree to be bound by the terms of the limited
partnership agreement of the Surviving Partnership as it will be in effect
immediately following the Partnership Merger Effective Time (which agreement
shall incorporate the terms of the Preferred Units).   (d) Target agrees to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in preparing any disclosure statement or
other information to accompany the Form of Election.   ARTICLE VIII

Affiliates), except (i) that the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
this Section 9.2 and Article X will continue to apply following any such
termination, (ii) that, except as provided in Section 8.2(b), nothing
contained herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for willful
breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement or fraud and (iii) as provided in paragraph (b) below.  
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to:   (i) Sections 9.1(b) (provided, that the breach giving rise to  such
termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b) was willful), 9.1(d)(i),  9.1(e) or
9.1(f) and (A) at any time after the date hereof, an  Acquisition Proposal is

(i) of this Section 9.2(b), upon the earlier to occur of the execution of
such definitive agreement or the consummation of such Qualifying Transaction
or (2) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section
9.2(b), concurrently with such termination, pay to Buyer a fee in the amount
of $12,500,000 (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer or by a bank
guaranteed check if Buyer fails to designate an account. If Target fails to
promptly pay the Termination Fee in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment Buyer commences a suit
which results in a judgment against Target for the payment of the Termination
Fee, Target shall pay to Buyer its costs and expenses (including attorneys\'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on any unpaid
amount of the Termination Fee at a rate equal to 2% plus the prime lending
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal for the last Business Day prior
to the date of payment, calculated on a daily basis from the date such
amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.   (c)
Target acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and not a
penalty, and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement.   58   9.3 Non-Survival of Representations and Covenants.
