further right to appeal that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article NINTH; and provided further that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article NINTH if it is determined

Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless (i)&nbsp;the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 of this Article NINTH (and none of the circumstances described in Section&nbsp;4 of this Article NINTH that would
nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii)&nbsp;the Corporation determines within such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">60-day</FONT> period that Indemnitee did not meet
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1, 2 or 5 of this Article NINTH, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section&nbsp;1 or 2 only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1 or 2, as the case may be. Such
determination shall be made in each instance (a)&nbsp;by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (&#147;<B>disinterested
directors</B>&#148;), whether or not a quorum, (b)&nbsp;by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c)&nbsp;if there are no disinterested directors, or if the

action in Indemnitee&#146;s official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
