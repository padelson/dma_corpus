of such outstanding shares), (iv) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or

 Proposal Notice") stating that the Company Board intends to take such action
and (in the event the Company Board contemplates causing the Company to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement) including a copy of such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and the identity of the potential
counterparty to such Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (D) __ during the
three (3) __ Business Day period commencing on the date of Parents receipt
of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall have made its
representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or a possible
alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject
of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal; (E) after
the expiration of the negotiation period described in clause "(D)" above, the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith,
after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that
Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result
of the negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that (1) __ after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (2) __ after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, the failure to make a
Change in Recommendation and/or enter into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law; and (F) __ if the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement concerning such Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_; _provided_ , however, that, if

2.3(d)(i)_ with respect to any Superior Proposal any material revisions are
made to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new

this _Section 2.3(d)(i)_, except that references to three (3) __ Business
Days shall be deemed to be two (2) __ Business Days; or

 

(ii) make a Change in Recommendation not related to an Acquisition Proposal
if: (A) any change in circumstances arises affecting the Company that does
not relate to any Acquisition Proposal and was not known to (or reasonably
foreseeable by) the Company Board on or prior to the date hereof (any such
change in circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred
to as a "Change in Circumstances"); (B) the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect
a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law; (C) __ such Change in Recommendation is not effected
prior to the third Business Day after Parent receives written notice (the
"Change in Circumstance Notice") from the Company confirming that the Company
Board intends to effect such Change in Recommendation and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor; (D) __ during such three (3) __
Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement or the Offer or enter into
an alternative transaction; and (E) __ at the end of such three (3) __
Business Day period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after
taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that Parent
and Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the
negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that, in light of such
Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(e) In connection with the Offer, as requested by Parent, the Company shall
promptly furnish, and shall instruct its transfer agent to furnish, to Merger
Sub, a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or

(c) Immediately prior the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock
Award that is outstanding shall be deemed fully vested and shall be treated
under this Article 3 the same as other Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent payable to a current or
former employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, such payments
(the "Restricted Stock Payment") shall be made by the Surviving Corporation
through its payroll system and shall be subject to applicable tax
withholdings.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all such
actions as are necessary (under the Company Equity Incentive Plans,

and treat the Current Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed
offering period for all purposes of the ESPP, and all outstanding purchase
rights under the ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance with the

4.8(a)(iii)_ had they been in effect on the date hereof;

Section 6.2. _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company will not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers and directors not to, and will not authorize any of
its or their other Representatives to:

 

(i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage the submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including by
approving any transaction, or approving any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder," for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL);

 

(ii) furnish any non-public information regarding any Acquired Company to
any Person for the purpose of encouraging, or in response to, an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or

 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry;

_provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may engage in any such
discussions or negotiations and provide any such information in response to a
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal first made after the date hereof that
did not result from a material breach of this  _Section 6.2(a)_, if: (A)
prior to providing any material non-public information regarding any Acquired
Company to any Third Party in response to such an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company receives from such Third Party (or there is then in effect with such
party) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and (B) the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. Prior to or concurrent
with providing any non-public information to such Third Party, the Company
shall make such non-public information available to Parent (to the extent
such non-public information has not been previously made available by the
Company to Parent or Parents representatives). Prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Company will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive,
any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits or
purports to prohibit an Acquisition Proposal being made to the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) if the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(b) If an Acquired Company or Representative thereof receives
an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall promptly
(and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) notify Parent in writing of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (which notification shall include
the material terms and conditions thereof), and shall thereafter keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material change to the terms of such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall, and shall ensure that its
Representatives, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; _provided,
however_ , that the foregoing shall not in any way limit or modify any of the
Companys rights under the other provisions of this  _Section 6.2_ or
_Section 2.3(d)_.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) or their Representatives from: (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of
its position thereunder (or any substantially similar communication);
_provided_ that any such disclosure does not contain an express Change in
Recommendation; (ii) disclosing to the Companys stockholders any factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has 

 



39

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 been made, the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (and no such disclosure shall,
taken by itself, be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation); or (iii)
communicating with any Person (or the representatives of such Person) that
makes any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry to the extent necessary
to direct such Person to the provisions of this  _Section 6.2_ and/or to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal
made by such Person; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board shall not
make any Change in Recommendation except in accordance with  _Section 2.3_.

Section 6.3. _Filings; Other Action_.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly (and, in
the case of the notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties hereto, in no event later than the date that
is five (5) Business Days after the date hereof) use reasonable best efforts
to make and effect all registrations, filings and submissions required to be
made or effected by it or otherwise advisable pursuant to the HSR Act, other
applicable Antitrust Laws, the Exchange Act and other applicable Law with
respect to the Offer and the Merger; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all consents and approvals required from Third Parties in connection
with the Transactions; and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be
taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the
purpose of consummating and effectuating the Transactions; _provided, however_
, that in no event shall the Company be required to pay, prior to the
Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other consideration to any Person for any
consent or approval required for the consummation of any of the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (A)
shall promptly use its best efforts to provide all information requested by
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of
the other Transactions and (B) shall use its best efforts to promptly take,
and cause its Affiliates to take, all actions and steps necessary to obtain
and secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws and obtain any clearance
or approval required to be obtained from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,
the U.S. Department of Justice, any state attorney general, any foreign
competition authority or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the best efforts, reasonable best efforts, commercially reasonable
efforts or other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub shall not include, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to (and, without Parents prior
written consent, no Acquired Company shall) take, except solely with respect
to the Acquired Companies, and solely with respect to (and limited to) the
Companys developmental products and programs (other than the Company Hem A
Products) that are or would be competitive with the products and programs of
Parent and its Affiliates or in which Parent and its Affiliates own or
control any interest, any of the following actions: (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise (A) the sale, divesture, license, hold separate or other
disposition of any asset, interest or business of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates or (B) the sale, divesture, license, hold separate or other
disposition, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Effective Time, of
any asset, interest or business of the Acquired Companies; (ii) permitting the
Company and its Subsidiaries to sell, divest, license, hold separate or
otherwise dispose any of its or their assets, interests or businesses prior to
the Effective Time; (iii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying,
transferring, assigning, restructuring, or waiving existing agreements,
collaborations, relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries; and (iv) any other behavioral undertakings and commitments
whatsoever including but not limited to creating or consenting to create any
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations, or other
arrangements of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries and, in each case, to enter, or offer to enter, into agreements
and stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Governmental Entity in connection with any
of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Acquired
Companies or its or their businesses or assets, by consenting to such action
by any Acquired Company in any such case of (i)-(iv) (any of the foregoing
actions, a "Burdensome Condition"). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be required to take any actions (including any of the
actions described in clauses (i) through (iv) of the definition of Burdensome
Condition) with respect to any of the assets, interests or businesses of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective

 



40

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Affiliates. Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder, and, subject to
Parents obligations in the foregoing sentence, the Company shall not settle
or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions
without the prior written consent of Parent and, at the written request of
Parent, the Acquired Companies shall take (or agree to take) any of the
actions described in the definition of Burdensome Condition or otherwise (so
long as such action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing).

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in _Section
6.3(a)_, subject to applicable Law, each party hereto shall: (i) give the
other parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of any
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed as to the
status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any substantive or
other material communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the
U.S. Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the
Offer or the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the
other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties
in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the
other parties to be present at each substantive or other material meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding and to have reasonable access to and be consulted in connection
with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding.

 

(c) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action or Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging the Offer or the Merger
or any of the other Transactions and such litigation, action or Legal
Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use best efforts to take any and all action to resolve any
such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective best
efforts to contest any such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or the other Transactions.

(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any
rights, interests, assets, business, Person or division thereof (through
acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or
otherwise, collectively, an "Acquisition"), if such Acquisition would
reasonably be expected to increase in any material respect the risk of not
obtaining prior to the End Date any applicable clearance, consent, approval or
waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Offer or the Merger or the
other Transactions.

 

Section 6.4. _Access_. Upon reasonable advance written notice, the
Company shall afford Parents representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to
the Acquired Companies books and records and, during such period, the Company
shall furnish promptly to Parent all readily available information concerning
its business as Parent may reasonably request and the Company shall instruct
its counsel, lenders, advisors, auditors and other Representatives to
reasonably cooperate with Parents investigation of the Acquired Companies;
_provided, however_ , that the Acquired Companies shall not be required to
permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company could: (a) result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of Third Parties; (b) violate any obligation of the Acquired
Companies with respect to confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy; (c)
jeopardize protections afforded to any of the Acquired Companies under the
attorney-client privilege or the

 



41

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 attorney work product doctrine; (d) violate any Law; or (e) materially
interfere with the conduct of the Acquired Companies business; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any required consents or make alternative arrangements to permit such
inspection, access or disclosure in a manner that does not give rise to the
consequences referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (e). No
investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect any representation
or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto. All requests for access pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ must be directed to the Chief Business Officer of the Company
or another person designated in writing by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall
cause their respective representatives not to, contact any partner, licensor,
licensee, customer or supplier of the Company in connection with the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other Transactions without the Companys prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that any such
contact shall be arranged by and with a representative of the Company
participating. All information obtained by Parent and its representatives
pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be treated as confidential information
of the Acquired Companies for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 6.5. _Interim Operations of Merger Sub_. During the period from
the date hereof through the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities
of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.6. _Publicity_. The initial press release issued by each of
the Company and Parent announcing entry into this Agreement shall be issued
on the date hereof and shall be substantially the same, and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that (i) a party hereto
may, without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or Order or
the applicable rules of NASDAQ or the SIX Swiss Exchange if it has used its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties hereto and to obtain
such partys consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time
such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made,
(ii) neither the Company nor Parent will be obligated to engage in such
consultation with respect to communications that are (1) principally directed
to employees, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications
are consistent with previous releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other party),
or (2) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Change in
Recommendation or "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act made in accordance with this Agreement.

 Section 6.7. _Other Employee Benefits_.

(a) Until December 31, 2020 (or the date the applicable Continuing
Employees employment terminates, if sooner), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide to each employee of the Acquired Companies
who is employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Continuing Employee") with (i) base salary or base hourly wage rate (as
applicable), in an amount at least equal to the level that was provided to
each such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) cash incentive compensation opportunities (including bonuses and
commissions but not including equity incentive compensation) in an amount at
least equal to the level that was provided to each such Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits
that are comparable in the aggregate to such compensation and benefits as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of not less
than twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each Continuing Employee, upon a
qualifying termination of employment, severance and outplacement benefits
equal to the benefits provided under any severance plan or outplacement
arrangement maintained or provided by

 



42

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the Acquired Companies as of the date hereof that is set forth on _Section
6.7_(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Company Severance
Benefits");  _provided_ that any non-U.S. Continuing Employee shall be
entitled to severance and outplacement benefits in an amount equal to the
greater of (x) the severance benefits set forth in his or her individual
employment Contract and (y) the Company Severance Benefits (in the case of
this clause (y), without duplication with any remaining unearned notice
payments and statutory redundancy payment applicable to such non-U.S.
employee).

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure
that, as of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee receives full credit
(for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit
accrual, vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with the
Acquired Companies (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides such past service credit) under the comparable employee benefit
plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, in which such employees became participants; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to any equity
or long-term incentive plan, (ii) with respect to benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or (iii) to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits. As of the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit to Continuing
Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under
any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, with respect to each benefit plan
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation that is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA (each, a "Parent Welfare
Plan") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each such
Parent Welfare Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such
Parent Welfare Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting
periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied
or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his or
her commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan but, with
respect to long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage,
solely to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Parents
applicable insurance contracts in effect as of the Effective Time; _provided,
however_ , that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage
includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment, _Section
6.7_ _(b)_ shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in
the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee
commences participation in such Parent Welfare Plan in satisfying any
applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent
Welfare Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such
expenses were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor in accordance with their terms all deferred compensation plans,
agreements and arrangements, severance and separation pay plans, agreements
and arrangements, and all written employment, severance, retention, incentive,
change in control and termination agreements (including any change in control
provisions therein) applicable to employees of the Acquired Companies and in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(e) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company
Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective
not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time. In
the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable approval
by Parent).

(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is
intended nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any
particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or

 



43

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 terminating any of its benefit plans in accordance with their terms, (iii)
create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Acquired Company, or (iv) create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any Person with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired
Company or under any benefit plan which Parent, any Acquired Company or the
Surviving Corporation may maintain.

 Section 6.8. _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance Time,
the compensation committee of the Company Board (the "Compensation Committee")
will cause each Company Benefit Plan and Company employment agreement
pursuant to which consideration is payable to any officer, director or
employee who is a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the
Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.9. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

(a) For six (6) years after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors
liability insurance in respect of acts, errors or omissions occurring on or
before to the Acceptance Time, including in respect of the Transactions,
covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 6.9(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof for such
insurance (the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in
the Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the
Company prior to the Acceptance Time, which policies provide such persons
currently covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of
six (6) years with respect to claims arising from acts, errors or omissions
that occurred on or before the Acceptance Time, including in respect of the
Transactions; _provided, however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Acceptance Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who at the Acceptance Time is, or at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a
Subsidiary of the Company (each an "Indemnified Party") for any and all costs
and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be
advanced as they are incurred); _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall
have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 6.9(b)_, such undertaking to be unsecured, interest-free and made
without reference to the Indemnified Partys ability to repay such advances or
ultimately entitlement to indemnification), judgments, fines, penalties or
liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon
or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising
out of any demand, action, suit or other Legal Proceeding (whether civil or
criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or
she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a
participant other than as a named party, including as a witness) (an
"Indemnified Party Proceeding") (A) by reason of such Indemnified Partys
being or having been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary

 



44

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 of the Company or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken
at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (B) arising
out of such Indemnified Partys service in connection with any other
corporation or organization for which he or she serves or has served as a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of the
Company (including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit
plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues
in such position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or
threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the Acceptance Time (including
any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each indemnification
agreement in effect as of the date hereof between the Company and any
Indemnified Party; and (y) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect on the
date hereof. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by Indemnified Parties in connection with their
successful enforcement of their rights provided under this _Section 6.9_.
Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of
six (6) years from the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect
of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation fails
to comply with its obligations in this _Section 6.9(b)_ and an Indemnified
Party commences a suit which results in a determination that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation failed to comply with such obligation, Parent shall pay
such Indemnified Party his or her costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest thereon at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365
days and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding).

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or

such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by

under this _Section 6.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such

modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be

adversely affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect
to such Transaction Litigation which the Company shall consider in good faith;
_provided_ that the Company shall not settle or offer, compromise or agree to

or extend the End Date pursuant to this Section 8.1 _(b)_ shall not be
available to any party (or any Affiliate of such party) whose breach of any

has been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Acceptance
Time to have occurred on or before the End Date;

 

(c) by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the other at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time if there shall be any Law (other than an
Order, which is addressed below) in effect that makes the acceptance for
payment of, or the payment for, Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the
Offer or the Merger illegal or that prohibits the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger, or any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Entity shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order or shall have taken
any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and such Order shall have become
final and non-appealable; _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to

terminated or withdrawn prior to the Acceptance Time (to the extent permitted
under the terms of this Agreement), without Merger Sub having accepted for
payment any Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer; _provided,
however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(d)_ if the non-satisfaction of any Offer
Condition or the termination or withdrawal of the Offer results from the
failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform
any covenant required to be performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such
party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

 

(e) by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any time prior to

8.1(e)_ unless such written notice otherwise constitutes a Change in
Recommendation); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e) _unless the
notice of termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ with respect to such

and as a condition to such termination, pays to Parent the Termination Fee;

(g) by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty in

this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred that would cause
a failure of any of the conditions set forth in clauses "2(c)," "2(d)" and
"2(e)" of _Annex I_ to exist; _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of this
_Section 8.1(g)_, if such a breach is curable by the Company within twenty
(20) Business Days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach
and the Company is continuing to use reasonable best efforts to cure such
breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this  _Section
8.1(g)_ on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon
the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement

the Acceptance Time, if a breach in any material respect of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform in any material respect any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub shall have occurred, in each case if such breach or
failure prevents or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Merger
Sub from consummating the Offer, the Merger or any other Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 8.1(i)_, if such
a breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, within twenty
(20) Business Days of the date the Company gives Parent written notice of such
breach and Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, is continuing to use its
reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(i)_ on account of such
breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the expiration of such
twenty (20) Business Day period; _provided further_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(i)_ if the Company is in breach of this Agreement such that
Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(g)_ (disregarding the notice and cure rights set forth therein); or

(j) by the Company upon prior written notice to Parent if Merger Sub fails
to commence the Offer in accordance with _Section 2.1_ on or prior to the
tenth (10th) Business Day following the date hereof or if Merger Sub fails to
accept for payment the shares of Company Common Stock when required to do so
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(j)_
shall not be available to the Company if the Company is in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
that has been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, Merger Subs failure to
commence or consummate the Offer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or the Company is in breach of this Agreement such that Parent would
be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(g)_ (disregarding the notice and cure rights set forth therein).

 

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect without liability of any party (or any representative
of such party) to each other party hereto; _provided, however,_ that: (a)
this S _ection 8.2_, Article 1 and the applicable definitions elsewhere in
this Agreement, the last sentence of _Section 6.4_, _Section 8.3_ and

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

  _Article 9_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall
remain in full force and effect; and (b) the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any party from any liabilities or damages (which the
parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the
benefit of the bargain lost by such party or such partys equity holders
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including the aggregate amount of
the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration, consideration in respect
of Company Compensatory Awards, other combination opportunities and the time
value of money), which shall be deemed to be damages of such party) arising
out of its knowing and intentional material breach of any provision of this
Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith or any
fraud, subject only, with respect to any such liabilities of the Company, to
_Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.3(c)_. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that any failure
of Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy its obligation to accept for payment or pay
for Company Common Stock or the Company Compensatory Awards following
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, and any failure of Parent to cause the
Merger to be effected following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_, will be deemed to constitute a knowing and intentional material
breach of a covenant of this Agreement. The parties rights and remedies
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of
this Agreement.

 Section 8.3. _Expenses; Termination Fee_.

(a) Except as set forth in this  _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether
or not the Offer and Merger are consummated. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent shall pay all filing fees payable for filings required or otherwise
made pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, and the Company
shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments to any Governmental
Entity in connection with any filings under the HSR Act or such other filings
as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the
Merger or the other Transactions.

 

(b) If: (i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_, in each case, as
a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition, (B) following the
date hereof and prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced (and such Acquisition
Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to the time of the
termination of this Agreement) and (C) the Company consummates an Acquisition
Proposal (with all references to 20% in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal being treated as 50% for purposes of this clause "(i)") within nine
months after such termination or the Company enters into a definitive
agreement within nine months after such termination to effect an Acquisition
Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated; (ii) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_; (iii) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_; or (iv)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_, then in
the case of each of clauses "(i)" through "(iv)," the Company shall pay or
cause to be paid to Parent, in cash at the time specified in the next
sentence, a termination fee in the amount of $144,000,000 (the "Termination
Fee"). Any Termination Fee shall be paid: (x) in the case of clause "(i)"
of the preceding sentence of this (b), within two (2) Business Days after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal,
(y) in the case of clause "(ii)" or "(iv)" of the preceding sentence of this
(b), within two (2) Business Days following termination of this Agreement and
(z) in the case of clause "(iii)" of the preceding sentence of this (b),
substantially concurrently with a termination of this Agreement under
_Section 8.1(f)_ (or no later than on the next Business Day if such
termination occurs on a day that is not a Business Day).

 

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be payable
only once and not in duplication even though the Termination Fee may be
payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that Parent
shall become entitled to payment of the Termination Fee, the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Offer and the Merger (and the abandonment
thereof) or any

 matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or
any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming
the basis for such termination.

 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions,
and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not enter
into this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee when due, the Company shall also pay any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with enforcing this Agreement, together with any
interest on such unpaid Termination Fee, commencing on the date that the
Termination Fee became due, at a rate equal to the "prime rate" as published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily
on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed,
without compounding).

Section 9.10. _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger, and the other Transactions. As a material inducement to
the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Merger Sub of each of the covenants, obligations
and undertakings required to be performed by Merger Sub under this Agreement
and the Transactions, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations
contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and
agrees that any such breach of any such representation and warranty or
default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or
undertaking of Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of
Parent, and the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole
discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out
of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent
and Merger Sub in the first instance. References in this  _Section  9.10_
to "Merger Sub" shall also include the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time.

Section 9.11.   _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
except as expressly provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Courts
and, in any action for specific performance, each party waives the defense of
adequacy of a remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to
the limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.11_, a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.11_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.11_ shall
require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.11_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.11_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.11_ restrict or limit any partys
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_
or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any
time.

 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

ANNEX I

 

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not otherwise defined herein
will have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
to which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

(1) Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of the Offer or the
Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be obligated to, and Parent shall not be
required to cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably accept for payment, or, subject
to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to purchase or return the
tendered Company Common Stock promptly after termination or withdrawal of the
Offer), purchase any Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or
paid for), unless (i) there shall have been validly tendered in accordance
with the terms of the Offer (and "received" as defined in Section 251(h) of
the DGCL), and not validly withdrawn, that number of shares of Company Common
Stock that, considered together with all other shares of Company Common Stock
(if any) owned by Parent and its Affiliates (excluding any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not
yet been "received"), represent at least one more than 50% of the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
consummation of the Offer (such condition, the "Minimum Condition") and (ii)
the waiting period(s) (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws shall have expired or been terminated, and if the
parties have entered into any arrangement with any Governmental Entity
regarding the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, then the Offer and
the Merger shall have been granted clearance to be consummated from such
Governmental Entity, in each case without the imposition of a Burdensome
Condition.

 

(2) In addition and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, irrevocably accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of
Company Common Stock promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
purchase any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer) pursuant to
the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment) if at any time prior to
the expiration of the Offer, any of the following events shall have occurred
and be continuing immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer:

(a) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

(b) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law that is in effect and
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions, or any Governmental Entity has instituted
any Legal Proceeding that seeks to or that would do any of the foregoing, or
that imposes (or seeks to impose) a Burdensome Condition;

 

(c) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement shall not have been true and correct (in each case, disregarding
all qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect or similar standard or qualification) as of
the date of the Agreement and as of immediately prior to the expiration of
the Offer as though made on and as of each such date and time (except to the
extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an
earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall not have
been true and correct as of such earlier date); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the condition set
forth in this clause (2)(c)(i) shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if
any representations and warranties of the Company are not so true and correct
if the failure of such representations and warranties of the Company to be so
true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, shall not have resulted in
a Company Material Adverse Effect that has

 not been cured as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, (ii)
any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.1(a)(i)_
and _(ii)_ (Due Organization and Good Standing; Subsidiaries), _Section
4.3(g)_ (Capitalization), _Section 4.18_ (Authority; Binding Nature of
Agreement), _Section 4.19_ (No Vote Required), _Section 4.20(a)_ (Compliance
with Organizational Documents), _Section 4.21_ (Section 203 of the DGCL),
_Section 4.22_ (Opinion of Financial Advisor) or _Section 4.23_ (Brokers)
shall not have been true and correct in all material respects (with
respect to such representations and warranties that are not qualified by
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or similar standard or
qualification) or shall not have been true and correct in all respects (with
respect to such representations and warranties that are qualified by
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or similar standard or
qualification) as of the date of the Agreement and as of immediately prior to
the expiration of the Offer as though made on and as of each such date and
time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly
speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty
shall not have been true and correct as of such earlier date); or (iii)
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.3(a)_
(Capitalization) or _Section 4.5(b)_ (No Company Material Adverse Effect)
shall not have been true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as
though made on and as of such date and time (except, in each case, to the
extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an
earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall not have
so been true and correct as of such earlier date), except for _de minimis_
inaccuracies;

 

(d) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material
respects with the obligations or covenants required to be performed by it
under the Agreement and such failure to perform or comply shall not have been
cured as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer;

 

(e) the Company shall not have delivered to Parent, dated as of the
Expiration Date, a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior
executive officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth
in the foregoing clauses (2)(c), (2)(d) and 2(f) have been satisfied as of
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer; or

 

(f) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred and be
continuing any event, change, effect, occurrence, circumstance or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Except for the Minimum Condition and conditions "1(ii)", "2(a)" and "2(b)",
the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Merger Sub;
_provided_ that the Minimum Condition may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
only with the prior written consent of the Company, which may be granted or
withheld in the Companys sole discretion; and _provided further_ that any
such waiver by Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Company shall be subject to the
terms of this Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.
The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

NINTH: The Corporation shall provide indemnification as follows:

 

1. _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. 

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in
good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his
or her conduct was unlawful.

2. _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section 2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 

3. _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article NINTH, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article NINTH, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. 

 

4. _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitees right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section 4\. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at 

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by
this Article NINTH. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent
of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right
of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably
made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall
not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article NINTH for any
amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would
impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees written
consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or
delay its consent to any proposed settlement.

 

5. _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article NINTH, in the event of any threatened or pending action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article NINTH, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article NINTH; and provided further that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article NINTH if it is determined (in the manner described in Section 6) that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment. 

 

6. _Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article NINTH, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless (i) the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article NINTH (and none of the circumstances described in Section 4 of this Article NINTH that would nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii) the Corporation determines within such 60-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1, 2 or 5 of this Article NINTH, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section 1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation. 

 

7. _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article NINTH shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 of this Article NINTH that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article NINTH. Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred in 

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 connection with successfully establishing Indemnitees right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be
indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit
brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder it shall
be a defense that the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in Delaware Law.

 

8. _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article NINTH, except as set forth in Section 7 of this Article NINTH, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article NINTH in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article NINTH, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. 

9. _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article NINTH or of the relevant provisions of Delaware Law or any other applicable laws shall adversely affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. 

 

10. _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article NINTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article NINTH shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article NINTH. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article NINTH. 

 

11. _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article NINTH to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled. 

12. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under Delaware Law. 

13. _Savings Clause_. If this Article NINTH or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) and amounts paid in settlement in 

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of
the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of
this Article NINTH that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

 

14. _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of Delaware Law shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i). 

TENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend this Certificate of
Incorporation in any manner permitted by Delaware Law and all rights and
powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers, if any, are
subject to this reserved power.

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 2.01 _._ ___Time and Place of Meetings._ __ All meetings of
stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State
of Delaware, on such date and at such time as may be determined from time to
time by the Board of Directors (or the Chairman in the absence of a
designation by the Board of Directors).

 

Section 2.02 _._ ___Annual Meetings._ __ Unless directors are elected by
written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended ("Delaware Law"), an annual meeting of stockholders, commencing
with the year 2019, shall be held for the election of directors and to
transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting at
such date and time as may be designated by the Board from time to time.
Stockholders may, unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise
provides, act by written consent to elect directors; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such consent is less than unanimous, such action by written consent
may be in lieu of holding an annual meeting only if all of the directorships
to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at the
effective time of such action are vacant and are filled by such action.

 

Section 2.03 _._ ___Special Meetings._ __ Special meetings of stockholders may
be called by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board and shall be
called by the Secretary at the request in writing of holders of record of a
majority of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.
Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.

Section 2.04 _._ ___Notice of Meetings and Adjourned Meetings; Waivers of
Notice._ __ (a) _ _ Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take
any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which
shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise provided by Delaware Law, such notice shall be given not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. Unless these bylaws
otherwise require, when a meeting is adjourned to another time or

adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which

 stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than 30 days, or after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given
to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

(b) A written waiver of any such notice signed by the person entitled
thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to
notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends the meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall
be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

 

Section 2.05 _._ ___Quorum._ __ Unless otherwise provided under the
certificate of incorporation or these bylaws and subject to Delaware Law, the
presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If,
however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, a majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in
person or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting, without notice other
than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or
represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or
represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at
the meeting as originally notified.

Section 2.06 _._ ___Voting._ __ (a) __ Unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation and subject to Delaware Law, each stockholder
shall be entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of capital stock of
the Corporation held by such stockholder. Any share of capital stock of the
Corporation held by the Corporation shall have no voting rights. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws,
in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of
the majority of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.

 

(b) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to
express consent or dissent to a corporate action in writing without a meeting
may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy,
appointed by an instrument in writing, subscribed by such stockholder or by
his attorney thereunto authorized, or by proxy sent by cable, telegram or by
any means of electronic communication permitted by law, which results in a
writing from such stockholder or by his attorney, and delivered to the
secretary of the meeting. No proxy shall be voted after three years from
its date, unless said proxy provides for a longer period.

(c) In determining the number of votes cast for or against a proposal or
nominee, shares abstaining from voting on a matter will not be treated as a
vote cast.

Section 2.07 _._ _ _ _Action by Consent._ __ (a) __ Unless otherwise provided
in the certificate of incorporation and subject to the proviso in Section
2.02, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice
and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding capital stock
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of
business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book
in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made
to the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the
corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take
the action were delivered to the Corporation as provided in Section 2.07(b).

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(b) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of
each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be
effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60
days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required by this
section and Delaware Law to the Corporation, written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book
in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made
