AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 7, 2016 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, a New
York stock life insurance company (" _Parent_ "), TCT Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Owner_ " and,
together with Parent, the " _Parent Entities_ " and, each, a " _Parent
Entity_ "), Dolphin Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Owner (" _Merger Sub_ "), and EverBank Financial Corp, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub
and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic
business combination transactions provided for herein, pursuant to which
Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), so that the Company is the
surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as
the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger, and, immediately following the
Merger, Owner will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein
(including Section 6.11(b)), merge with and into the Surviving Corporation
(the " _Holdco Merger_ "), so that the Surviving Corporation is the surviving
corporation in the Holdco Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such
capacity also as the Surviving Corporation);

WHEREAS, immediately following the Holdco Merger (or, if Parent elects not to
consummate the Holdco Merger pursuant to Section 6.11(b), immediately
following the Merger), TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB (" _Parent Bank_ ") will,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Bank Merger
Agreement (as defined below), merge with and into EverBank (" _Company Bank_
") (the " _Bank Merger_ "), so that Company Bank is the surviving company in
the Bank Merger;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent is entering
into Voting and Support Agreements (each, a " _Voting and Support Agreement_
" and, collectively, the " _Voting and Support Agreements_ ") with certain
directors, executive officers and stockholders of the Company, in each case in
the form agreed to by the parties;

 

WHEREAS, prior to, or contemporaneously with, the execution of this Agreement,
Owner has entered into transaction bonus agreements with certain senior
officers of the Company (the " _Transaction Bonus Agreements_ "); and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 



-1- ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "
_DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company. The Company shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m.
New York City time at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, on a date
which shall be no later than five (5) business days after the satisfaction
or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the
conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless extended by mutual agreement of the
parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth
in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") on the Closing Date (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date
and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of
Merger.

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Company_ _Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parent
Entities, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any of the following
securities:

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.4, each share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), except for shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock, owned by any
Subsidiary of the Company or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent as a
General Account Share (as defined below) (in each case other than shares held
in managed accounts, separate accounts, mutual funds and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) and Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent
provided in Section 2.4), shall be converted into the right to receive $19.50
in cash without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As used herein,
the term " _General Account Share_ " means any share of stock that is owned by
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent and is treated as part of Parents general
account, but shall not include, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares held
in managed accounts, separate accounts, mutual funds and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted.

 



-2- (b) Subject to Section 2.4, each share of Series A 6.75% Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company Preferred Stock_ "), except for shares of Company Preferred Stock
owned by the Company as treasury stock, owned by any Subsidiary of the Company
or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent as a General Account Share (in
each case other than shares held in managed accounts, separate
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) and Dissenting
Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section 2.4), shall be
converted into the right to receive $25,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends
on a share of Company Preferred Stock since the last dividend payment date for
the Company Preferred Stock to but excluding the Closing Date less any
dividends declared but unpaid, if any, through the Effective Time, in cash
without interest (the " _Preferred Stock Consideration_ ") (for the avoidance
of doubt, the intention of this provision is that the holders of the Company
Preferred Stock will receive dividends and a payment pursuant to this Section
1.5(b) that will make them whole with respect to dividends through the day
before the Closing without duplication).

 

(c) All of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock (together, the " _Company Stock_ ") converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration pursuant to this
Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled

herein to " _Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include as applicable (and as
reasonably interpreted by Parent) reference to book-entry account arrangements
for the ownership of shares of Company Stock) previously representing any such
shares of Company Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable.
Certificates previously representing shares of Company Stock shall be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration,
as applicable, upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, merger or other similar change in capitalization (not
including, for the avoidance of doubt, for any such change in the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as a result of exercises of Company
Stock Options or the settlement of Company Equity Awards, in each case, in
accordance with their terms), the Merger Consideration and the Preferred
Stock Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change;
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 1.5(c) shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. No interest shall be paid on
the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock that are owned by the Company
as treasury stock, owned by any Subsidiary of the Company or owned by Parent
or any Subsidiary of

 



-3-  Parent as a General Account Share (in each case other than shares held in

contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Amended and Restated

(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
" _Company Stock Option_ ") shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall entitle the
holder of such Company Stock Option to receive (without interest), as soon as

subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over
(B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock
Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option which has an
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal
to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, (A) any vesting conditions applicable to

Company PBRSU shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall entitle the holder of such
Company PBRSU to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than five (5)
business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PBRSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time based on target performance as of the
Effective Time as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ")
pursuant to the terms of such award _multiplied by_ (y) the Merger
Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment; _provided_ , that, with respect to any Company PBRSUs
that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to section 409A of
the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without
triggering a Tax or penalty under section 409A of the Code, such payment shall
be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Stock
Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under section
409A of the Code.

Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall

Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT OF COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS

2.1 _Parent to Make Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock
Consideration Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance
with this Article II, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and the aggregate Preferred Stock Consideration (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Stock.

 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock
Consideration_.

 



-6- (a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than five (5) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates
representing shares of Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable,
pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock
Consideration, as applicable. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a check representing the amount of the Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, and the Certificate
or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable to holders of Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, and subject to Section 2.4,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration
or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable.

 

(b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate
representing Company Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of the Company, the proper amount of cash shall be paid to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Stock shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the
Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, to
be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures in this
Article II.

 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, without any
interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Certificate or Certificates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



-7- (e) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration, the
Preferred Stock Consideration or any other consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock, as
applicable, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Stock
in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine
is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Payment of Company Equity Awards_. Parent shall take all
actions necessary so that, no later than five (5) business days after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to
each holder of a Company Equity Award the amounts to which such holder is
entitled as determined in accordance with Sections 1.9(a), 1.9(b) and 1.9(c)
through the Surviving Corporations or applicable Company Subsidiarys payroll
system, to the extent permitted thereby. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation has insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of
Company Equity Awards, Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the
Surviving Corporation sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

 

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under applicable Law with
respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, but
instead shall be entitled to payment of such consideration as may be
determined to be due in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in
accordance with Section 1.5 upon surrender of such shares of Company Stock.

 



-8- (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal, of any withdrawals of such demands and
of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to any such appraisal
demands.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of
this Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this
Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced therein and (2) other
sections of this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its
face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from reading
only the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or
(b) as disclosed in any Company Reports filed by the Company after January 1,
2015 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding any exhibits to any filed
Company Reports or risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to each of the Parent Entities as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a savings and
loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933
(the " _HOLA_ ") and is duly registered with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ "). The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company
is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and

 



-9-  its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole ( _provided_ , that, with respect to this
clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact
of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B)
changes, after the date hereof, in Laws of general applicability to companies
in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
(including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest
rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D)
public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on
a partys relationships with its customers or employees) or actions expressly
required by this Agreement (excluding the obligations with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries operating in the ordinary course of business) in
contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ that, for purposes of Section 3.3(b) and Section 7.2(a) (to the
extent relating to Section 3.3(b)), the exceptions set forth in this clause
(D) shall not apply in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred), (E) a decline, in and of itself, in the trading price of the
Companys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections or internal financial forecasts ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that
the underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred) or (F) the
reasonable and customary expenses incurred by the Company or the Parent
Entities in negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; except, with respect to
subclause (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change are
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate), or (ii) the
ability of such party or any Subsidiary of such party to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Section 10(a)(1)(G) of
HOLA. True and complete copies of the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ ") and the amended
and restated bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by the
Company to Parent, and the Company is not in violation of its organizational
or governing documents, including the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Company Subsidiary to pay
dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Company Subsidiary that is
a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated 

 



-10-  entities. The deposit accounts of Company Bank are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance
Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments
required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no
proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened.
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of (x) all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof and
(y) all persons (not including the Company Subsidiaries) in which the Company,
together with any Company Subsidiaries, owns (directly or indirectly) 5% or
more of a class of voting securities.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 500,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of Company Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, there are (i)
125,325,210 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding (which, for

of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the settlement of

goals at the target level) and (vii) no other shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. All the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
that have the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of the
Company may vote. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary are issued or outstanding. Other than the
Company Equity Awards, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible
securities or other commitments or agreements obligating the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, any such securities. There are no voting trusts, stockholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to the voting
or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the
Company. Each grant of a Company Equity Award was duly authorized no later
than the grant date of such award by all necessary corporate action,
including, as applicable, approval by the Board of Directors of the Company
(or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required
stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes. Each such grant was
made under a Company Stock Plan and in all material respects in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and
all other applicable Laws, including the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange. Each grant of a Company Equity Award was properly accounted for in
accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes)
of the Company and disclosed in the Company Reports in accordance with the
Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws. No Company Subsidiary owns any
shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares held in managed accounts,
separate accounts, 

 



-11-  mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted).

 

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with
no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of any Company Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of any Company Subsidiary.

 

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as
of the date hereof, a true, correct and complete list of all Company Stock
Options, Company RSUs and Company PBRSUs outstanding as of the date hereof
specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder, (ii) the
number of shares subject to each such Company Equity Award (assuming
achievement of any applicable performance goals at the target and maximum
levels, respectively), (iii) the grant date of each such Company Equity Award,
(iv) the vesting schedule for each such Company Equity Award and (v) the
exercise price for each such Company Stock Option.

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to the stockholder and other actions
described below, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly, validly and
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of
Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger, on

this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, nor the consummation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the

lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause

not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

necessary regulatory approvals and 

 



-13-  consents will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger,
the Bank Merger and the Holdco Merger on a timely basis and without the
imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.4 are

required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the Laws of
the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or
statement or to pay such fees and assessments would not reasonably be expected
to be, either individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of their respective dates (and without
giving effect to any amendments or modifications filed after the date of this
Agreement with respect to reports and documents filed before the date of this
Agreement), each of such reports and documents, including the
financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied in all
material respects with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or
promulgated by the Regulatory Agency with which they were filed. Except as set

examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory Agency has
initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, investigation into the business or operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013, (ii) there is no
unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections

statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed
with or furnished to the SEC by the Company since January 1, 2013 pursuant to
the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") or the Exchange Act
(the " _Company Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Company Report, as
of the date thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements,

 



-14-  on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all Company
Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto. No executive officer of the Company has
failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ ") since January 1, 2013. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the Company Reports.

 

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries

(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated

immaterial in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates
of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case,
as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Deloitte and Touche LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company
that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants
of the Company as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with
the Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any
nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities (i) that are
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended
June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 (including any notes thereto), (ii) incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June
30, 2016, (iii) incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) arising under any contract or
agreement set forth in Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
except to the extent arising from the Companys or its applicable Subsidiarys
breach of any such contract or agreement or

 



-15-  (v) disclosed pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of the first paragraph of this
Article III. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
material "off-balance sheet arrangements" as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information relating
to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by others
within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board
of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures, if any, were made in writing by management to
the Companys auditor and audit committee and a copy of any such disclosure
has been made available to Parent. There is no reason to believe that the
Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of the Company, to any
director or officer of the Company.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made available to

with respect to the engagement by the Company of UBS Securities LLC related to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Sections 3.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (in the case of Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, solely to the extent the applicable action occurs
following the date hereof) and in connection with matters related to this
Agreement and the Companys review of its strategic alternatives (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall not include entering into an agreement or
transaction for an Acquisition Proposal), since December 31, 2015, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business, and from such date until
the date hereof, there has not been any action taken or committed to be taken
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if taken following entry by
the Company into this Agreement, would have required the consent of Parent

5.2(m), 5.2(p), 5.2(q) or 5.2(r).

executive officers or challenging the validity or propriety of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
material Company Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company

any current or former employee, consultant, officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and with respect to which any ongoing obligation
exists or any potential liability is borne by the Company or any of its

amendments thereto, and (ii) to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent
summary plan description, if any, required under ERISA with respect to such

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under section
401(a) of the Code (the " _Company Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter with respect to each Company Qualified Plan
and the related trust, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Qualified
Plan or the related trust. 

(e) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has contributed (or had any obligation to
contribute) in the last six (6) years to an employee benefit plan that is

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA

(g) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan
by applicable Law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable

period through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to
the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the books and records of the Company, except as,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) There are no, and since January 1, 2013 there have not been any,
pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary
course), lawsuits, investigations, audits (other than routine audits by a
Governmental Entity), proceedings or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists
that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim, lawsuit,
investigation, audit (other than a routine audit by a Governmental Entity),
proceeding or arbitration against the Company Benefit Plans, or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, except
as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or
set aside any assets to fund any material benefits under any Company Benefit
Plan, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other
benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any plan, program, agreement or arrangement that provides for
the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes imposed under

Law relating to Tax). The Company has made available to Parent preliminary
Section 280G calculations (the " _Preliminary 280G Calculations_ ") which,
based on the assumptions set forth therein, are true and correct as of the
date hereof.

forms part of a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code has been timely amended (if applicable) to comply
and has been operated in compliance with, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
have complied in practice and operation with, all applicable requirements of
Section 409A of the Code in all material respects.

 

(k) The Company maintains a policy that restricts the grant of Company
Equity Awards immediately prior to, or otherwise in coordination with, the
release or other public announcement of material information regarding the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their financial results
or prospects and, to the knowledge of the Company, the Company has complied
in practice and operation with such policy in all material respects.

 

(l) There are no and since January 1, 2013, there have not been any
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened material labor
grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against the

nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by or since January 1, 2013

civil rights, affirmative action, work authorization, immigration, safety and
health, information privacy and security, works compensation, continuation
coverage under group health plans, wage payment and the payment of
withholding of taxes, except for failures to comply that have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. No employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside of the United
States.

 

(n) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or making a change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan that would materially increase the
expense of maintaining such plan above the level of expense incurred in
respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, except as
required in order to comply with applicable Law.

authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
and ownership of their respective properties, rights and assets under and
pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor
the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or
authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit
or authorization is threatened.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no later
than thirty-five (35) days after the date of this Agreement, the Proxy
Statement, and each of the Parent Entities shall cooperate with the Company in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable after such filing and shall thereafter as promptly as
practicable (but in any event no later than ten (10) days thereafter) mail or
deliver the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any oral or
written comments from the staff of the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall cooperate and provide Parent with the opportunity to review
and comment on (i) the draft of the Proxy Statement (including each amendment
or supplement thereto) and (ii) all written responses to requests for
additional information by and replies to written comments of the staff of the
SEC, prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement with or sending such to the
SEC, and the Company will (x) consider Parents comments in good faith, (y)
not make any statement therein regarding Parent or any of its affiliates
without Parents consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), except as may be
required by applicable Law and (z) provide to Parent copies of all such

 



-43-  filings made and correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect
thereto. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should be
discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to
its stockholders.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger, the Bank Merger and the Holdco Merger), and
to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental
Entities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as
practicable and in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the date of
this Agreement, each of the Parent Entities and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, prepare and file any applications,
notices and filings required to be filed with any regulatory agency in order
to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding that Company Bank is required to file an application under the
Bank Merger Act, each of the Parent Entities shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, prepare such application and be responsible for
the approval process relating thereto. In connection with the foregoing, any
filing party shall request confidential treatment for any information another
party shall request be kept confidential, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such request to
be granted. Subject to Section 6.1(c), each of the Parent Entities and the
Company shall use, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to
use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory
Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of the Parent Entities
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and each party will keep the other parties apprised promptly
of the status of filings and applications, including communications with
Governmental Entities, and all other matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall consult with the other
parties in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Parent 

 



-44-  Entities and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing; _provided_ that
none of the Parent Entities shall have any obligation to litigate or
participate in the litigation of any action, suit or proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, in order to oppose or defend any action, suit or
proceeding by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the FDIC, the NYDFS, the SEC
or FINRA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require any of the Parent Entities or permit the
Company to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction that would (i) reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (but measured on a scale relative to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole as of the date hereof), (ii) cause Parent to
lose, suffer any diminution in or have otherwise adversely modified or
impaired any of its legislative or regulatory rights, statuses or privileges
or have an adverse effect on the regulatory exemptions available to Parent
due to any of the foregoing or (iii) cause Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Parent Bank, Company Bank and their respective Subsidiaries) to
either (x) divest, restrict or be subject to any limit on any lawful business
or activity (other than, in the case of this clause (iii), either (A) the
closure of offices, or similar requirements, resulting from competition issues
or (B) regulatory conditions that would be _de minimis_ ) or (y) be subject
to any prior notice or approval rights with respect to the ability to engage
in any lawful business or activity (each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(d) Each of the Parent Entities and the Company shall, upon request,
furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger, the Holdco
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parent
Entities and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, "
_Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals from the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and, if
required, the FDIC.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the
Parent Entities, for the

 



-45-  purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the Company,
preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement,
or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated herein, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information
technology systems and records, and the Company shall cooperate with the
Parent Entities in preparing to execute after the Effective Time the
conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
make available to the Parent Entities (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal securities Laws or federal or state banking Laws (other than reports
or documents that the Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable
Law), and (ii) all other information concerning the Companys and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the Parent Entities may
reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution
in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration
to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company will
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Parent shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to
Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated May 7, 2016,
between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and
Owner shall hold all such information in confidence to the extent required by,
and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if
it were a party thereto.

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either the Company or
any of the Parent Entities, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.3 _Stockholders  Approval_.

 

(a) The Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special

 



-46-  meeting of stockholders to adopt a merger agreement. The Board of Directors
of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
stockholders of the Company the Requisite Company Vote, including by
communicating to its stockholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "). The Company shall if requested by Parent engage
a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in the
solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the Requisite Company
Vote. However, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Board of Directors of
the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement,
then in submitting this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company, the
Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to the
stockholders of the Company without recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent
required by Law; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may
not take any actions under this sentence unless (A) (1) the Company has
received an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
6.9 (and such proposal is not withdrawn) and the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below)
or (2) an Intervening Event shall have occurred and the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor)
that continuing to recommend this Agreement would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the
Company gives Parent at least five (5) business days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including
(1) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal and any amendment or modification thereof or (2) in the
case of an Intervening Event, the nature of the Intervening Event in
reasonable detail) and (C) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of the Company takes into account any amendment or modification to
this Agreement proposed by Parent (which shall be negotiated in good faith by
the Company) and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good
faith that it would nevertheless be more likely than not to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to
recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section
6.3(a) and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section
6.3(a). The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if, as of
the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of

 



-47-  shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. For the avoidance of
doubt, but subject to the immediately preceding sentence, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose of voting
on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby
as provided for in this Agreement and nothing herein shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of such obligation. Except as set forth in this Section
6.3(a), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw, change,
qualify or modify or publicly and affirmatively propose to withdraw, change,
qualify or modify the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for Company Common Stock
within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such offer or (iii)
approve, resolve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, resolve,
adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses
(i) through (iii) being referred to as a " _Change in Company Recommendation_
").

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Intervening Event_ " means
any event, change, effect, development or occurrence occurring or arising
after the date of this Agreement that (i) was not known, or reasonably
foreseeable, to the Board of Directors of the Company as of or prior to the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Agreement by
the Company and (ii) does not relate to or involve an Acquisition Proposal.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section
6.1 of this Agreement, each of the Parent Entities and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best
efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that
may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger,
the Bank Merger and the Holdco Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth
in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by the Company or any of the Parent Entities or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger, the
Holdco Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on (i)
if the Closing Date occurs on or prior to March 31 of any calendar year,
December 31 of such calendar year or (ii) if the Closing Date occurs after
March 31 of any calendar year, the first anniversary of the Closing Date (such
period, the " _Maintenance Period_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the
Effective Time for so long as such employee is employed following the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base
salary, base wage rate or commission schedule, as applicable, that is no less
favorable than the base salary, base wage rate or commission schedule, as
applicable, provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing
Employee immediately 

 



-48-  prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term cash incentive opportunities
that are substantially comparable to the short-term cash incentive
opportunities provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) a target
long-term incentive opportunity that is substantially comparable to the target
long-term incentive opportunity provided by the Company or any
such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that such long-term incentive opportunity may be
provided in the form of unrestricted or deferred cash, or a phantom or
notional equity-based incentive program, in the sole discretion of Parent,
(iv) vacation, personal and sick day entitlements that are no less favorable
than the vacation, personal and sick day entitlements provided by the Company
or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (v) retirement and other employee benefits (excluding
equity and other long term incentive benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those retirement and other employee
benefits provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing
Employee whose employment terminates during the Maintenance Period with
severance benefits pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Benefit Plan set forth in Section 6.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions, evidence of insurability (other than with respect to life
insurance, _provided_ that Parent will cause the applicable New Plan to
provide Continuing Employees with guaranteed issue amounts thereunder), and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods would apply under the most closely analogous Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each such
employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time under a
Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
most closely analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans, (iii) assume all obligations to provide
continued health coverage in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code and
Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA to the qualified beneficiaries
of Continuing Employees and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to
recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries
for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was
taken into account under the most closely analogous Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing service
recognition shall not apply (x) to the extent it would result in duplication
of benefits for the same period of services, (y) for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension or the employer premium subsidy
under any retiree medical plan, or (z) to any benefit plan that is a frozen
plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee population.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume
and

 



-49-  honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms; _provided_
that nothing in this Section 6.5(c) is intended to prevent Parent from
amending or terminating Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms.
Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective
Time.

 

(d) The Company shall be permitted to finally and conclusively
determine, in good faith, the amounts earned under the Bonus Plans in respect
of the 2016 fiscal year (such amounts, the " _2016 Bonuses_ ") based on
funding at actual performance with respect to applicable financial and non-
financial performance metrics;  _provided_ , however, that solely with
respect to those Bonus Plans listed on Section 6.5(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, any component of the financial performance metrics that
is measured based on return on equity shall be deemed to have been achieved
at the greater of actual or target performance. 2016 Bonuses shall be paid in
the ordinary course of business at such time when annual bonuses have
historically been paid out by the Company (the " _2016 Bonus Payment Date_
"). To the extent that the Closing Date occurs on or before the 2016 Bonus
Payment Date, (i) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay out 2016 Bonuses on (or promptly following) the 2016 Bonus Payment Date
and (ii) without limiting any other provision of any Company Plan, if (x) the
Closing Date occurs after December 31, 2016 and (y) an employees employment
is terminated by the Surviving Corporation without cause after the Closing
Date but prior to the 2016 Bonus Payment Date, then (z) notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in any such Company Plan, such employee shall be
entitled to receive payment of his or her 2016 Bonus upon the 2016 Bonus
Payment Date ( _provided_ that any such payment shall not be duplicative of
any other similar right to payment of the 2016 Bonus or a pro-rata portion
thereof under any other Company Plan). If the Closing Date occurs on or after
January 1, 2017, upon notice to and in consultation with Parent, the Company
shall be permitted to establish annual bonus targets, maximums and performance
award levels, performance measures and eligibility and participation
requirements for the 2017 fiscal year under the Bonus Plans, in the
ordinary course of business consistent with business strategy objectives.

(e) Parent and the Company shall each, and shall cause each of their
respective affiliates to, comply with all Laws regarding the maintenance, use,
sharing and processing of Employee Personal Data, including (i) compliance
with any applicable legal requirements to provide notice to, or obtain
consent from, the employee for processing of the data and (ii) taking any
other steps necessary to ensure compliance with applicable data protection
Laws. " _Employee Personal Data_ " means any information relating to the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that (i) is obtained by
Parent or its affiliates from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives or (ii) is created by Parent or its affiliates based on such
information.

(f) Unless otherwise requested by Parent not later than ten (10)
business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions,
including through resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors (or a duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof or other appropriate governing
body) that may be necessary or appropriate to cause the EverBank Profit
Sharing and Savings Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2014
(the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), to terminate effective on the business day 

 



-50-  immediately preceding the Closing Date, with such termination being
contingent on the Closing. Such resolutions shall be subject to Parents
reasonable prior review and approval.

 

(g) If Parent or any of its affiliates maintains a defined contribution
plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") and
Parent elects to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan pursuant to Section 6.5(f),
Parent shall permit each Continuing Employee participating in the Company
401(k) Plan to elect, and Parent agrees to cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to
accept, in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of the Parent 401(k)
Plan a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) of his or her account balances (including earnings thereon through the
date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) under
the Company 401(k) Plan. Each Continuing Employee shall become a participant
in the Parent 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date (giving effect to the service
crediting provisions of Section 6.5(b)); it being agreed that no Continuing
Employee shall experience a gap in eligibility to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) Prior to making any written broad-based communications to the
employees of the Company of its Subsidiaries with respect to employment,
compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related,
directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(excluding any communications relating to ordinary course employment,
compensation or benefits matters unrelated thereto), the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication and the
Company shall consider Parents comments in good faith.

(i) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit
Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever (including the creation of any third-party beneficiary rights)
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



-51- (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each present and former director or officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the
" _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Company
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Company
Indemnified Party, and the Company Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the Parent and the Surviving Corporation, in the
defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and
former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
(including the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement); _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the
current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, the Company, with the prior consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld), may (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time
a six (6)-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policy providing coverage equivalent to the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company as of the date hereof if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium
Cap. If the Company purchases such a "tail policy," Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect and continue to
honor its obligations thereunder.

 



-52- (c) Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 6.6, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation described above, will promptly notify the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , that failure to so notify will not affect the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.6 unless and to
the extent that the Surviving Corporation is actually prejudiced as a
consequence.

 

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company
under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified after the
Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified
Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.6 without
the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party or
affected person.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or liabilities to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6 are not otherwise transferred and assumed by such successors and
assigns by operation of law or otherwise, the Surviving Corporation will cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6.

 

6.7 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of a Parent
Entity, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

6.8 _Advice of Changes_. Each of the Parent Entities, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand (in such capacity, the " _Notifying
Party_ "), shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of the
Notifying Partys representations, warranties or covenants contained herein
that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in, if a Parent Entity is
the Notifying Party, Section 7.1 or 7.3, or if the Company is the Notifying
Party, Section 7.1 or 7.2; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this Section 6.8 or the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

 



-53- 6.9 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to
any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a person that makes any inquiry
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of
this Section 6.9(a); _provided_ , that, prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company by the Requisite Company Vote, in
the event the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement (which Acquisition Proposal did
not result from a breach of this Section 6.9) and its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to
the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions would be
more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, (x) the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (y)
any non-public information to be provided to such third party shall have been
previously provided to Parent. The Company will, and will cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than any of the Parent Entities with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and the Company shall promptly request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to
any such other person. The Company will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the
terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any existing confidentiality, standstill or similar agreements to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms
thereof. The Company shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to on
its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.9(a)) relating
to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any offer or proposal relating to any

 



-54-  third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated
assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer)
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the
Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company or one or more of its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company.

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a
_bona fide_ unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (substituting "50%" for
"20%" in the definition thereof) which the Board of Directors has determined
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial
advisors, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such offer or proposal and the person making the proposal,
that, (i) if consummated, would be more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock, from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any proposed
revisions to the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) is more likely than not to
be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to the Companys
stockholders;  _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or
modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have
under this Agreement.

 

6.10 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan and, except as required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to
the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.11 _Change of Method_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the Merger
(including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_ , that no
such change that requires any approval of the holders of the Company Common
Stock shall be made without (or without being subject to) such approval. The
parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.2.

 



-55- (b) Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
to (i) change the structure of effecting the Bank Merger so that Parent Bank
would be the surviving entity and/or the Holdco Merger so that Owner would be
the surviving entity or (ii) elect not to consummate the Holdco Merger, in
each case so long as no such change would reasonably be expected to (x)
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (y) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
the Companys stockholders pursuant to this Agreement. If Parent elects not
to consummate the Holdco Merger, references in this Agreement to the Holdco
Merger shall be disregarded. For purposes of the representations and
warranties in Article III, it shall be assumed that Owner is the surviving
entity in the Holdco Merger and Parent Bank is the surviving entity in the
Bank Merger. For purposes of the representations and warranties in Article IV,
it shall be assumed that the Surviving Corporation is the surviving entity in
the Holdco Merger and Company Bank is the surviving entity in the Bank Merger.

 

6.12 _Restructuring Efforts_. Without limiting Section 8.1(e), if the
Company shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the duly
convened Company Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of
the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a
restructuring of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _it_
_being_ _understood_ that none of the parties shall have any obligation to
alter or change any material terms, including the Merger Consideration, the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital
stock or equity rights of the Company as provided for in this Agreement, in a
manner adverse to such party or the Companys stockholders) and/or resubmit
this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as
restructured pursuant to this Section 6.12) for adoption or approval, as
applicable, by its stockholders.

 

6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, the Parent Entities or
their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause
any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all
necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover
Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.14 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.15 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions,

 



-56-  and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New
York Stock Exchange to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the Company Stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the deregistration of
the Company Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

 

6.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall cooperate and consult
with the Parent Entities in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors or affiliates relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall afford the Parent
Entities the opportunity to participate at their own expense in the defense
or settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be offered
or agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. In furtherance of and without in any way limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts (without
unreasonable expense) to prevail or settle on terms reasonably satisfactory to
Parent in any such litigation so as to permit the consummation of the Merger
in the manner contemplated by this Agreement.

6.17 _Transition_. Commencing following the date hereof, and in all
cases subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the
integration of the parties and their respective businesses effective as of
the Closing Date or such later date as may be determined by Parent. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date and consistent with the performance of their day-to-day
operations and the continuous operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the ordinary course of business, the Company shall cause the employees,
officers and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to provide support, including support from
its outside contractors and vendors, as well as data and records access, and
take actions and assist Parent in performing all tasks, including conversion
planning, assisting in any post-closing divestiture, post-closing equipment
installation, training, the provision of customer communications and notices
(including joint communications and notices relating to anticipated account
changes, branch closures, divestiture and/or systems conversion), and other
matters reasonably required to result in a successful transition and
integration at the Closing or such later date as may be determined by Parent.
Nothing contained in this Section 6.17 shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, any right to control or direct the operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

6.18 _Employee Cooperation_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
assist Parent in identifying key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(such employees as are so identified by Parent, " _Key Employees_ "),
including providing any information as reasonably requested by Parent about
individual employees and groups of employees with respect to their roles, job
descriptions, performance, compensation levels, retention risk factors and
other similar information and (b) to the extent requested by Parent, cooperate
in good faith with Parent to help establish and implement, on behalf of
Parent, any employee retention and transition incentive programs designed to
encourage the retention and performance of Key Employees and (c) ensure that
no executive officer of, or written communication by, the Company or its
Subsidiaries disparages Parent or any of its affiliates in any way or
interferes with Parents retention efforts

 



-57-  with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

6.19 _Certain Indebtedness_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the receipt of any written request by Parent to do so, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to commence an offer to purchase related to any or
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount and all other amounts due in
respect of any notes (the " _Notes_ ") of the Company issued pursuant to the
Indenture, dated as of June 30, 2015, by and between the Company and Wells
Fargo, N.A., as Trustee (as amended, modified or supplemented, the "
_Indenture_ "), on such terms and conditions, including pricing terms, that
are specified and requested, from time to time, by Parent (the " _Debt Tender
Offer_ "), and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith;
_provided_ that (x) Parent shall only request the Company to conduct a Debt
Tender Offer in compliance with the Indenture and the rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and (y) the Company
shall not be required to take any action in connection with a Debt Tender
Offer if such action would violate applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the closing of any Debt Tender Offer shall be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing and obtaining any required regulatory approvals
with respect to such Debt Tender Offer, and the parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause any such Debt Tender Offer to
close on the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.
Subject to the preceding sentence, the Company shall provide, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with any Debt Tender Offer, including
preparing the offer to purchase and letter of transmittal and engaging a
dealer manager and information agent selected by Parent in connection with any
such Debt Tender Offer. The Company (i) shall waive any of the conditions to
any Debt Tender Offer (other than the occurrence of the Closing) and make any
change to any Debt Tender Offer, in each case, as may be reasonably requested
by Parent and (ii) shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive
any condition to any Debt Tender Offer or make any changes to any Debt Tender
Offer. Parent shall ensure that at the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation has all funds necessary to pay for such notes that have been
properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to any Debt Tender Offer
commenced pursuant to this Section 6.19. Parent shall reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in connection
with its compliance with this Section 6.19. For the avoidance of doubt, the
failure of any Debt Tender Offer shall not affect the obligations of the
Parent Entities and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company:

 

(a) by the mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written
instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board;

 



-60- (b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that
must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger,
the Bank Merger or the Holdco Merger and such denial has become final and
nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger
or the Holdco Merger; _provided_ that if the failure to obtain a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein, such party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b);

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the fifteenth (15th) month anniversary of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that if the failure of
the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein such party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c);

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any
of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties
(or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in
this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or any Parent Entity or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by
the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring
or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in the
case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within thirty
(30) days (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date)
following written notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by its
nature or timing cannot be cured during such period;

(e) by either Parent or the Company if the Company Meeting
(including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded
and the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained;

 

(f) by Parent prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (A) failed
to recommend in the Proxy Statement that the stockholders of the Company adopt
this Agreement, (B) effected a Change in Company Recommendation, (C) failed to
issue a press release announcing its opposition to an Acquisition Proposal
within ten (10) business days after such Acquisition Proposal is publicly
announced or (D) submitted this Agreement to the holders of Company Common
Stock for approval without a recommendation for approval or (ii) the Company
or its Board of Directors has breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or
6.9 in any material respect;

 

(g) by Parent, if the Federal Reserve Board or the OCC has granted a 

 



-61-  Requisite Regulatory Approval but such Requisite Regulatory Approval
contains or would result in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition and there is no meaningful possibility that such
Requisite Regulatory Approval could be revised prior to the Termination Date
so as not to contain or result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition; _provided_ that if (i) Parent does not elect to terminate
this Agreement within 60 days following any such termination right arising
under this Section 8.1(g) and (ii) Parent has not by the end of such 60 day
period waived the Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition with respect to
which such termination right arose, then the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g); _provided_ , _further_ , that, if
during the 60 day period referred to in the preceding proviso any new material
condition or restriction is imposed by a Governmental Entity (regardless of
whether such new condition or restriction would itself constitute a Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition) such 60 day period shall be extended until 60
days after such new condition or restriction was imposed with there being no
meaningful possibility that such new condition or restriction would be revised
prior to the Termination Date so as not to be a material condition or
restriction; or

 

(h) by either Parent or the Company if the Federal Reserve Board or the
OCC shall have requested in writing that the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates withdraw (other than for technical reasons), and not be
permitted to resubmit within 60 days, any application with respect to a
Requisite Regulatory Approval.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or
the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of the Parent Entities, the Company, any of
their respective affiliates or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b),
this Section 8.2 and Article IX ( _provided_ that in such event Section 9.12
shall, for the avoidance of doubt, survive only with respect to the other
surviving provisions) shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of
the Parent Entities, Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or its willful and
material breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of the
Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Stock of
the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium
offered to the holders of Company Common Stock, _it_ _being_ _understood_ that
the Company shall be entitled to pursue damages for such losses and to enforce
the right to recover such losses on behalf of its stockholders in its sole
and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by the Company in connection
therewith may be retained by the Company).

 

(b) In the event that:

 



-62- (i) (x) prior to the Effective Time and after the date hereof, any
person shall have made an Acquisition Proposal, which proposal has been
publicly disclosed or made known to management of Company or its stockholders
generally, or any person shall have publicly announced or made known to
management of Company an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal, (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
party pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Company Vote having
been obtained or Section 8.1(e) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and
(z) within twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above); _provided_ that, for purposes of this
Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to
"20%" shall instead refer to "50%"; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

then the Company shall pay Parent a fee, in immediately available funds, in
the amount of $93,200,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") upon, in the case of
Section 8.2(b)(i), the earlier of the date it enters into the applicable
definitive agreement and the date of the consummation of such transaction, and
in the case of Section 8.2(b)(ii), as promptly as practicable after (and in
any event within two (2) business days of) the termination of this Agreement.
In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay Parent the Termination Fee
on more than one occasion.

 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parent Entities would
not enter into this Agreement. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and, except in
the case of fraud or a willful and knowing breach, shall be the sole monetary
remedy in a circumstance where the Termination Fee is payable and is paid in
full. In the event that the Company fails to pay when due any amounts payable
under Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall (i) reimburse Parent for all
costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel)
incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and (ii)
pay Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of
the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at
a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made.

warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of the risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its

entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the
parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of
a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [●],
2016, is made by and between TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB, a federal savings
association (" _Parent Bank_ "), and EverBank, a federal savings association
(" _Company Bank_ ").

 

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, Parent Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of TCT Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Owner_ "), is a chartered federal savings
association;

 

WHEREAS, Company Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of EverBank Financial Corp, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), is a chartered federal savings
association;

WHEREAS, Owner, the Company, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of
America, a New York stock life insurance company (" _Parent_ "), and Dolphin
Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Owner
(" _Merger Sub_ "), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of August 7, 2016 (as amended from time to time, the " _Parent Merger
Agreement_ "), which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, provides
for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Parent Merger_
"), with the Company as the surviving company in the Parent Merger;

WHEREAS, contingent upon the Parent Merger and, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Parent Merger Agreement (including Section
6.11(b) thereof), immediately following the time at which the Parent Merger
becomes effective, Owner will merge with and into the Company (the " _Holdco
Merger_ "), with the Company as the surviving company in the Holdco Merger;

WHEREAS, contingent upon the Parent Merger and immediately following the time
at which the Holdco Merger becomes effective (or, in the event that Parent
elects not to consummate the Holdco Merger pursuant to Section 6.11(b) of the
Parent Merger Agreement, immediately following the time at which the Parent
Merger becomes effective), on the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement intend to effect
the merger of Parent Bank with and into Company Bank, with Company Bank
surviving the merger (the " _Bank Merger_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent Bank and Company Bank have each
determined that the Bank Merger is desirable and in the best interests of
their respective banks, and have unanimously authorized and approved the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements
herein contained, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:  ARTICLE I

 

BANK MERGER

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined below), Parent Bank shall be
merged with and into Company Bank in accordance with the provisions of
12 U.S.C. §§ 1828(c) and 1467a(s), and the regulations of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (" _OCC_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate
existence of Parent Bank shall cease, and Company Bank, as the
surviving entity (the " _Surviving Bank_ "), shall continue unaffected and
unimpaired by the Bank Merger. All rights, franchises, and interests of Parent
Bank in and to every type of property (real, personal, and mixed) and choses
in action shall be vested in the Surviving Bank by virtue of such merger
without any deed or other transfer. The Surviving Bank, upon the consummation
of the Bank Merger and without any order or other action on the part of any
court or otherwise, shall hold and enjoy all rights of property, franchises,
and interests, including appointments, designations, and nominations, and all
other rights and interests as trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of
stocks and bonds, guardian of estates, assignee, and receiver, and in every
other fiduciary capacity, in the same manner and to the same extent as such
rights, franchises, and interests were held or enjoyed by Parent Bank or
Company Bank at the time of Bank Merger. The Surviving Bank shall
be responsible for all of the liabilities of every kind and description,
including liabilities arising from the operation of any trust department, of
each of the merging banks existing as of the Effective Time. Immediately
following the Effective Time, the main office and any branches of the Parent
Bank existing as of the Effective Time shall become branches of the Surviving
Bank, although the main office of the Parent Bank shall be operated by the
Surviving Bank as a non-depository trust office. 

Section 1.02 _Effective Time_. Subject to applicable law, the Bank Merger
shall become effective at the date and time specified in the Certificate of
Merger to be issued by the OCC. The date and time so specified shall be
immediately following the effective time of the Holdco Merger (or, in the
event that Parent elects not to consummate the Holdco Merger pursuant to
Section 6.11(b) of the Parent Merger Agreement, immediately following the time
at which the Parent Merger becomes effective) when all of the conditions
precedent to the consummation of the Bank Merger specified in this Agreement
shall have been satisfied or duly waived by the party entitled to satisfaction
thereof (such date and time of the Bank Merger being herein referred to as the
" _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.03 _Charter and Bylaws_. The charter and bylaws of Company Bank
