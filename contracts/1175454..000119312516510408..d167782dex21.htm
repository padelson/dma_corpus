(1/3) of the statutory term available for the submission of a defense
or legal answer to the Third Party Lawsuit. The failure by the Indemnitee to

entitled to, by means of a notice in writing to the Indemnitee prior to the
expiration of the second one third (1/3) of the statutory term available for
the submission of a defense, undertake the defense of the Third Party Lawsuit,
at its exclusive costs and expenses. In the event that the Indemnifying Party

or compromise the Third Party Lawsuit, confess, waive rights or otherwise
undertake any obligation in the name of the Indemnitee without such
Indemnitees prior written authorization, which shall not be unreasonably

the Indemnitee a previous notice regarding the settlement, agreement,
confession or waiver of right, and the Indemnitee shall answer, in writing,
regarding the content of the notice in a reasonable term, as it is requested
in such notice, being that the absence of an answer shall be considered a
tacit approval of the Indemnitee for the settlement, agreement, confession or
waiver of right proposed. For purposes of item (iii) above and of this item
(iv), the Parties acknowledge that a decision of the Indemnitee in denying
authorization to the Indemnifying Party to settle, enter into an agreement,
confession, or waive a right, shall be considered justified if the settlement,
agreement, confession or waiver of right (1) does not include or imply in,
full and unconditional release of the Indemnitee of any and all responsibility
arising from the Third Party Lawsuit, (2) contains any acknowledgment or
representation which suggests any infringement or responsibility of
any Indemnitee, or (3) involves any order, sentence or other consequence that
(a) 

---|---|---

transfer the defense of the Third Party Lawsuit to the Indemnifying Party or
otherwise assume the defense of any Third Party Lawsuit, as long as subject to
the provisions provided in this item (v), in following situations: (a) in
case the Third Party Lawsuit (1) is a public-interest civil action or class
action, (2) may result into risk to the reputation of or image damages to the
Indemnitee, (3) could affect the activities, businesses or operations of the
Indemnitee, notably its standards, positioning or proceedings concerning to
the matter subject of the Lawsuit, or (3) cause a relevant adverse precedent,
(4) create adverse precedent, or (5) could result in criminal liability; or
(b) if the Indemnitee has evidences that the interests of the Indemnifying
Party and of the Indemnitee with respect to the such Lawsuit are in conflict
with one another, and as a result, the Indemnifying Party could not adequately
represent the interests of the Indemnitee in such Lawsuit of the Third Party.
In this case, the Indemnitee shall conduct the defense in a _bona fide_
manner and shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed about the progress of
the defense, and shall obey in relation to any transaction, agreement,
confession or waiver of rights the same procedure established in item (iv)
above, subject to the fact that the Indemnifying Party shall, then, have the
right to keep up with the defense of the Third Party Lawsuit conducted by the
Indemnitee, as well as to request the Indemnitee, and as well as request the
Indemnitee to keep it updated regarding the progress of the Lawsuit,
providing it with periodical reports regarding the lawsuit monthly progress
and copies of such petitions, decisions and relevant documents as reasonably
requested. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | For avoidance of any doubts, the Parties acknowledge that,
regardless of any other provision hereof and which is the Party conducting the
defense of any Third Party Lawsuit, in the event any Indemnitee shall be
required to make any judicial deposits ( _dep ositos judiciais_), place any
guarantee or bond ( _fian ça ou cauçao_) in connection with the defense, pay
or incur into any Loss with any online seizure ( _penhora_ online) or arrest,
seizure or blockage of assets ( _arresto, penhora ou bloqueio de bens_ ), or
if any amounts are determined to be due pursuant to any administrative,
judicial or arbitral order or decision , including injunction and
preliminary injunction, appeal, or provisional execution of all judicial
deposits, guarantees, bonds, blocked assets and payment orders shall be
offered and/or borne by the Indemnifying Party, except as provided in items
(vii) and (viii) below.  
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | Exceptionally in cases of judicial deposits or granting of
personal guarantee ( _fian ça ou cauçao_) that should be paid or granted to
allow the defense of Third Party Lawsuits in relation to which CAP I and CAP
II are not obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section 10.3, Buyer, after the
other Sellers have paid the judicial deposit or granted personal guarantee (or
pay the costs of the bank or insurance company security, if applicable) in
the total amount equal to the judicial deposit or personal guarantee
multiplied by the sum of the Participation Percentages of all Sellers, when
not CAP I and CAP II, shall make or grant, or cause to be made the judicial
deposit or granted the personal guarantee (or pay the costs of the bank or
insurance company security, if applicable) in the total amount equal to the
judicial deposit or personal guarantee multiplied by the sum of the
Participation Percentages of CAP I and CAP II. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties expressly acknowledge that Buyer will not be obligated to make the
judicial deposit or grant personal guarantee of the portion regarding CAP I
and CAP II, if the Sellers, when not CAP I and CAP II, do not make the
judicial deposit or grant personal guarantee that was assigned to them. 
---|---|--- 
 



62 of personal guarantee that shall be made or granted by GSMP, pursuant to this
Section 10.8, if GSMP fails to make the judicial deposit or grant
personal guarantee that is demanded to it, Buyer undertakes to request the
release of the amounts of the Escrow Account of the Seller Guaranteed by
Escrow Account for purposes of making the judicial deposit or granting
personal guarantee in GSMPs name, if (a) there are amounts in the Escrow
Account of the Seller Guaranteed by Escrow Account sufficient to make the
judicial deposit or grant the personal guarantee attributable to GSMP and (b)
Buyer has the right to request such release of the amounts pursuant to
Section 12.2. To the extent the other Sellers, for purposes of ensuring the
conducting of the defense of the Third Party Lawsuit, have already made the
judicial deposit or granted personal guarantee which was attributable to
GSMP, the amount that may be released from the Escrow Account of the Seller
Guaranteed by Escrow Account shall be used by it to reimburse Sellers that
made the judicial deposit or granted personal guarantee of the
portion attributable to GSMP. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
expressly acknowledge that the lack of amounts in the Escrow Account of the
Seller Guaranteed by Escrow Account, due to any reason, shall not have any
effect over the obligation of Sellers of making the judicial deposit or
granting personal guarantee for the defense, according to item (vii) above. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | Sellers shall agree upon and coordinate between themselves
all procedures they wish to take for purposes of assuming and conducting the
defense of any Third Party Lawsuit. Such procedures are not object of
this Agreement and shall be treated between Sellers separately and in no such
way shall they affect the provisions in this Agreement, notably the
responsibility of Sellers for Third Party Lawsuits, pursuant to this
Agreement. The lack of agreement or coordination between Sellers regarding
any aspect of any Third Party Lawsuit or its defense, including the procedures
they take or not take, as well as any non-made judicial deposit or non-granted
personal guarantee by Sellers with the responsibility to indemnify for the
Third Party Lawsuit, shall be equivalent to the decision of the Sellers in not
assuming (or, as the case may be, in not conducting) the defense of a Third
Party Lawsuit. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (x) | In case of withdraw, release or reversion of any judicial
deposit which was made to allow the conducting of the defense of a Third Party
Lawsuit or other paid amount anticipated to meet any decision or order of
a Governmental Authority, including any injunction, anticipated injunction or
provisional execution, such amount, as soon as withdrawn, released or
reversed, shall be transferred to the Party that made it, deducting any
incurred Losses, including with the conducting of the defense of the Third
Party Lawsuit, or with the withdrawn, release or reversion of the judicial
deposit or other amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties expressly
acknowledge that the provisions in this item (x) do not apply to judicial
deposits and other amounts paid or anticipated by STP or by the Subsidiaries,
all of which shall be owned exclusively by STP and the Subsidiaries. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (xi) | For avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that the
provisions of this Section 10.9 shall not be applicable to Existing Lawsuits
Group A and Lawsuits comprised in Ordinary Litigation, which shall be
applicable the provision of Section 10.9. 
---|---|---

Ordinary Litigation regarding the Existing Lawsuits Group A or Ordinary
Litigation, within the term established herein (i) shall not affect the
indemnify obligation of Seller Responsible for Existing Lawsuits Group A and

extent lack of notification results in a relevant loss to the defense or
status of limitation of a right concerning to Existing Lawsuits Group A or

Ordinary Litigation shall have to take the heading of defense of Existing

have the right (but not the obligation) of, at Sellers Responsible for
