clause 11.1.3. The amount payable by the Buyers Guarantor under this
indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this
guarantee if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a

subject to such notifications being given prior to the Release Date or the WandI
Release Date (as applicable), notify the Sellers Representative and the
Management Sellers and Precis Representative of its reasonable estimation of
the amount of any liability in respect of (a) any bona fide Relevant Claim or
(b) any right to recover any sum from a third party (other than the
underwriter of the WandI Policy) in respect of a matter which could give rise to
a Warranty Claim which the Buyer is pursuing against that third party in
accordance with paragraph 6.1 of Schedule 9, and, subject to paragraphs 6.2
to 6.6 below, require that such amount is retained in the Retention Account
notwithstanding the Release Date or the WandI Release Date, pending such

that the Relevant Claim will not be or become a Substantiated Claim (a
"Retained Amount"). 
---|--- 



   6.2 | No withholding of a Retained Amount shall be permitted by the
Buyer unless the Buyer has provided written notice thereof to the Sellers
Representative and the Management Sellers and Precis Representative together

reasons and basis for the notice served pursuant to paragraph 6.1 above (the
"Retained Amount Notice"). The Sellers Representative and/or the Management
Sellers and Precis Representative shall be entitled within 10 Business Days
of the Buyer having served a Retained Amount Notice to give notice to the
Buyer stating that it requires the exercise by the Buyer of its rights in
respect of the Retained Amount in question pursuant to paragraph 6.1, to be

10 years standing and experience in commercial law) ("Queens Counsel").

nominated jointly by the Buyer, the Management Sellers and Precis
Representative and the Sellers Representative (or in default of agreement by
the Chairman for the time being of the Bar Council of England and Wales) and
shall be instructed to act as expert and not as arbitrator and to opine on the
merits and the quantum of the Relevant Claim in question and as to whether
there is a reasonable prospect that such liability or Relevant Claim may be
established by judgement in favour of the Buyer in relation to such liability
or Relevant Claim. For the purposes of paragraph 6, a reasonable prospect
is one with greater than 50% likelihood of success and, for the avoidance of
doubt, in the case of contingent liabilities, the Queens Counsels decision
on the Retained Amount shall be made on the same basis and on the assumption
that the contingent liability will become an actual liability. 
---|--- 



   6.4 | The Queens Counsel shall be entitled to seek the opinion of an
expert in relation to all financial, accounting and actuarial matters provided
always that the Sellers Representative, the Management Sellers and Precis
Representative and the Buyer shall be entitled to make representations to the
Queens Counsel for the purposes of this paragraph 6.4 including as to the
identity of the expert, and shall, to the extent within their control, on
request by either the Buyer or the Sellers Representative or the Management
Sellers and Precis Representative, supply to each other or provide reasonable
access to copies of supporting non-privileged documentation relating to the
Relevant Claim and dispute in question to the extent available in support of
such representations. reasonableness of the Buyers estimation of the Relevant Claim underlying a
Retained Amount shall be conclusive and shall bind the Sellers, the
Management Sellers and the Buyer and the method of proceeding in reference to
the Queens Counsel shall be determined by the Queens Counsel in his absolute
discretion and the Buyer, the Management Sellers and Precis Representative
and the Sellers Representative shall observe and perform any directions which
the Queens Counsel may give and shall be bound by any decision which he may
make consequent upon any failure to observe and perform any such directions.
Costs shall be borne as the Queens Counsel directs. 
---|--- 



   6.6 | To the extent that: 
---|--- 



   6.6.1 | the Queens Counsel should decide that any part of the Retained
Amount was in excess of a reasonable estimate of the amount of the liability
in respect of such Relevant Claim or that there is no reasonable prospect of
a judgement in favour of the Buyer in relation to such Relevant Claim; or 
---|--- 



   6.6.2 | the Buyer, the Management Sellers and Precis Representative
and the Sellers Representative agree that any part of the Retained Amount was
in excess of a reasonable estimate of the amount of the liability in respect
of such Relevant Claim, 
---|--- 

then such amount shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraphs 7.2 and
7.3.

proportions set out opposite their respective names of the Sellers and
Management Sellers in column (8) of Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1).

Completion; 
---|--- 
 



   4.1.2 | the provision for Taxation in the Completion Statement shall be

---|---

occur, arise or become apparent which justify the inclusion of a different
amount in the Completion Statement; 
---|--- 



   4.1.6 |

subject to any other specific policies in this Schedule, where an accrual,
provision or creditor or reduction in assets was made in the Pro
Forma Completion Statement in relation to any matter or series of related
matters, no increase in that accrual,

Statement unless and to the extent that, after the date of this agreement, new
facts or circumstances occur, arise or become apparent which justify the
inclusion of an increased amount in the Completion Statement or to the extent

   4.1.11 | employee and management bonuses shall be dealt with as
follows: 
---|--- 



     | a) | Guaranteed bonuses

Provision will be made in the Completion Statement for the purpose of
calculating the Completion Net Working Capital for guaranteed bonuses as
follows:

Guaranteed Bonus provision = A X B / C

 

Whereby:

A is the budgeted full period bonus (as used for the purposes of preparing
the Pro Forma Completion Statement) for each relevant individual;

B is the number of days from and including the day comprising the start of the
applicable bonus period to and including 30 April 2011; and

 

C is the number of days in the bonus period (e.g 365 days if in respect of an
annual bonus scheme)

---|--- 
 



   5.1.2 | occurs or arises or, such Warranty Claim otherwise having

---|--- 
 



   5.1.3.1 | any voluntary act, event, omission, transaction or

---|--- 



   6. | RECOVERY 
---|--- 



   6.1 |

Where the Buyer or any Group Company is or may be entitled to recover from
some other person (other than the underwriter of the WandI Policy) any sum in
respect of any matter or event which could give rise to a Warranty Claim
against the Warrantor, the person so entitled shall (provided it is first
given an indemnity for all associated costs and expenses in terms reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer) take such reasonable steps as the Sellers
Representative and the Management Sellers and Precis Representative jointly
require in relation to the right to recover that sum from the third party
before making the Warranty Claim (keeping the Sellers Representative and the
Management Sellers and Precis Representative informed of 
  the conduct of such recovery subject only to the extent that privilege in
relation to such information might be lost by providing the same to them or a
Warranty Claim or potential Warranty Claim is not privileged), and any sum
recovered (less the costs of recovery) will reduce the amount of the Warranty
Claim. 

---|--- 



   6.2 | Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 6.1 but subject
always to the provisions of paragraph 6.3 below, if the Buyer is paid an
amount in respect of any Warranty Claim from the Retention Account in
accordance with Schedule 6, and the Buyer or any Group Company subsequently
actually recovers from a third party (including any Taxation Authority) an
amount which is referable to the matter giving rise to such Warranty Claim
which the Buyer is not required under the terms of the WandI Policy to pay to
the underwriter of the WandI Policy, then: 
---|--- 



   6.2.1 | if the amount paid to the Buyer from the Retention Account in
respect of such Warranty Claim is more than the Sum Recovered (as such term is
defined in paragraph 6.3), the Buyer shall (or, where appropriate, shall
procure that the relevant Group Company shall): 
---|--- 



     | 6.2.1.1 | if such Sum Recovered is received by the Buyer prior to
the Release Date as soon as reasonably practicable pay the amount of the Sum
Recovered to the Retention Account; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.2.1.2 | if such Sum Recovered is received by the Buyer after the
Release Date as soon as reasonably practicable pay the amount of the Sum
Recovered to the Sellers and Management Sellers in the proportions set out in
column (8) of Part 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Sellers Solicitors
Account or the Companys Solicitors Account (as appropriate); 
---|---|--- 
 



   6.2.2 | if the amount paid to the Buyer from the Retention Account in
respect of such Warranty Claim is less than or equal to the Sum Recovered, the
Buyer shall:  
---|--- 



     | 6.2.2.1 | if such Sum Recovered is received by the Buyer prior to
the Release Date, as soon as reasonably practicable pay the amount paid to the
Buyer from the Retention Account back to the Retention Account; 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.2.2.2 | if such Sum Recovered is received by the Buyer after the
Release Date as soon as reasonably practicable pay an amount equal to the
amount paid to the Buyer from the Retention Account to the Sellers and
Management Sellers in the proportions set out in column (8) of Part 1 and Part
2 of Schedule 1 to the Sellers Solicitors Account or the Companys
Solicitors Account (as appropriate),  
---|---|--- 

in each case so as to leave the Buyer, taking into account the amounts
received from the third party and from the Retention Account and those
payable to the Seller and Management Sellers under this paragraph 6.2, in no
better or worse position than they would have been in (subject always to the
other provisions of this paragraph 6) had the Warranty Claim not arisen.



   6.3 | For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression "Sum
Recovered" means an amount equal to the amount actually recovered from the
third party plus any interest (less any associated Tax) in respect of the
amount recovered from the third party, less all costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by the Buyer or (as the case may be) the relevant Group Company in
recovering the amount from the third party and any Tax suffered on the
receipt. ---|--- 
 

If any Warranty Claim arises by reason of a liability of any Group Company
which is a contingent liability when the Warranty Claim is notified to the
Sellers Representative and the Management Sellers and Precis Representative,
the Buyer shall not be paid from the Retention Account until the contingent
liability ceases to be contingent and becomes an actual liability and is due
and payable. So long as any Warranty Claim arising by reason of a contingent
liability shall have been notified to the Sellers Representative and the
Management Sellers and Precis Representative in accordance with
paragraph 3.1, paragraph 3.3 shall be amended in relation to such Warranty
Claim so as to require that proceedings be commenced within six months from
the date on which the liability ceases to be contingent.

giving rise to such claim; and 
---|--- 



   8.1.3 | subject always to (i) the provisions of paragraph 8.3 below and
(ii) to the Buyer first being indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction
against all liabilities and reasonable costs and expenses that it may thereby

particulars of the Warranty Claim, and for a period of 30 Business Days after
such notification shall afford the Sellers Representative and the Management
Sellers and Precis Representative the opportunity to take steps to remedy the
matter giving rise to the Warranty Claim. 
---|--- 
 



   8.3 |

The Warrantor acknowledges and agrees that neither the Buyer nor any member of
the Buyers Group (including the Group Companies) shall be required to take,
or 
  omit from taking, any action pursuant to paragraph 8.1 above which, in the
reasonable opinion of the Buyer, could have a material adverse effect on any
aspect of the business carried on by the Buyer or the relevant member of the
Buyers Group or of the Group Companies, including, without limitation a
material adverse effect on such entitys goodwill or its commercial
relationships with third parties.  

---|--- 



   8.4 | Nothing in paragraph 8.1 above shall require the Buyer to give or
delegate, or procure that there is given or delegated, conduct of any claim
proceedings of negotiations to the Sellers Representative and the Management
Sellers and Precis Representative, including, without limitation, the choice
of appointment of professional advisers in connection therewith. 
---|--- 
 



   9. | MITIGATION 
---|--- 

Nothing in this Schedule shall in any way restrict or limit the general
obligation of the Buyer to mitigate any loss or damage which it may suffer in
consequence of any breach by the Warrantor of the Warranties or in consequence
of any matter giving rise to a Warranty Claim against the Warrantor. SCHEDULE 12

Tax Group in the same position it would have been in if the deduction or
withholding had not been required. 
---|--- 



   11.5 | If the Buyer assigns the benefit of this Tax Covenant or this

Tax to the extent that the Buyer could claim under paragraph 2 of this
Schedule but has not received payment in respect of that Tax under paragraph
2.
