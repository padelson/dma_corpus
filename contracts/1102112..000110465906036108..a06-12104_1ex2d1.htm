Common Stock:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Outstanding Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock, excluding Treasury Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, " _Shares_ "),
shall become and be converted into the right to receive that fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "

shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Outstanding Parent Stock_. Each share of Parent Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued
and outstanding share of Parent Stock and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Any shares of Company Common Stock

capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted (" _Treasury Shares_

Company Awards will be treated in accordance with Section 6.19.

  

### 

  

## 3.02. _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time,

as, stockholders of the Company other than to receive the
Merger Consideration. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of
the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

## 

  

## 3.03. _Exchange Procedures_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock in exchange for Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
3.03(g)) pursuant to the provisions of this Article III (such certificates
for shares of Parent Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares
notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including
appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in
Section 3.03(g)) and instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent. Upon the surrender
of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 3.03(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article III and (y) a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.03(h)) of
any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid
upon due surrender of the Certificate, may be issued and/or paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(g)) is surrendered for
exchange in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(g)), there shall be
issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to

  



        
   

  



  

### receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section
3.03(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which
payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and shall represent such
holders proportionate interest in a share of Parent Common Stock based on
the Parent Average Closing Price.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of any certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock of
such stockholders and payment of any cash in respect thereof payable and/or
issuable pursuant to this Agreement upon due surrender of their Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(g)), in
each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent
Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would
be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent to the
applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
issued and outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for shares of Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date
of such event, be the Merger Consideration.

respect either the type of business in which the Company or any of its

ERISA Plan that, assuming the Taxable period of such transaction expired as

or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA in an amount which would be material. Neither the Company nor any of

#### (v) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in Employee participation or
coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Except for such amounts and with respect to
such individuals as are listed in Schedule 5.02(m) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder
adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (v) entitle any Employees to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date

Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement
an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying
with its disclosure obligations under federal or state law; (B) at any time

contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an

its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by Section 6.03(c) of this Agreement and the time likely to be
required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal).

  

## 

  

## 6.07. _Certain Policies_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the

Parent; _provided, however,_ that unless the modification or changes would
otherwise be necessary to be consistent with applicable Law or with
regulatory accounting principles and GAAP, no such modification or change
shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to
satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether
any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as
an admission or acknowledgement by the Company that any such modification or
change is appropriate or required or that any financial statement or
information previously provided by the Company was incorrect in any respect.

omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under the DGCL and the
Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws in effect on the date hereof to
indemnify such Person (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ , the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification); _provided, further,_ that any determination required to be
made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with
the standards set forth under the DGCL and the Company Certificate and the
Company Bylaws shall be made by independent counsel selected by Parent.
Further, Parent shall assume, perform and observe the obligations of the
Company under any agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement to
indemnify those Persons who are or have at any time been directors and
officers of the Company for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Closing Date in their capacity as officers or directors. Parents obligations
under this Section 6.09(a) shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of four (4) years from the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.09, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice
Parent. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses or other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Party will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent;
_provided, further,_ that Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) For a period of four (4) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that portion of directors
and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors (determined as of the
Effective Time) of the Company (as opposed to the portion that serves to
reimburse the Company) with respect to claims against such directors and
officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective
Time, which DandO Insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that
coverage currently provided by the Company; _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall Parent be required to expend on an annual basis more than 100% of
the current amount expended on an annual basis by the Company to maintain or
procure such DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent is unable
to maintain or obtain the DandO Insurance called for by this Section 6.09,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available; _provided, further,_ that officers and
directors of the Company may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to Parents insurance carrier for
the purpose of obtaining such DandO Insurance.

  



  

(d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.09.

  



  

## 6.10. _Benefit Plans_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
agrees that any former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
who continue employment with Parent or its Subsidiaries (such employees "
_Continuing Employees_ ") will be eligible to participate in the employee
benefit plans of Parent (including any severance plan maintained by Parent)
on substantially the same terms and conditions of similarly situated
employees of Parent. Parent will cause such employee benefit plans to take
into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder service by
such Continuing Employees as if such service were with Parent, to the same
extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company
or any

  



        
   

  



  

## of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits). Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent to (i) amend
or terminate any of the Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any
time or (ii) to retain or terminate the employment of any particular
Employee.

  

## 

  

### (b) If any of the Continuing Employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health
plan of Parent, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, to
the extent practicable, each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the
applicable medical, dental or health plans of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the
Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the
Fallbrook National Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan is in the process of being
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board that are effective as
of no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, _provided_
, _however_ , that the effectiveness of such termination may be conditioned
on the consummation of the Merger. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to the review and reasonable and timely approval of Parent.
The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
the Fallbrook National Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan as Parent may
reasonably require, _provided_ , _however_ , that the effectiveness of any
such actions may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, designate a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan of Parent or one of its Affiliates (such plan(s), the "
_Parent 401(k) Savings Plan_ ") that either (i) currently provides for the
receipt from Continuing Employees of "eligible rollover distributions"
(as such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code) or (ii) shall
be amended as soon as practicable following the Effective Date to provide for
the receipt from the Continuing Employees of eligible rollover distributions.
Each Eligible Employee who is a participant in the Parent 401(k) Savings Plan
shall be given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her
account balance and shall be given the opportunity to elect to "roll over"
such account balance to the Parent 401(k) Savings Plan, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of such plan(s) and applicable law. The
Company shall cooperate with Parent to terminate on terms mutually agreeable
to the parties hereto and, if consent of participants is required by the
applicable agreement or plan document or, in the reasonable judgment of the
administrator of such Company program, by applicable Law, the participants in
any salary continuation agreements, supplemental executive retirement plans,
executive bonus agreements and any other non-qualified deferred compensation
plan (collectively " _Deferred Compensation Programs_ "), all Deferred
Compensation Programs, whether or not subject to Section 409A of the Code,
subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of all the Companys conditions
set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, on or prior to the Effective
Time, including the termination or transfer of any insurance policy obtained
in

  



        
   

  



  

### connection therewith and shall, at the request of the Parent, cooperate
with Parent in seeking from such participants their approval of amendments to
any such Deferred Compensation Program to allow for lump sum payments, in
lieu of any continued payments that may be required thereunder, on terms
agreed upon by the parties and such participants.

  

###

shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance
known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together
with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein.

  

## 

  

## 6.13. _Covenant Relating to the Tax Status of the Agreement_. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall take or cause to be taken any action, whether
before or after the Effective Time, that would disqualify or would reasonably
be expected to disqualify the Merger as a **** "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

## 

  

## 6.14. _Human Resources Issues_. The Company will consult in good faith
with Parent regarding the nature and content of any formal presentation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as a group and will include a Parent representative in
any such group presentation or any formal group meeting at which the
transaction is explained or discussed, under an arrangement that is mutually
satisfactory to the parties. The Company agrees to work in good faith with
Parent to facilitate the timely and accurate dissemination of information to
employees regarding matters related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in such a manner as to cause minimal disruption of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective relationships with its
employees and to facilitate the transition of such relationships to Parent or
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be. In addition, prior to making any
written or oral communications to the directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,

other processing support or outside contractors to assist Parent in
performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion
of the data and other files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries

action of the Company Board if:

  

## 

  

### (a) (i) The Company is not in material breach of any of the terms of this
Agreement, (ii) the Company Board authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into an Alternative

Parent does not make, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the
Companys written notification of its intention to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, an offer that the Company Board determines, in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisors, is at least
as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of the
Company as the Superior Proposal and (iv) the Company prior to such
termination pays to Parent in immediately available funds any fees required
to be paid pursuant to Section 8.05(b). The Company agrees (x) that it will
not enter into the binding agreement referred to in clause (ii) above until

required thereby, (y) to notify Parent promptly if its intention to enter
into the written agreement referred to in its notification shall change at

Day period, to negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to any

proposed by Parent in response to a Superior Proposal, if any.

  

### 

  

### (b) There has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Parent in this Agreement, or any such representation and
warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that
Sections 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or
condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after
written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (c) There is a material breach by one or more Stockholders who is or are
a shareholder(s) of Parent of any of his or her representations or warranties
or any of his or her covenants or obligations contained in his or her

###

this Agreement within forty-eight (48) hours following the date of such event
and (4) Parent does not elect to pursue a Decline Adjustment as set forth
below; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if Parent effects a stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction after the date hereof and prior to the date on
which the Parent Average Closing Price is determined, the provisions of this
Section 8.03(d) shall be appropriately adjusted so that such event does not

have the following meanings:

  

### 

  

#### (i) " _Initial Index_ " shall mean 111.48.

Initial Price and (ii) .85, which is referred to as the " _Minimum Adjustment
Price_ ".

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) A decrease is not " _proportionate relative to the Index_ " if the
quotient obtained by dividing the Parent Average Closing Price by the Parent
Initial Price is less than the quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index
by the Initial Index and subtracting 0.15 from the quotient.

  

#### 

  

Notwithstanding any decrease in the price of Parent Common Stock, as set
forth in this Section 8.03(d), the Company shall not be entitled to terminate

derived by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the quotient obtained by

## 8.04. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether

## 

  

### (a) There has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company.

  

### 

  

### (b) There is a material breach by one or more Stockholders who is or are
a stockholder(s) of the Company of any of his or her representations or
warranties or any of his or her covenants or obligations contained in his or

or her Shares in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, if such breach has
resulted in the failure of this Agreement to be adopted by the stockholders
of the Company and cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days
after the giving of written notice thereof to the breaching Stockholder(s).

  

### 

  

### (c) [intentionally omitted]

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) The Company shall have breached Section 6.06; the Company Board shall

this Agreement and the Merger as promptly as practicable (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days) after receipt of any written request to do so
from Parent; or a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been publicly disclosed (other than by Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent) and the Company Board recommends that the
stockholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender
or exchange offer, the Company Board fails to recommend unequivocally against
acceptance of such offer.

within forty-eight (48) hours following the date of such event and (4)
the Company does not elect to pursue an Increase Adjustment as set forth
below; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if Parent effects a stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction after the date hereof and prior to the date on
which the Parent Average Closing Price is determined, the provisions of this
Section 8.04(e) shall be appropriately adjusted so that such event does not
in and of itself trigger a termination right on behalf of the Parent. For
purposes hereof, the following terms have the following meanings:

  

### 

  

#### (i) A " _significant increase_ " shall be deemed to have occurred if
the Parent Average Closing Price is greater than the product of (i) the
Parent Initial Price and (ii) 1.15, which is referred to as the " _Maximum
Adjustment Price_ ".

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) An increase is not " _proportionate relative to the Index_ " if
the quotient obtained by dividing the Parent Average Closing Price by
the Parent Initial Price is greater than the quotient obtained by dividing
the Final Index by the Initial Index and adding 0.15 to the quotient.

  

#### 

  

Notwithstanding any increase in the price of Parent Common Stock, as set
forth in this Section 8.04(e), Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.04(e) if (i) the Company elects, no
later than the close of business on the second succeeding Business Day after
the close of the Parent Measuring Period, to adjust the Exchange Ratio (an "
_Increase Adjustment_ ") such that the Exchange Ratio shall equal the number
derived by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the quotient obtained by
dividing the Maximum Adjustment Price by the Parent Average Closing Price or

into a definitive agreement with respect to the acquisition of Parent by a
third party.

  



  

## 8.05. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to
this Article VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability or further obligation of any kind on the part

  



        
   

  



  

## of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents, legal and financial advisors or other representatives), except (i) as

Proposal with respect to the Company and (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to (x) Section 8.02(a)

termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates an Acquisition
Proposal;

  

#####

this Agreement; and _provided_ _further_ that with respect to clause (1)
above, the Termination Fee shall be paid prior to the Companys entering into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or consummating, approving or
recommending an Acquisition Proposal or within two Business Days following
notice from Parent if the Company shall have failed to oppose such
Acquisition Proposal.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Notwithstanding any Termination Fee paid to Parent, such
Termination Fee shall upon payment thereof be the sole remedy for Parent with
respect to any breach of any covenant or agreement giving rise to such
payment, subject to Section 8.05(c).

  

#### 

  

### (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in paragraph
(b) above are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without such agreements Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty. If
the Company fails to promptly pay Parent any amounts due under paragraph (b)
above within the time period specified therein, the Company shall pay all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent from the
date such amounts were
