THIS SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of August 15, 2014, by and among Schrader International, Inc., an exempted
company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman
Islands ("Seller"), Sensata Technologies B.V., a private limited company
organized under the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands ("Buyer"), and, for

Netherlands ("Parent"). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms
used herein are defined in Exhibit A attached hereto.

WHEREAS, the Company Entities are engaged in the design, development,
manufacture, marketing, advertising, distribution and sale of tire pressure

on-site product training and other services, for original equipment
manufacturers and after-market customers (the "Business");

WHEREAS, Seller is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and
outstanding shares in August Cayman Company, Inc., an exempted company
incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the
"Company"), each with par value of $1.00 (the "Shares");

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, Buyer
desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to Buyer, all of
the Shares;

WHEREAS, Schrader France is an indirect Subsidiary of the Company and, under
French labor Law, the works council of Schrader France must be informed and

Shares") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors (or equivalent governing bodies)
of Buyer, Parent and Seller have approved this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants herein contained, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

written direction of Buyer). 

1B. Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares (the "Purchase
Price") shall be an amount equal to: (i) the Base Purchase Price, minus (ii)
Closing Net Indebtedness, plus (iii) the amount (if any) by which the Closing
Net Working Capital exceeds $78,400,000, minus (iv) the amount (if any) by

date specified by Buyer on not less than two (2) Business Days prior written
notice to Seller (such notice, the "Closing Date Notice"), or (ii) such other

(the "Parent Release");

(b) to the Escrow Agent, the Adjustment Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for deposit into a separate escrow account (the

agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (the
"Adjustment Escrow Agreement"), by and among Buyer, Seller and the Escrow
Agent; and

(c) to the intended beneficiaries thereof (as identified in writing by Seller
to Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days prior to Closing), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated in writing by
Seller, (1) amounts due and owing pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (2) the
Company Expenses, and (3) any other liabilities included in the computation of
Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness which by their terms or pursuant to this
Agreement are required to be paid at the Closing.

1E. Purchase Price Adjustment.

(i) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing (or, if later, two
(2) Business Days after delivery of the Closing Date Notice), Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer (a) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of
August Cayman Intermediate and its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment
Calculation Time (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), and (b) a statement
(the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth Seller's good faith estimate
of the Closing Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital"), the Closing Net Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Net
Indebtedness") and the Purchase Price resulting therefrom (the "Estimated
Purchase Price"), which Estimated Purchase Price, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall be calculated as the result equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price, minus
(ii) the Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness, plus (iii) the amount (if any) by
which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds $78,400,000, minus
(iv) the amount (if any) by which $68,400,000 exceeds the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared on
a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with the methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and
principles used in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet. The Estimated
Closing Statement shall, with respect to the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital and any Cash included in the Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness, be
derived from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, and shall, with respect to
the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Net
Indebtedness and the Estimated Purchase Price resulting therefrom, be prepared
in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement. From and after delivery
of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement
until the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company Entities to, (1)
provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access at all reasonable
times during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the
books and records, supporting data, facilities and employees of the Company
Entities (including all work papers and other documents and all relevant
personnel responsible for accounting and finance) and the Company Entities'
accountants and advisors, in each case to the extent reasonably requested by
Buyer or any of its Representatives in connection with their review of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement, and (2)
cooperate with Buyer and its Representatives in connection with their review
of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement.

(ii) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller (a) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of August
Cayman Intermediate and its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time
(the "Closing Balance Sheet"), and (b) a statement (the "Closing Statement")
setting forth Buyer's calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Net Indebtedness and the Purchase Price resulting therefrom. The
Closing Balance Sheet shall be 

prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the methodologies, practices, estimation techniques,
assumptions and principles used in the preparation of the Latest Balance
Sheet. The Closing Statement shall, with respect to the Closing Net Working
Capital and any Cash included in the Closing Net Indebtedness, be derived from
the Closing Balance Sheet, and shall, with respect to the Closing Net Working
Capital and the Closing Net Indebtedness and the Purchase Price resulting
therefrom, be prepared in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement.
After Seller's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company Entities to, (1) provide Seller and
its Representatives with reasonable access at all reasonable times during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the books and
records, supporting data, facilities and employees of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company Entities) (including all work papers and
other documents and all relevant personnel responsible for accounting and
finance) and their accountants and advisors, in each case to the extent
reasonably requested by Seller or any of its Representatives in connection
with their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and
(2) cooperate with Seller and its Representatives in connection with their
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement.

(iii) The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and the Closing Net
Working Capital, the Closing Net Indebtedness and the Purchase Price set forth
thereon, shall become final and binding upon the parties sixty (60) days
following Seller's receipt thereof unless Seller gives written notice of its
good faith disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer prior to such
date; provided that the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and
the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Net Indebtedness and the Purchase
Price set forth thereon, shall become final and binding upon the parties upon
Seller's delivery, prior to the expiration of such sixty (60)-day period, of
written notice to Buyer of its acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement, and the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Net
Indebtedness and the Purchase Price set forth thereon. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
disagreement so asserted.

(iv) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Seller, then the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with
this Section 1E(iv)), and the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Net
Indebtedness and the Purchase Price set forth thereon, shall become final and
binding upon the parties on the earlier of (a) the date all matters specified
in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in writing by Buyer and
Seller and (b) the date all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
not resolved by Buyer and Seller are finally resolved in writing by a
nationally recognized accounting, consulting or valuation firm (other than a
so-called "Big Four" accounting firm) mutually selected by Buyer and Seller
(such firm, the "Arbiter"). The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect any mutually
agreed final resolution by Buyer and Seller and/or any final resolution made
by the Arbiter in accordance with this Section 1E(iv). During the thirty (30)
days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, or such
longer period as Buyer and Seller may agree in writing, Buyer and Seller shall
seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have
with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and all
such discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and
Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule. At
the end of such thirty (30)-day period or such agreed-upon longer period,
Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Arbiter for review and resolution all
matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and which were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and Seller shall
instruct the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make a final determination of
the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (but
only to the extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. Buyer and Seller will
cooperate with the Arbiter during the term of its engagement. Buyer and Seller
shall instruct the Arbiter not to, and the Arbiter shall not, assign a value
to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned
by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other 

hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the
one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. Buyer and Seller shall also instruct
the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make its determination based solely on
written presentations by Buyer and Seller that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis
of an independent review). The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement, and the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Net Indebtedness
and the Purchase Price set forth thereon, shall become final and binding on
the parties hereto on the date the Arbiter delivers its final resolution in
writing to Buyer and Seller (which final resolution shall be requested by the
parties to be delivered not more than thirty (30) days following submission of
such disputed matters), and such resolution by the Arbiter shall not be
subject to court review or otherwise appealable. The fees and expenses of the
Arbiter pursuant to this Section 1E(iv) shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by
Seller.

(v) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 1E (such shortfall, the "Adjustment
Amount"), then within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Statement, and the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing
Net Indebtedness and the Purchase Price set forth thereon, become final and
binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1E, (a) Buyer shall make
payment to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified in writing by Seller, of the Adjustment Amount, and (b)
Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to make payment as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days after receipt of such joint written instructions) to Seller,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by Seller, of all of the Adjustment Escrow Funds then contained in the
Adjustment Escrow Account.

(vi) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 1E (such excess, the
"Excess Amount"), then within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement, and the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Net Indebtedness and the Purchase Price set forth thereon, become
final and binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1E, Buyer and Seller
shall (a) deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to make
payment as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after receipt of such joint written instructions) to Buyer, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by Buyer, of the Excess Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Funds then
contained in the Adjustment Escrow Account, and (b) if the Excess Amount is
less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds then contained in the Adjustment Escrow
Account, simultaneously with delivery of the joint written instructions
contemplated by the immediately foregoing clause (a), deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to make payment as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt of
such joint written instructions) to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified in writing by Seller, of all of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account after
giving effect to the payment to Buyer contemplated by the immediately
foregoing clause (a).

(vii) Buyer agrees that (a) the net indebtedness adjustment and the working
capital adjustment provided for in this Section 1E, and the dispute resolution
provisions provided for in this Section 1E, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies for the matters addressed or that could be addressed by this Section
1E, (b) the payment of the Excess Amount (if any) from the Adjustment Escrow
Funds then contained in the Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to and in
accordance with this Section 1E shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Buyer for payment of the Excess Amount (if any), and (c) the Adjustment Escrow
Funds contained from time to time in the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be
Buyer's sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 1E, even if the Excess Amount exceeds the Adjustment
Escrow Funds contained in the Adjustment Escrow Account. For the avoidance of
doubt, and without limiting the generality of the 

foregoing, no claim by Buyer for the payment of the Excess Amount shall be
asserted against any of the Seller Parties.

(viii) Buyer agrees that following the Closing it will not, and it will cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Company Entities) not to, take any actions
with respect to the accounting books, records, methodologies, practices,
estimation techniques, assumptions and principles of the Company Entities that
would obstruct or prevent the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet or the
Closing Statement as provided in this Section 1E.

1F. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent shall each be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Purchase Price or any other payment required to be made
hereunder or under the Adjustment Escrow Agreement such amounts as Buyer,
Seller or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any applicable
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law; provided that the
withholding party gives at least three (3) Business Day's prior written notice
identifying the underlying legal requirement for any proposed withholding to
the party to be withheld upon. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted
or withheld by Buyer, Seller or the Escrow Agent, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made, and Buyer, Seller or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall disburse
such deducted or withheld amounts to the applicable Tax authority on a timely
basis.

1G. Offer to Purchase Schrader France; Works Council Consultation.

(i) Buyer hereby irrevocably offers (the "Offer") to purchase directly or
indirectly all of the Schrader France Shares on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein for $60,000,000 (the "French Purchase Price"). The
Offer shall remain binding, open and irrevocable until, and shall only expire
upon, the earlier of (a) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article 6 and (b) 11:59 p.m. (Denver, Colorado time) on the later of (A) the
tenth (10th) Business Day after the completion of the Works Council
Consultation (the date of such completion, the "Work Date Consultation
Completion Date") and (B) the sixtieth (60th) day after the date hereof,
unless extended by agreement of Buyer and Seller (the "Offer Period").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless
and until Seller has executed and delivered to Buyer the Acceptance Notice (as
defined below), (x) the provisions of this Article 1 shall not be effective
with respect to the Schrader France Shares (provided that the other provisions
of this Agreement shall continue to apply to the Schrader France Shares), (y)
for purposes of this Article 1 (and only this Article 1), the Company's
indirect interest in the Schrader France Shares shall not be considered to be
purchased by Buyer pursuant to Section 1A, and (z) the Base Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the French Purchase Price.

(ii) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, under French labor Law, the
Works Council Consultation must be completed prior to Seller entering into any
binding agreement in respect of the sale of Schrader France and that Seller is
and shall be under no obligation whatsoever to accept the Offer or sell the
Schrader France Shares hereunder.

(iii) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three (3)
Business Days following the date hereof, Seller shall cause Schrader France to
initiate the Works Council Consultation by delivery of a notice in
substantially the form of Exhibit E attached hereto, which Buyer and Seller
have determined in good faith is all of the information that they reasonably
believe is necessary for the works council to render its opinion (the "Works
Council Notice"), and will use, and will cause Schrader France to use, its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable (in
each case, to the extent consistent with its obligations under Law), to agree
with the works' council on a 

reasonable time schedule for the Works Council Consultation to complete the
Works Council Consultation as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof and in any event prior to the thirty-fifth (35th) day after the date
hereof. Buyer shall cooperate in good faith, as may be reasonably requested by
Seller, with Seller and Schrader France in all such efforts, including (to the
extent permitted by Law and this Agreement) by providing any documents and
information relating to Buyer and its Subsidiaries that may be reasonably
requested by Seller or the works council of Schrader France in connection with
the Works Council Consultation, to the extent such documents and information
are reasonably available and by making available relevant personnel, as
reasonably requested by, and upon reasonable prior notice from, Seller, to
attend meetings of the works council of Schrader France. Seller shall keep
Buyer regularly informed of the status of the Works Council Consultation and,
if applicable, provide Buyer with a true and certified copy of the final
opinion delivered by the works council (or the minutes of the meeting of the
works council at which such opinion was given) promptly following receipt
thereof. To the extent permitted by Law and applicable to the Works Council
Consultation, Seller shall (and shall cause Schrader France to) provide in
advance copies to Buyer of any proposed additional written correspondence,
notices or other communications (including any supporting materials) to be
made by Seller or Schrader France in connection with the Works Council
Consultation, and shall consult with Buyer in connection with such
communications and consider in good faith any comments that Buyer may make
thereon. Without Buyer's prior written consent at its sole discretion, Seller
shall not (and shall cause Schrader France not to) enter into any material
agreement or understanding with, or make any material commitment to, the works
council of Schrader France as part of the Works Council Consultation that
would bind Buyer or Schrader France or impose any obligations on Buyer or
Schrader France after the Closing. Buyer and Seller shall each use reasonable
best efforts to refrain from (and to cause their respective Affiliates to
refrain from) taking any action (or omitting to take any action) that would
reasonably be likely to prejudice the expeditious completion of the Works
Council Consultation and delivery of the opinion of the works council of
Schrader France in respect of the indirect change of control of Schrader
France contemplated by this Agreement for purposes of French labor Law
(including the making of any statement that contradicts (or the failure to
promptly reaffirm as and when requested) any statement contained in the Works
Council Notice) and Buyer shall promptly inform Seller if, at any time prior
to the Works Council Consultation Completion Date, of any additional steps
that it has determined that Seller must take, and any additional information
that it has determined that Seller must provide, in Buyer's good faith
opinion, in order to cause the Works Council Consultation to be completed.

(iv) If, as a result of statements made by the works council in connection
with the Works Council Consultation, changes to the Offer, or further
arrangements in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, are
considered necessary, Seller shall, after consultation with Buyer, negotiate
in good faith on such changes (if any) to the Offer, or further arrangements
(if any) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that are
appropriate. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and its relevant
French Affiliates in connection with the Works Council Consultation (but shall
be under no obligation to agree to any amendments to the Offer, or to offer
any concessions).

(v) On or after the Works Council Consultation Completion Date (but prior to
the expiration of the Offer Period), Seller shall deliver a written notice to
Buyer indicating its acceptance of the Offer (the "Acceptance Notice") or its
rejection of the Offer (the "Rejection Notice"); provided, that any Acceptance
Notice shall be contingent on the consummation of the Closing. For all
purposes of this Agreement and the Offer, completion of the Works Council
Consultation shall be deemed to have occurred upon the earlier of (a) the
delivery by the works council of its written opinion in respect of the
indirect change of control of Schrader France contemplated by this Agreement
for purposes of French labor Law, (b) if the minutes of the meeting during
which an opinion described in clause (a) was delivered has not been approved
by the members of the works council within three (3) Business Days 

after the date of such meeting, the delivery of a written statement of the
president of the works council confirming that the opinion was delivered, (c)
the expiration of the maximum period available under applicable Law for such
works council to issue its opinion, as determined reasonably and in good faith
by Seller and (d) a written decision of the relevant Governmental Authority
that the Works Council Consultation has been completed.

(vi) If Seller delivers an Acceptance Notice prior to the Closing Date, then
the acquisition by Buyer of all of the Schrader France Shares contemplated
under the Offer shall be realized indirectly through the acquisition of all of
the Shares under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;
provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary the aggregate purchase
price for the Shares shall remain exclusively determined by Section 1B and
Section 1E (it being understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the
consideration for the purchase of all of the Schrader France Shares is
reflected in the Base Purchase Price).

1H. Separate Purchase of Certain Company Entities. Provided that such
amendment and other documents are delivered to Seller not less than thirty
(30) days prior to the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur
pursuant to Section 1C (or such lesser number of Business Days as Seller may
agree), Seller agrees to consider in good faith (and reasonably cooperate with
Buyer in connection with Buyer's preparation of) a proposed amendment to this
Agreement, as well as drafts of all documents required under local Law,
pursuant to which Buyer or one or more of its wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiaries would purchase directly all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock (or the equivalent) of August Lux Holding Company, August
France Holding Company and/or August Lux UK Holding Company on the Closing
Date following the repayment in full of all amounts due and owing under the
Credit Agreement and immediately prior to the purchase of the Shares (and
thereby all other Company Entities) by Buyer from Seller at the Closing, and
Seller shall consent to the execution of such amendment and other documents
(which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, delayed or
denied) provided that in Seller's reasonable judgment (x) such proposed
amendment or other documents do not and would not reasonably be expected to
(1) decrease the Purchase Price (including by virtue of any increase in Net
Indebtedness or any decrease in Net Working Capital (which shall be measured
without giving effect to any transaction contemplated by this Section 1H))
payable to Seller at Closing, (2) result in any additional or incremental
fees, costs, Taxes, Tax or other risks, expenses or other Liabilities on any
Seller Party (and/or its direct or indirect owners), (3) require any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements (other than those
contained in this Agreement) that would survive Closing (and the provisions of
Section 8A would be revised as part of such amendment to reflect the same),
(4) delay closing, or (5) include any additional conditions to the obligation
of either Buyer and Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or thereby or otherwise impede or delay the Closing, and (y) no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller shall be deemed untrue or not
performed (including the representations and warranties in Section 3F and the
covenants in Section 5B) as a result of such proposed amendment. Buyer shall
be solely responsible for, and shall solely bear and pay all fees, costs,
Taxes and expenses (including all fees, costs and expenses of counsel and
notaries) related to, the preparation, negotiation, and execution of any such
amendment and any other documents or otherwise related to the transfer of any
Company Entity (and no such fees, costs, Taxes or expenses shall be included
in the calculation of Net Indebtedness or Net Working Capital). Any such
amendment or other documents shall be consistent with this Section 1H, shall
contain an indemnity in favor of the Seller Parties with respect to the
matters referred to herein and shall otherwise be in form and substance
satisfactory to Seller.

and is validly existing and, if applicable, in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority

as it is now being conducted. True, correct and complete copies of the
Organizational Documents of Seller have been previously made available to
Buyer. Seller is duly licensed or qualified and in good standing as a foreign
corporation (or other entity, if applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership of its properties or the character of its activities is such as to
require it to be so 

licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

3B. Company Entities' Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company
Entities has been duly organized and is validly existing and, where
applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite power and authority to own or lease all of

of each of the Company Entities have been previously made available to Buyer.
Each of the Company Entities is duly licensed or qualified and in good
standing as a foreign corporation (or other entity, if applicable) in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership of its properties or the character of its
activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a

respect, or result in the material modification, termination or acceleration
of, any obligation under, constitute a material default or create any right to

Material Contract, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
Shares or any of the material properties or assets of any Company Entity, or
result in a violation or revocation of any required material permit or
approval from any Governmental Authority, or constitute an event that, after
notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any such material violation,
conflict, breach, modification, termination, acceleration, consent
requirement, creation of a Lien or violation or revocation of a required
material permit or approval from a Governmental Authority.

3E. Governmental Authorities; Consents. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement, no
material consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required on the part of Seller with

3F. Capitalization. Section 3F of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth the

in each such Company Entity, together with the ownership thereof. All such
shares or other equity interests have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are (to the extent applicable) fully paid and nonassessable and were
issued free of preemptive rights. Seller owns of record and beneficially all
of the outstanding Shares free and clear of all Liens other than Other Liens.
Except as set forth on Section 3F of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Company

forth in Section 3F of the Seller Disclosure Letter, no Company Entity has
authorized or granted any outstanding options, warrants, rights or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of such Company Entity, or any other
commitments or agreements providing for the issuance of additional shares, the
sale of treasury shares or for the repurchase or redemption of shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of such Company Entity, and there are
no agreements of any kind that obligate such Company Entity to issue,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its shares of capital stock or
other equity interests. No shares of capital stock or other equity interests
are held in treasury by any Company Entity. There are no stock appreciation,
phantom stock, profit participation or similar rights with respect to any
Company Entity.

financial position of August Cayman Intermediate and its Subsidiaries as of
their respective dates and for the periods covered thereby in conformity with
GAAP (except in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, (a) for

Except as set forth in Section 3J of the Seller Disclosure Letter, no Company
Entity is subject to any Governmental Order that impairs a Company Entity from

service provider of any of the Company Entities to payment, or accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or benefits
due to any such individual.

have been established on the accounting statements of the applicable Company
Entity to the extent required by applicable accounting standards.

(h) To the knowledge of Seller, since April 27, 2012, no employee of any

of the Company Entities (A) has any present intention to terminate his or her
employment with the Company Entities or (B) is in violation of any employment

obligated to grant to any Person any right to any material Intellectual
Property owned by, or licensed to, any of the Company Entities, as a result of

Except as set forth in Section 3S(i)(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, to

relating to any of the Company Entities, any real property currently or
formerly owned or operated by any of the Company Entities since April 27,
2012, the operation of the Business, or any asset of the Company Entities.

ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

As an inducement to Seller to enter into this Agreement, Buyer hereby
represents and warrants to Seller that, except as set forth in the Buyer
Disclosure Letter:

4A. Organization. Buyer has been duly organized and is validly existing and,
if applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. True, correct and complete copies of the Organizational Documents
of Buyer have been previously made available to Seller. Buyer is duly licensed
or qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation (or other entity,
if applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or
the character of its activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
its ability to enter into this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

4B. Due Authorization. Buyer has all requisite power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or
will be party and (subject to the approvals discussed below) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or will be party
by Buyer and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and validly authorized and approved by all corporate or
other action, and no other proceeding on the part of Buyer is necessary to
authorize this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or will
be party. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or
will be party has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable
against Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity.

4C. No Conflict. Except as set forth in Section 4C of the Buyer Disclosure
Letter, subject to the receipt of the consents, approvals, authorizations and
other requirements set forth in Section 4E or in Section 4E of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or will be party by Buyer and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
will not violate any provision of, conflict with or result in the breach of,
any applicable Law, the Organizational Documents of Buyer or any Subsidiary of
Buyer, or any material Contract to which Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer is a
party or by which Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer may be bound, or give any
Person the right to modify, terminate or accelerate, or result in the
modification, termination or acceleration of, any obligation under, constitute
a default or create any right to payment under, any such Contract, or result
in the creation of any Lien upon any of the material properties or assets of
Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer, or result in a violation or revocation of
any required material permit or approval from any Governmental Authority, or
constitute an event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would result
in any such violation, conflict, breach, modification, termination,
acceleration, creation of a Lien or violation or revocation of a permit or
approval.

4D. Litigation and Proceedings. There are no claims, charges, actions, suits,
audits, assessments, arbitrations or other proceedings at law or in equity,
or, to the knowledge of Buyer, investigations, pending or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, threatened, against Buyer by or before (or that could come by or
before) any Governmental Authority that, if determined adversely, would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its ability to
enter into this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
There is no unsatisfied judgment or 

any open injunction binding upon Buyer that would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on its ability to enter into this Agreement or
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

4E. Governmental Authorities; Consents. Assuming the truth of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, no
consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing
with, any Governmental Authority or other Person is required on the part of
Buyer with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement by Buyer or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, except for (i) applicable requirements of the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and (ii) as otherwise disclosed in Section
4E of the Buyer Disclosure Letter.

4F. Financial Ability. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has received an
executed debt commitment letter dated the date hereof (the "Debt Commitment
Letter") from Barclays Bank PLC and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.,
pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to Buyer the amount of
financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Debt Financing") to
complete the transactions contemplated hereby. A true and complete copy of the
Debt Commitment Letter, including the fee letter and the engagement letter
related to the Debt Commitment Letter (including all "market flex" terms and
conditions to which the Debt Commitment Letter is subject, but redacted to
remove the amount of the fees, pricing caps and other economic terms set forth
therein (none of which would adversely affect the amount (other than inclusion
of any "original issue discount") or availability of the Debt Financing) is
attached hereto as Exhibit H and, other than the Debt Commitment Letter (and
the related fee letter and engagement letter) attached hereto, there are no
side letters or other agreements related to the Debt Financing. Buyer has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt
Commitment Letter (and the related fee letter and engagement letter) to be
paid on or before the date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment
Letter is valid, binding and in full force and effect with respect to Buyer
and, to the knowledge of Buyer, with respect to the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter, and no event has occurred with respect to Buyer or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, with respect to any other party to the Debt Commitment
Letter which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would, as of the
date hereof, reasonably be expected to constitute a failure of any condition
under the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent related to
the funding of the full amounts contemplated by the Debt Financing other than
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Subject to the satisfaction of all
conditions precedent related to the funding of the Debt Financing and assuming
the accuracy of all representations and warranties of Seller, the aggregate
proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, together with available
cash of Buyer, will be sufficient for Buyer to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be completed at the Closing, and to satisfy
all of the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, including (i) paying the
Purchase Price, (ii) effecting the repayment or refinancing of any Net
Indebtedness of the Company Entities to the extent included in Estimated Net
Indebtedness to be repaid or refinanced on the Closing Date in accordance with
this Agreement and (iii) paying all of Buyer's related fees and expenses.
Neither the fee letter between Buyer and the lenders referred to in the Debt
Commitment Letter nor any other Contract between any lender or other financing
source, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, contains provisions that could reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter such that the representation and
warranty in the immediately foregoing sentence is untrue (other than the
conditions precedent expressly set forth in the Buyer Debt Documents). As of
the date hereof, assuming the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects and
the performance of all obligations and compliance with all covenants and
agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with at or
prior to the Closing by Seller in all material respects, Buyer has no
knowledge that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing required to be
satisfied by it (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any conditions thereto
contained in the Buyer Debt Documents) would not reasonably be expected to be
satisfied at or prior to the Closing. 

4G. Brokers' Fees. Except fees described in Section 4G of the Buyer Disclosure
Letter (which fees shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer), no broker,
finder, investment banker or other Person is entitled to any brokerage fee,
finders' fee or other commission (contingent or otherwise) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

4H. Acquisition of Interests for Investment. Buyer has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of its participation in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyer confirms that Seller made available to Buyer and Buyer's
agents the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management
employees of the Company Entities as well as access to the documents,
information and records of the Company Entities and to acquire additional
information about the business and financial condition of the Company
Entities, and Buyer confirms that it has made an independent investigation,
analysis and evaluation of the Company Entities and their respective
properties, assets, business, financial condition, documents, information and
records. Buyer is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view
toward or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof in violation of
the Securities Act. Buyer understands and agrees that the Shares may not be
sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to
an exemption from such registration available under the Securities Act, and
without compliance with state, local and foreign securities Laws, in each
case, to the extent applicable.

ARTICLE 5

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

5A. Access; Assistance with Debt Financing.

(i) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
Seller shall grant to Buyer and its authorized Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records of the Company Entities that are in the
possession or under the control of the Company Entities; provided that (a)
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of any
Company Entity, (b) all requests for such access shall be directed to Hugh
Charvat or such other Person(s) as the Company may designate in writing from
time to time (collectively, the "Designated Contacts"), and (c) nothing herein
shall require Seller to provide access to, or to disclose any information to,
Buyer or any of its Representatives if such access or disclosure (1) would
cause significant competitive harm to the Company Entities if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (2) would waive any legal
privilege or (3) would be in violation of applicable Law of any Governmental
Authority (including the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws) or
the provisions of any agreement to which any Company Entity is a party;
provided, however, that Buyer and Seller shall (and Seller shall cause the
Company Entities to) cooperate to determine a method to allow the disclosure
of as much of such information as is reasonably practicable to the extent
doing so would not, in good faith, be likely to result in the creation of any
such competitive harm or be reasonably likely to result in the loss of such
privilege. Other than the Designated Contacts or as expressly provided in the
preceding sentence, Buyer is not authorized to and shall not (and shall cause
its employees, agents, advisors, counsel, Representatives and Affiliates not
to) contact any officer, director, employee, union representative or officer,
customer, supplier, distributor, lessee, lessor, lender, noteholder or other
material business relation of any Company Entity prior to the Closing, except
in consultation with Seller and then only with the prior approval of Seller,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement with respect to such access and any information furnished to it or
its Representatives pursuant to this Section 5A. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the access provided for in this Section 5A or any other
obligation of Seller hereunder include any right of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to conduct any sampling or 

analysis of environmental media of the nature commonly referred to as a "Phase
II Environmental Investigation," such as any soil or groundwater testing.

(ii) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 5A, and unless otherwise
agreed by Buyer, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide, shall
cause the Company Entities to use reasonable best efforts to provide, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company
Entities to provide, in each case in a timely manner, all reasonable
cooperation and assistance to Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing that is customary for such financings, including, as requested,
using reasonable best efforts to: (a) make appropriate officers available for
participation in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions,
presentations, drafting sessions, sessions with ratings agencies and
prospective financing sources and road shows, to assist in the preparation of
bank books and similar documents and in connection with the execution and
delivery of any definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested
by Buyer or any prospective lender to Buyer at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, (b) assist with the timely preparation of customary
rating agency presentations, road show materials, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and bank syndication materials, offering documents, private
placement memoranda and similar documents customarily required in connection
with debt financings similar to the Debt Financing, including the marketing
and syndication thereof, (c) provided that such requests are timely made so as
not to delay the Closing beyond the date it would otherwise occur, furnish
Buyer and its Financing Sources with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the Company Entities as is reasonably
requested by Buyer or any prospective lender to Buyer and is customarily
required for completion of debt financings similar to the Debt Financing
(including such information regarding the Company Entities that is needed so
that Buyer can prepare pro forma financials), (d) reasonable cooperation with
customary marketing efforts of Buyer and its Financing Sources for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing, (e) providing and executing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, including (I) documents requested by Buyer or its Financing
Sources relating to the repayment of the Credit Agreement and the release of
related Liens, including the Payoff Letter and (to the extent reasonably
required) evidence that notice of such repayment has been timely delivered to
the holders of such debt; (II) all documentation and other information
required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act,
which is requested at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
and (III) customary agreements, documents or certificates that facilitate the
creation, perfection or enforcement of Liens securing the Debt Financing as
are customary and reasonably requested by Buyer or its Financing Sources at
least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, (f) using reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with the Financing Sources' due diligence
investigation in connection with any proposed issuance and sale of senior
notes to the extent customary and reasonable, (g) requesting its independent
accountants to provide assistance and cooperation to Buyer, including
requesting their participation in drafting sessions and accounting due
diligence sessions and requesting that they agree that Buyer may use their
audit reports relating to the Company and that they provide customary comfort
letters and (h) assist in the preparation of any customary offering documents
in connection with the Debt Financing, including providing the Financial
Statements and Additional Financial Statements; provided, that nothing herein
shall require (1) such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company Entities or (2)
Seller to cause the delivery of (A) any financial statements other than the
Financial Statements and the Additional Financial Statements, (B) any other
financial information for any period that is not reasonably available to the
Company Entities with respect to such period, (C) any financial information
with respect to a month or fiscal period that has not yet ended or has ended
less than 45 days prior to the date of such request or (D) any authorization
letters, legal opinions or any certificate as to solvency by Seller or any of
the Company Entities. Seller hereby consents to the use of the Company
Entities' logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Company Entities or the reputation or goodwill of any
Company Entity. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5A(ii) or 

elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) in no event shall any Company
Entity be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any fee or incur any
liability or make any commitment or agreement effective in connection with the
Debt Financing prior to the Closing and (y) Buyer affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or to any of its obligations under this Agreement
that Buyer (or the Company Entities) obtain financing for or related to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) Buyer shall promptly upon any request by Seller reimburse Seller for all
reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by Company Entities or any
of their respective Representatives in connection with their compliance with
Section 5A(ii) and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Company
Entities and each of their respective Representatives from and against all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with such compliance, the arrangement of the Debt Financing and
any information used in connection therewith, except to the extent that such
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arose from bad faith, willful
misconduct or gross negligence by any Company Entity with respect to any
historical information provided by any Company Entity in connection with the
Debt Financing.

5B. Ordinary Conduct of Company. From the date of this Agreement through the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article 6, Seller shall cause each of the Company Entities to, except as
contemplated by this Agreement or as consented to by Buyer in writing (which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, delayed or denied),

expenditures substantially in accordance with and in amounts equal to the
amounts set forth in Section 5B of the Seller Disclosure Letter), (ii)
maintain its books, records, and accounts in accordance with past practice as

Financial Statements and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to maintain and

business relationships and the goodwill of its customers and suppliers and
retain the services of its key officers and key employees. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on Section 5B of the
Seller Disclosure Letter or as consented to by Buyer in writing (which
consent, in the cases of clauses (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (i), (k), (l), (m),
(n), (o), (p), (q) and (r) below, shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld, delayed or denied (it being understood that, without limiting other
circumstances where conditioning, withholding or delaying any such consent
shall not be deemed unreasonable, any conditioning, any denial or withholding
of consent with respect to the foregoing shall not be deemed unreasonable if
the action for which consent is sought would require Buyer and/or the Company
Entities to pay, after the Closing, more than $250,000 in excess of the
amounts that would be paid if the action for which the consent is sought was
not otherwise taken or if the action would have similar adverse consequences
to Buyer)), Seller shall cause the Company Entities not to, except as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement:

5C. [RESERVED].

5D. Exclusive Transaction. Seller agrees that from the date hereof and until
the earlier of the Closing Date and the date that this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, except as set forth in Section 5B of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, Seller shall not, and shall cause the Company Entities not
to, and Seller shall instruct its and the Company Entities' respective agents,
officers, directors, employees, controlled affiliates and Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) provide any nonpublic information to any third
party (including via access to any data room or other records) other than
Buyer and its agents and Representatives with respect to any Competing
Transaction, (ii) solicit, initiate or encourage proposals, offers or
inquiries from a third party other than Buyer with respect to any 

Competing Transaction, (iii) participate in any negotiations or discussions
with any third party other than Buyer and its agents and Representatives with
respect to any Competing Transaction or (iv) enter into a letter of intent or
other agreement with a third party other than Buyer with respect to any
Competing Transaction. From and after the execution of this Agreement, Seller
shall promptly (and in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Buyer
of the receipt, directly or indirectly, by Seller or the Company Entities of
any of any of their respective oral or written proposals or inquiries relating
to a Competing Transaction or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Transaction (including any request for nonpublic information in
connection with any potential Competing Transaction) and the material terms
and conditions of any such proposal, inquiry or request and the identity of
the Person making any such proposal, inquiry or request.

5E. 280G Cooperation. Seller will use reasonable efforts to cause the Company
Entities to submit to any applicable stockholder vote before the Closing Date
the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of
the Code) to receive any and all payments and other benefits contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) so that in the event of the
applicable approval, no payment received or which could be received by such
"disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)
of the Code. Before any such submission to stockholders, Seller will cause the
Company Entities to provide disclosure to the applicable stockholders in a
manner intended to comply with the stockholder approval requirements under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such regulations. Within a reasonable
period of time prior to the vote, Buyer and its counsel shall have the right
to review and comment on all documents to be delivered to the stockholders in
connection with such vote and any required disqualified individual waivers or
consents. The parties acknowledge that this Section 5E shall not apply to any
arrangements entered into at the direction of Buyer or between Buyer and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a disqualified individual, on the other hand
("Buyer Arrangements"). In the event that Buyer provides to Seller, no less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a written description
of any Buyer Arrangements, Seller shall cause the Company Entities to include
such description in any materials disclosed to stockholders in connection with
soliciting shareholder approval in accordance with this Section 5E; provided,
however, that compliance with the remainder of this Section 5E shall be
determined as if such Buyer Arrangements had not been entered into. The
parties hereto acknowledge that Seller cannot compel any disqualified
individual to waive any existing rights under a Contract with any Company
Entity and Seller shall not be deemed in breach of this Section 5E with
respect to any disqualified individual who refuses to waive any such right
after Seller has used its reasonable best efforts to obtain such waiver from
such disqualified individual; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, such
reasonable best efforts shall not require Seller or any Company Entity to pay
any additional amounts to such individual.

5F. Letters of Credit. Seller has informed Buyer that the letters of credit,
bank guarantees, performance bonds or similar obligations listed in Section 5F
of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "Letters of Credit") have been issued for
the benefit of the Company Entities. At or prior to the Closing, in order to
facilitate the termination of the Credit Agreement as of the Closing, Buyer
shall either (i) substitute replacement letters of credit for the Letters of
Credit and arrange for return and cancellation of the Letters of Credit
without any additional liability to any Company Entity or (ii) have issued
back-to-back letters of credit or other credit support satisfactory to the
issuer(s) of such Letters of Credit and take such other actions to permit the
cancellation of the Credit Agreement at the Closing.

5G. Press Release and Announcements. Buyer and Seller agree that, on and after
the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or
on behalf of any party without the prior consent of the other party, except
(i) as required by applicable Law or for purposes of compliance with financial
reporting obligations or stock exchange rules and (ii) that each of the
Company Entities may make announcements from time to time to their respective
employees, customers, suppliers 

and other business relations and otherwise as Seller may reasonably determine
is necessary to comply with applicable Law or the requirements of any
agreement to which any Company Entity is a party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release
to be issued on or promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
after the date of this Agreement and a joint press release to be issued on the
Closing Date. Buyer and Seller agree to keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential, except to the extent and to the Persons to whom disclosure is
required by applicable Law or for purposes of compliance with financial
reporting obligations or stock exchange rules; provided, that the parties
hereto may disclose such terms to their respective employees, accountants,
advisors and other Representatives as necessary in connection with the
ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree
to, or are bound by contract to, keep the terms of this Agreement confidential
and so long as the parties shall be responsible to the other parties hereto
for breach of this Section 5G or such confidentiality obligations by the
recipients of its disclosure). Buyer and Seller further acknowledge and agree
that, Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC may disclose such terms and the existence
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to its Affiliates
in order that such Persons may provide information about the subject matter of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective
limited partners and prospective limited partners in connection with their
fundraising and reporting activities.

5H. Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to it
and to any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives by
Seller and its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
(including pursuant to Section 5A) is subject to the terms of that certain
Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement between Seller and Buyer dated as
of July 9, 2014 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are
hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference; provided, that if there
is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control and
govern to the extent of such inconsistency.

5I. Notification. Prior to the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall
promptly notify the other if such Person obtains knowledge that any of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Letter
or the Buyer Disclosure Letter are not true and correct in all material
respects, or if such Person obtains actual knowledge of any material errors
in, or omissions from, this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Letter or the
Buyer Disclosure Letter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at
any time and from time to time after the date hereof until the Closing, the
Company may disclose to Buyer in writing (in the form of one or more updates
to the Seller Disclosure Letter) any development, fact or circumstance
constituting a breach of any of the representations and warranties contained
in Article 3; provided, that no such disclosure or update will be deemed to
amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Letter for purposes of the
conditions to closing set forth in Section 2B(i) or Buyer's ability to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6A(ii).

5J. Consents. The parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable
manner in connection with Buyer or Seller obtaining certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from the parties set forth on
Section 5J of the Seller Disclosure Letter; provided that (i) the receipt of
the consents set forth on Section 5J of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall not
be a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) with regard to those consents to be obtained by Buyer, such
cooperation by Seller shall not include any requirement of Seller or any
Company Entity to expend money, commence any litigation or arbitration
proceeding, waive or surrender any right, modify any agreement (including any
Material Contract) or offer or grant any other accommodation or concession
(financial or otherwise) to any third party or otherwise suffer any detriment,
and (iii) with regard to those consents to be obtained by Seller, such
cooperation by Buyer shall not include any requirement of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to expend money, commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding,
waive or surrender any right, modify any agreement or offer or grant any other
accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any third party or
otherwise suffer any detriment. 

5K. Reasonable Best Efforts.

(i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the limitations set
forth in this Section 5K), each of Buyer and Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its conditions to Closing to be satisfied and for the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and neither Buyer nor Seller shall
take any action designed to prevent, impede or delay the Closing.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of Buyer's obligations under Section
5K(i), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable
and in timely fashion on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (a) maintain
in effect the commitment for the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, (b) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on
the terms and conditions no less favorable in all material respects, to Buyer
than the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" terms and conditions to which the Debt Commitment
Letter is subject), and (c) satisfy (and cause each of its Affiliates to
satisfy), on a timely basis, all conditions to the Debt Financing applicable
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all
conditions contained in the Buyer Debt Documents) that are in Buyer's control.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer's reasonable best
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing shall include obtaining any necessary
consents, waivers or amendments to any of the Buyer Debt Documents that are
necessary to consummate the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated
hereby. In the event that all conditions to the commitment of any counterparty
to the Debt Commitment Letter providing Debt Financing (other than conditions
that are within the control of Buyer) have been satisfied, Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders, and each other Person providing
any Debt Financing, to fund when required hereunder the Debt Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. If any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" terms
and conditions to which the Debt Commitment Letter is subject), or Buyer
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected
to make any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market
flex" terms and conditions to which the Debt Commitment Letter is subject),
then Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources, in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, with terms and
conditions (including "market flex" terms and conditions) not materially less
favorable to Buyer than the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" terms and conditions to which
the Debt Commitment Letter is subject), as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, but in no event later than the date on which
Buyer is required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with this Agreement. Buyer shall not permit an
amendment to the Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter or
engagement letter (or the Buyer Debt Documents) without the prior written
approval of the Seller that would (I) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount), (II) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand,
amend or modify any of the conditions to the Debt Financing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, conditions contained in the Buyer Debt Documents), or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Debt Commitment
Letter or the related fee letters or engagement letters in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay or prevent or make less likely
the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Debt Financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, conditions contained in
the Buyer Debt Documents)) at the Closing or (2) materially adversely impact
the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the Financing Sources or
any other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto (including the Buyer Debt Documents), or (III) make it
less likely that the Debt Financing would be funded (including by making the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, 

conditions contained in the Buyer Debt Documents) less likely to occur) or
otherwise prevent or delay or impair in any material respect the ability or
likelihood of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may modify, supplement or
amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add "Additional Agents" (as defined in the
Debt Commitment Letter) that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter as in effet
on the date hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section
5K(ii), and references to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section
5K(ii). Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and, upon written request, provide to Seller copies (including drafts) of the
material definitive documents for the Debt Financing. Buyer shall give Seller
prompt written and electronic notice of (A) any actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter
or definitive documents related to the Debt Financing of which Buyer becomes
aware, (B) the receipt of any written or electronic notice or other
communication from any lender or other Person providing the Debt Financing
with respect to (x) any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing (or
any statement by any such Person that such Person does not intend to enter
into any such document or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby)
or (y) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the
amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing or any other event or
condition that could reasonably cause a condition to the Debt Financing not to
be satisfied and (C) the occurrence of any event or development that could
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Buyer to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related
to the Debt Financing; provided, that neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to
attorney client or similar privilege, but only if such privilege is asserted
in good faith. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) after the date on which the Company delivers to Buyer a
written request, Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5K(ii) or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer affirms that it is not a condition to the
Closing or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that Buyer (or the
Company Entities) obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5L. Regulatory Act Compliance. Buyer and Seller shall each file or cause to be
filed, promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the
date of this Agreement, any notifications or the like required to be filed
under the HSR Act and with the Antitrust Authorities listed on Section 2A(ii)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. With respect to filings under the HSR Act, Buyer and Seller
shall seek early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and, in
the case of any filing with a Governmental Authority, shall promptly respond
to any requests for additional information made by any agencies. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate with any Governmental Authorities and use all
reasonable best efforts to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement expeditiously and lawfully. To the extent possible, Buyer and Seller
shall each consult with the other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in
person, with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission, the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority, and Buyer and
Seller shall have the right to have a representative present at any such
meeting. Buyer and Seller agree to use their reasonable best efforts to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law that is asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, provided that Buyer shall not have taken any action (or
omitted to take any action) on or after the 

date hereof that would reasonably be expected to result in any impediment
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law being asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to, and
the Seller and its Affiliates shall not, agree in order to obtain the approval
of any Governmental Authority to, (i) institute any litigation or proceeding,
(ii) undertake any sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding
separate arrangement of any products, assets or property of the Company
Entities, (iii) enter into any material modification to or termination of any
material agreement relating to the Business or to the business of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries or (iv) accept any limitation on the ability of the Company
Entities, on the one hand or Buyer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand to
conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted.

5M. Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(i) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
other agreement, from the Closing Date through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of
immediately prior to the Closing) and former officer or director of the
Company Entities (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements (collectively,
"Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to (a) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was an officer or director of the Company Entities or (b) matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent provided for in
the applicable Company Entity's respective certificate of incorporation, by-
laws or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this
Agreement. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (1) each Indemnified Party, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Buyer
or the Company Entities within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by Buyer
from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor, provided that any person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification, (2) neither Buyer nor any Company Entity, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents and (3) Buyer, the Company Entities and
their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

(ii) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Company Entity to, amend,
repeal or modify in a manner adverse to the beneficiary thereof any provision
in such Company Entity's Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation
or indemnification of former officers and directors as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing, it being the intent of the parties that the officers and
directors of the Company Entities prior to the Closing shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law.

(iii) Buyer shall cause the Company Entities to maintain in effect for six (6)
years from the Closing Date directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company Entities'
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms not less
favorable than those of such existing insurance coverage; provided that in the
event that any claim is brought under any such policy prior to the six
(6)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, such directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy shall be maintained until final disposition
thereof. 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Section 5M shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely. In
the event that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or
(b) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, the successors and assigns of Buyer or its
Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall expressly assume and be bound by the
obligations set forth in this Section 5M.

(v) The obligations of Buyer and its Subsidiaries under this Section 5M shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Person to whom this Section 5M applies without the consent of such affected
Person.

5N. Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs. On or before the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide a list of the name and site of employment of any
employee of any Company Entity who has experienced, or will experience, an
employment loss or layoff as defined by the WARN Act within ninety (90) days
prior to the Closing Date. For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, neither Buyer nor any Company Entity shall terminate employees of the
Company Entities except in compliance with the WARN Act. Responsibility for
WARN Act compliance with respect to any employee terminations that occur after
the Closing shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer or the Company Entities.

5O. Employee Benefits Matters. Buyer hereby agrees to assume or cause the
Company Entities to assume, retain, fulfill or discharge any liability or
obligation related to any Company Benefit Plan, including any pension plan,
retiree medical liability, life insurance policy or supplemental retirement
plan. Buyer hereby agrees that, for at least one (1) year following the
Closing Date, Buyer will provide (or cause to be provided) to each employee of
the Company Entities (i) base salary or wages no less favorable than the base
salary or wages provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing
and (ii) other compensation (including bonus opportunity) and employee
benefits that are, in the aggregate with respect to such employee,
substantially comparable to the compensation and employee benefits provided to
such employee immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer hereby agrees that, from
and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company Entities to grant
all employees of the Company Entities credit for any service with the Company
Entities earned prior to the Closing Date (a) for eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual purposes and (b) for purposes of vacation accrual under any
benefit plan, program or arrangement established, continued or maintained by
or on behalf of the Company Entities on or after the Closing Date (the "New
Plans") to the same extent such service was recognized under a similar Company
Benefit Plan, except, in each case, for purposes of any defined benefit
pension or retirement plans or to the extent such treatment would result in
duplicative benefits. In addition, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer shall cause
(1) the Company Entities to waive all pre-existing condition exclusion and
actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the
same extent such conditions were not applicable under any Company Benefit Plan
and (2) any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any
employee (or covered dependent thereof) of the Company Entities to be taken
into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable
New Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after
the Closing, the terms and conditions of employment for any employee of the
Company Entities whose employment is subject to a Collective Bargaining
Agreement shall be governed by such Collective Bargaining Agreement until its
expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5O,
the obligations of Buyer under Section 1G or the rights of any employee under
any Company Benefit Plan or applicable Law, no provision of this Agreement
shall (i) create any right in any employee of the Company Entities to
continued employment by Buyer, any Company Entity, or any respective
subsidiary after the Closing or preclude the ability of Buyer, any Company
Entity, or any respective subsidiary to terminate the employment of any
employee for any reason after the Closing, (ii) require Buyer, any Company
Entity, or any respective Subsidiary to continue any Company Benefit Plans or
prevent the amendment, modification or 

termination thereof after the Closing, (iii) confer upon any employee of the
Company Entities any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement
or (iv) be treated as an amendment to any particular employee benefit plan of
Buyer, any Company Entity, or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided,
that for the avoidance of doubt, no liability or contra-asset shall be
included in the computation of Closing Net Indebtedness or Closing Net Working
Capital as a result of any action taken by or at the written direction of
Buyer with respect to any employee or Company Benefit Plan.

5P. Provisions Respecting Representation of the Company. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, managers, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates,
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to any Seller Party, on the one
hand, and the Company Entities, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland
and Ellis LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to any Seller Party, only
in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to the net indebtedness adjustment and the working capital adjustment
(and the related dispute resolution procedures) provided for in Section 1E
notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Company Entities, and each of the parties hereto (on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives any
conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause
any Affiliate thereof to consent to irrevocably waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation. The parties agree to take the steps
necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Kirkland and
Ellis LLP representing the Company Entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and
shall remain in effect, provided that such privilege from and after the
Closing shall be controlled by Seller. As to any privileged attorney‑client
communications between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and any of the Company Entities
prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "Privileged Communications"),
Buyer and each of the Company Entities together with any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no such party may
use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or
involving any of the parties after the Closing.

5Q. Expenses; Transfer Taxes. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
consummation of the Closing, each party hereto shall pay all fees and expenses
incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise required by applicable Law; provided, that
Buyer shall pay the fees and expenses contemplated to be paid by Buyer
pursuant to Section 5A(iii). If the Closing occurs, (i) Buyer shall pay, or
cause to be paid, all fees and expenses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise required by applicable law, and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall each
pay, or cause to be paid, 50% of any and all transfer, property, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar non-income Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and charges incurred
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5R. Certain Access Provisions.

(i) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
preserve and retain, or cause the Company Entities to preserve and retain and
maintain in an accessible form, all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing or
other books and records of the Company Entities relating to the conduct of the
business and operations of the Company Entities prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that Buyer and Seller shall each preserve, retain and
maintain in an accessible form, or (in the case of Buyer) cause the Company
Entities to preserve and retain, all Tax books and records of the Company
Entities relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the Company
Entities prior to the Closing Date (and in the case of Seller, to the extent
in Seller's possesion on the date hereof and 

as of the Closing Date) until the later of (a) the fifth (5th) anniversary of
the Closing Date and (b) six (6) months after the last date required for
retention of such books and records under applicable Law.

(ii) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company Entities to permit
Seller and its Representatives, and Seller shall permit Buyer, the Company
Entities and their respective Representatives access, during normal business
hours, to, and to inspect and copy (including in electronic form), such
information referred to in this Section 5R and assistance as is reasonably
necessary for any corporate, financial reporting and accounting matters, the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return, the defense of any Tax claim or
assessment, in connection with any disclosure or filing obligation or in
connection with the defense of any Action with a third party.

5S. Certain Tax Matters. Buyer shall not make any election under Section 338
of the Code (or any similar provision under state, local or foreign law) with
respect to the acquisition of the Company Entities.

5T. Additional Financial Information. From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, Seller shall cause the Company Entities to furnish to Buyer, within
forty-five (45) days after the end of each month, copies of the monthly
unaudited consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
operations of August Cayman Intermediate and its Subsidiaries in the form
customarily prepared for the Company Entities.

5U. Name Change. Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Seller
shall take all actions reasonably necessary to change its name, logos and
other trademarks to a name, logos and trademarks that do not contain
"Schrader" or any other trademark owned by any Company Entity. Seller agrees
that from and after the date that it changes its name pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, Seller shall not use the "Schrader" name or
any name likely to be confused with such name. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller may use its name with the designation "f/k/a" for transitional purposes
for up to ninety (90) days subsequent to the Closing.

ARTICLE 6

TERMINATION

6A. Termination. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(i) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

(ii) by Buyer, if (a) Seller has failed to consummate the Closing when
required in accordance with this Agreement or (b) there has been a violation
or breach by Seller of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Buyer at the Closing (and such violation or breach has not been
waived by Buyer) and such violation or breach is not capable of being cured
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier
of (A) ten (10) days after written notice thereof from Buyer and (B) the
Termination Date; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 6A(ii) shall not be available to Buyer at any time that Buyer
has violated, or is in breach of, any covenant, representation or warranty
hereunder, if such breach has prevented satisfaction of any of Seller's
conditions to Closing hereunder (and has not been waived by Seller) or, if
capable of being cured, has not been cured by Buyer;

(iii) by Seller, if (a) Buyer has failed to consummate the Closing when
required in accordance with this Agreement or (b) there has been a violation
or breach by Buyer of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Seller at the Closing (and such violation or breach has not
been waived by Seller) and such violation or breach is not capable of 

being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to
the earlier of (A) ten (10) days after written notice thereof from Seller and
(B) the Termination Date; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6A(iii) shall not be available to Seller at any time
that Seller has violated, or is in breach of, any covenant, representation or
warranty hereunder if such breach has prevented satisfaction of Buyer's
conditions to Closing hereunder (and has not been waived by Buyer) or, if
capable of being cured, has not been cured by Seller;

(iv) by Buyer or Seller, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
have not been consummated prior to November 14, 2014; provided, that if the
conditions set forth in Section 2A(i), Section 2A(ii), Section 2B(vi) or
Section 2C(v) shall not have been satisfied on or prior to November 13, 2014,
but all other conditions in Article 2 have been satisfied or waived as of such
date or, in the case of conditions that have not been validly waived in
accordance with this Agreement which by their terms or nature are to be
satisfied as of the Closing Date, are reasonably capable of being satisfied if
such date was the Closing Date, then either party hereto may extend the
Termination Date to a date not later than December 30, 2014 upon provision of
a certificate executed by an executive officer of such party that such party
believes in good faith that the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 2A(i), Section 2A(ii), Section 2B(vi) or Section 2C(v) are capable of
being satisfied prior to December 30, 2014 (such date as may be further
extended pursuant to Section 8P(i), the "Termination Date"); provided,
further, that (a) Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6A(iv) if Buyer's breach of this Agreement (including
in each case if Buyer failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement when required in accordance with Section 1C) has prevented the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) Seller shall not
be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6A(iv) if
Seller's breach of this Agreement (including in each case if Seller failed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement when required in
accordance with Section 1C) has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

(v) by Buyer or Seller, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken
any other action, in each case permanently restraining, permanently enjoining
or otherwise permanently prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
non−appealable.

6B. Effect of Termination.

(i) In the event of any termination of this Agreement by Buyer or Seller as
provided in Section 6A, (a) this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of
no further force or effect (except that this Section 6B and Section 5A(iii),
Section 5H, Section 5P, Section 5Q and Article 8 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto) and (b)
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer or Seller to
any other party hereto with respect to this Agreement; provided, that,
notwithstanding clause (b) of this Section 6B(i), (1) liability may exist for
breach of, or otherwise with respect to, the provisions of this Agreement
specified in the parenthetical contained in clause (a) of this Section 6B(i),
(2) Buyer shall remain liable for payment of the Termination Fee and other
liabilities as provided in Section 6B(ii) and (3) subject to any applicable
limitations in Section 6B(ii), each party hereto shall remain liable for any
willful and material breach by such party of any covenant or agreement of such
party contained in this Agreement.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (a) by Seller pursuant to
Section 6A(iii)(a), (b) by Seller pursuant to Section 6A(iii)(b) after the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date hereof, (c) by Seller or Buyer pursuant to
Section 6A(iv) either (x) at a time when Seller may terminate this Agreement
in accordance with Section 6(a)(iii) or (y) at a time when all conditions to
the Closing set forth in Section 2A and Section 2B have been satisfied or
waived (other than (1) the conditions set forth in Section 2A(i), Section
2A(ii) or Section 2A(iii) and (2) those conditions that have not been validly
waived in accordance with this Agreement which by their terms or their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided such conditions referred to in
this clause (2) are reasonably capable of being satisfied 

if the date of termination were the Closing Date) or (d) by Buyer or Seller
pursuant to Section 6A(v), then within two (2) Business Days following such
termination, Buyer shall pay $45,000,000.00 (the "Termination Fee") to Seller,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud, termination of
this Agreement and payment of the Termination Fee by Buyer when payable
pursuant to this Section 6B(ii), together with reimbursement of all applicable
expenses pursuant to this Section 6B(ii), in each case, by Buyer shall be
Seller's and its Affiliates' sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Buyer, its Affiliates', the
Financing Sources and their respective Representatives and assignees for any
breach, loss or damage, and none of Buyer, its Affiliates, the Financing
Sources or their respective Representatives or assignees will have any
liability or obligation to Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory of
law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; provided, that nothing in this Section 6B(ii)
shall limit the right of Seller or any other Seller Party (x) to bring or
maintain any Action for injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief as provided in Section 8P or (y) to bring or maintain any Action
against Buyer or any other Buyer Party arising out of or in connection with
any breach of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Financing Sources (and such
Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors and Representatives) are express third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6B. Each of parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 6B(ii) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into this
Agreement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that (A) Buyer and Seller
have expressly negotiated the provisions of this Section 6B(ii), (B) in light
of the circumstances existing at the time of the execution of this Agreement
(including the inability of the parties hereto to quantify the damages that
may be suffered by Seller) the provisions of this Section 6B(ii) are
reasonable, (C) the Termination Fee represents a good faith, fair estimate of
the damages that Seller would suffer and (D) the Termination Fee shall be
payable as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) without requiring Seller
or any other Person to prove actual damages. In the event that Buyer shall
fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all
costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Seller (including fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with collection under and enforcement in
full of this Section 6B(ii), together with interest on such amount at a rate
per annum equal to the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made (as published by The Wall
Street Journal) through the date such payment was actually received. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Buyer Parties
or any of them be required to pay, or cause to be paid, the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

ARTICLE 8

MISCELLANEOUS

8A. No Survival; Certain Waivers.

(i) The representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller
(other than covenants of Seller contained in Section 1D) to the extent
contemplating or requiring complete performance prior to 

the Closing, set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 1D, shall not survive the Closing. Each of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement, or in
any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement, shall terminate
effective immediately as of the Closing such that no claim for breach of any
such representation or warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy
(whether in contract, in tort or at law or in equity) may be brought after the
Closing with respect thereto against Seller or any other Seller Party. The
covenants and agreements of Seller set forth in this Agreement and in any
other document delivered in connection herewith to the extent contemplating or
requiring performance by Seller prior to the Closing (other than covenants and
agreements contained in Section 1D) shall terminate effective immediately as
of the Closing such that no claim for breach of any such covenant, detrimental
reliance or other right or remedy (whether in contract, in tort, at law or in
equity) may be brought after the Closing with respect thereto against Seller
or any other Seller Party. Each covenant and agreement of Seller set forth in
Section 1D, and each covenant or agreement of Seller requiring performance at
or after the Closing, shall, in each case, expressly survive the Closing, and
nothing in this Section 8A(i) shall be deemed to limit any rights or remedies
of Buyer for breach of any such surviving covenant or agreement.

(ii) Buyer, for itself and on behalf of the other Buyer Parties (including,
after the Closing, the Company Entities), acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
(including under Environmental Law), any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have against any Seller Party relating to the operation of the
Company Entities or their respective businesses or relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Letter, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, whether arising under, or based upon, any
federal, state, local or foreign statute, law (including common law),
ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (including any right, whether
arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost
recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy, including as may arise
under common law) are hereby irrevocably waived. Furthermore, without limiting
the generality of this Section 8A, (a) no claim shall be brought or maintained
by, or on behalf of, Buyer or any other Buyer Party (including, after the
Closing, the Company Entities) against any Seller Party, and no recourse shall
be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any
alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller or any other Person set
forth or contained in this Agreement, any certificate, instrument, opinion,
agreement or other document of Seller or any other Person delivered hereunder,
the subject matter of this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Letter and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the business, the ownership,
operation, management, use or control of the business of any of the Company
Entities, any of their assets, or any actions or omissions at, or prior to,
the Closing, (b) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of their
respective Representatives has made, or is making (and neither Buyer nor any
other Buyer Party is relying or has relied on) any statement, representation
or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, except for the representations and
warranties expressly provided in this Agreement (including Article 3), in any
Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder or thereunder,
and (c) no Seller Party, nor any of their respective direct or indirect
Affiliates nor any of their respective Representatives, will have or be
subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's use of, any information, document or
material made available to Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective
counsel, accountants, consultants, advisors, agents or other representatives
in certain "data rooms" and online "data sites," management presentations,
management interviews or any other form in expectation or anticipation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than liability with respect
to breaches of the representations and warranties expressly provided in this
Agreement (including Article 3)).

(iii) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
Section 8A are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements set forth in this Section 8A,
Seller would not enter into this Agreement or otherwise agree to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

(iv) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8A or
otherwise shall limit Buyer's right to bring any claim or cause of action
based upon (x) actual fraud by Seller in the making of the representations and
warranties made in this Agreement or the certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 2B(iv) or (y) breach of the representations and warranties made in the
third sentence of Section 3F (Capitalization) or in the fourth sentence of
Section 3F (Capitalization) (but in the case of the fourth sentence, only to
the extent breached with respect to the Company (and not any other Company
Entity)).

8B. Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or any provision of
this Agreement may be waived; provided that (i) any amendment or waiver shall
be binding only if such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed
by Buyer and Seller and (ii) subject to Section 2D with respect to the waiver
of conditions to Closing as of the Closing, any waiver of any provision of
this Agreement shall be effective against Buyer or Seller only if set forth in
a writing executed by such Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Section 6B, this Section 8B, Section 8D, Section 8H, Section
8L, Section 8M, Section 8O and Section 8S (and any provision of this Agreement
to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provision would
modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may not be modified,
waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to
the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest
in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any
part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by
reason of this Agreement.

8C. Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in

negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding
of the parties hereto and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed
to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises with respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the
execution version of this Agreement shall control and prior drafts of this

Seller Disclosure Letter and the Buyer Disclosure Letter are for convenience
of reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not
be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this

8I. Seller Disclosure Letter. Any matter disclosed on any section or
subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed on
any other section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter only to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection. The inclusion of
information in the Seller Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as, and
shall not constitute, an admission or agreement that a violation, right of
termination, default, liability or other obligation of any kind exists with
respect to any item, nor shall it be construed as or constitute an admission
or agreement that such information is material to any of the Company Entities.

similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Letter is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no Person shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Seller Disclosure Letter is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

specified herein (with time being of the essence).

8O. Third-Party Beneficiaries and Obligations. This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights,
remedies or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other than
sections which are specifically for the benefit of Seller Parties, the
officers, directors and employees of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and
Persons to which Company Expenses are owed, as applicable (including under
Section 5A(iii), Section 5M, Section 5Q, Section 5R, Section 8A(ii) and this
Section 8O), the Financing Sources (under Section 6B, Section 8B, Section 8D,
Section 8L, Section 8M, Section 8O and Section 8S), each of which is intended
to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or to be paid thereunder
and may be enforced by such Persons. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries shall not arise unless and until the
Closing occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with this Agreement
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

8P. Specific Performance.

(i) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto
fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 8P, (a) the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 8L without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in Section 6B are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and
shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
party's right to specific performance or other equitable relief and (c) the
right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or
other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary 

damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 8P shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
If, on or prior to the Termination Date, any party hereto brings any action,
in each case in accordance with Section 8L, to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended (1) for the period during
which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (2) by such other
time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case
may be. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall
this Section 8P be used, alone or together with any other provision of this
Agreement, to require Seller to remedy any breach of any representation or
warranty of Seller made herein.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be entitled to any injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to enforce specifically the obligation of Buyer to consummate
the Closing unless (a) all of the conditions set forth in Section 2A and
Section 2B have been satisfied (other than those conditions that have not been
validly waived in accordance with this Agreement which by their terms or
nature are to be satisfied by performance at the Closing so long as such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were
the date on which Seller is seeking specific performance), (b) Buyer has
failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1C, (c) the proceeds
of the Debt Financing have been funded or will be funded subject to
satisfaction of any equity funding condition in the Debt Commitment Letter,
and (d) Seller has not terminated this Agreement in accordance with Article 6
and has given Buyer written notice irrevocably confirming that if the Debt
Financing were to be funded and any equity funding condition in the Debt
Commitment Letter were to be satisfied, then Seller will consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8Q. Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties hereto will take
such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as the other party hereto may reasonably request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party hereto.

8R. No Partnership Created. Nothing in this Agreement (including Section 5B)
is intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company Entities' operations prior to the Closing and, without
limiting its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall exercise complete
control over its and the Company Entities' operations. Furthermore, in no
event shall this Agreement be deemed to create a partnership between Seller or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, and in no event shall any fiduciary or similar duty be deemed
owed by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

8S. No Recourse; Waiver of Claims. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its shareholders,
partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Debt
Commitment Letter, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its shareholders,
partners, members, Affiliates, directors, offices, employees, agents and
representatives) agrees not to commence an Action against any Financing Source
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder
(including any Action relating to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment
Letter). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is
agreed that no Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims,
losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties
to the Company (or any of its shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder. Nothing in this 

Section 8S shall in any way (a) expand the circumstances in which Buyer may be
liable under this Agreement or as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including as a result of the Debt Financing) or (b) limit or qualify
the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
to each other thereunder or in connection therewith.

8T. Parent Guaranty.

(i) Subject to any limitations as may exist on Buyer's obligations hereunder,
Parent hereby irrevocably guarantees, absolutely and unconditionally, to
Seller the full and complete performance by Buyer of its obligations under
this Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of Buyer under this Agreement. Parent shall
cause Buyer to perform all of its agreements, covenants and obligations under
this Agreement on a timely basis. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment,
demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any
proceeding first against Seller, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in
connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section
8T or elsewhere in this Agreement.

(ii) Parent hereby represents and warrants to Seller that (a) the execution,
delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement are within Parent's legal
right, power and authority, (b) no other action on the part of Parent is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
or the performance of its obligations hereunder, (c) this Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Parent and constitutes a valid and legally
binding obligation of Parent, enforceable in accordance with its terms and
conditions, and (d) the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (1) result
in any violation of any judgment, injunction, ruling, order, charge or decree
entered with respect to Parent, (2) result in any material violation of any
Law or material license or permit applicable to Parent by Parent, or (3)
require any material authorization, consent, approval, exemption or other
action of or by or notice declaration to, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority or other Person by Parent.
