CONVERSION OF SHARES   

 3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of IBC, Acquisition Sub, LFC or any holder of capital stock of LFC:   

 (a) Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of Acquisition Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.     ##### 

    

 (b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and IBC Owned Shares. All shares of common stock of LFC, par value $.01 per share (the "Shares"), that are owned directly or indirectly by LFC as treasury stock or by any wholly owned subsidiary of LFC (other than Shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) and any Shares owned by IBC, Acquisition Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of IBC shall be canceled and cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   

 (c) Conversion of Shares.   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) Subject to other applicable provisions of this
Agreement, including Section 3.2, each issued and outstanding Share (other
than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and
Dissenters Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof, either: (A) a number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of IBC ("IBC
Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Per Share
Stock Consideration"), or (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration. As used
herein, the following terms have the respective meanings set forth below:  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | "Exchange Ratio" means the Per Share Merger Consideration divided
by the IBC Common Stock Value.  
     
     | "Per Share Merger Consideration" means $22.00; provided, however,
that if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to August 15,
2004, then the "Per Share Merger Consideration" shall mean the sum of (x)
$22.00 plus (y) the Per Share Adjustment Amount.  
     
     | "Per Share Adjustment Amount" means an amount equal to
the quotient of (x) the Aggregate Adjustment Amount divided by (y) the sum
of (1) the aggregate number of Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time plus (2) the aggregate number of Shares issuable
with respect to the LFC Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, assuming for purposes of this calculation that all
outstanding LFC Stock Options are immediately exercisable and fully vested.  
     
     | "Aggregate Adjustment Amount" means an amount equal to the product
of (x) $76,667 multiplied by (y) the number of days in the period commencing
on August 16, 2004, and ending on the date on which the Effective Time occurs
(including, for purposes of such calculation, August 16, 2004, and the
date on which the Effective Time occurs)  
     
     | "IBC Common Stock Value" means the average of the closing sale
prices for a share of IBC Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock
Market, Inc. National Market System (as reported by The Wall Street Journal,
or, if not reported thereby, as reported by any other authoritative
source) during the ten (10) consecutive Business Days beginning fifteen (15)
Business Days before the Effective Time (the "Determination  ##### 

     

      |   
---|--- 
     | Period"); provided, however, that (i) if the IBC Common
Stock Value as otherwise determined pursuant to the preceding provisions of
this sentence would be less than $46.00, then the IBC Common Stock Value
shall be $46.00, and (ii) if the IBC Common Stock Value as otherwise
determined pursuant to the preceding provisions of this sentence would be
greater than $56.00, then the IBC Common Stock Value shall be $56.00. The
Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to the nearest one-ten-thousandth of a
share of IBC Common Stock.  
     
     | "Merger Consideration" means the aggregate Per Share
Cash Consideration and the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration into
which all outstanding Shares are converted pursuant to this Section 3.1(c);
provided, however, that the term "Merger Consideration" when used with
respect to any Shares, holder(s) of Shares, and/or Certificate(s)
representing Shares means the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and/or
Per Share Stock Consideration into which such Shares are converted pursuant
to this Section 3.1(c).  
     
     | "Per Share Cash Consideration" means an amount in cash equal to
the Per Share Merger Consideration.  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (ii) _ Anti-Dilution Adjustments. _Should IBC change (or
establish a record date for changing) the number of shares of IBC Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by way
of a split, dividend, combination, recapitalization, exchange of shares
or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding IBC Common
Stock having a record date preceding the Effective Time of the Merger, then,
to the extent necessary to provide to the holders of Shares the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
split, dividend, combination, recapitalization, exchange of shares or
similar transaction, the IBC Common Stock Value (or the prices for the IBC
Common Stock used in determining the IBC Common Stock Value) shall
be appropriately adjusted.  
     
     | (iii) _ Fractional Shares. _Fractional shares shall not be
issued under this Subsection (c), or otherwise, and any amount
otherwise attributable to fractional shares shall be paid in cash in an
amount equal to the product of the IBC Common Stock Value multiplied by
the fraction of a share of IBC Common Stock that would otherwise have
been issued, rounded to the nearest whole cent.  
  

 3.2 Election and Allocation Procedures.   

 (a) Subject to the allocation procedures set forth in Subsection 3.2(b), each record holder of Shares will be entitled (i) to elect (a "Stock Election") to receive shares of IBC Common Stock for all of the Shares ("Stock Election Shares") held by such record holder, (ii) to elect (a "Cash Election") to receive cash for all of the Shares ("Cash Election Shares") held by such record holder; or (iii) to elect (a "Mixed Election") to receive part shares of IBC Common Stock (such portion of the Shares attributable to the election to receive shares being included in Stock Election Shares) and part cash (such portion of the Shares attributable to the election to    ##### 

    

receive cash being included in Cash Election Shares) for his, her or
its Shares; or (iv) to indicate (a "Non-Election") that such holder makes no
such election for all of the Shares ("No-Election Shares") held by such
record holder, provided, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the number of Shares to be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration in the Merger (the "Stock Number") will
equal as nearly as possible the product of (i) 25% multiplied by (ii) the
total number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger (excluding Shares to be canceled as provided in Section 3.1(b) but
including Dissenters Shares). All such elections (each, an "Election") shall
be made on an Election Form. Any Shares for which the record holder has not,
as of the Election Deadline, properly submitted to IBC or the Exchange Agent
a properly completed Election Form (excluding any Dissenters Shares) will be
deemed No-Election Shares. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
herein, all Dissenters Shares will be deemed Cash Election Shares.  

 (b) The allocation among the holders of Shares of rights to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Merger will be made as follows:   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (i) _ Number of Stock Election Shares Less Than 25%_. If the
number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received as
of the Election Deadline) is less than 25% of the number of issued
and outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, then (1)
each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of the
Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration; (2) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the No-
Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of No-Election Shares in accordance
with their respective numbers of No-Election Shares, a sufficient number
of No-Election Shares so that the sum of such number and the number of
Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable, but not less than,
25% of the Shares, and each such allocated No-Election Share (each,
a "Stock-Selected No-Election Share") will be, as of the Effective Time
of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration, provided that if the sum of all No-Election Shares
and Stock Election Shares is less than or equal to 25% of the Shares,
all No-Election Shares will be Stock-Selected No-Election Shares; (3) if
the sum of Stock Election Shares and No-Election Shares is less than 25%
of the Shares, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Cash
Election Shares (other than Dissenters Shares, which shall in no event be
deemed to be or treated as Converted Cash Election Shares), pro rata to
the holders of such Cash Election Shares in accordance with their
respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of such
Cash Election Shares so that the sum of such number, the number of all
Stock Election Shares and the number of all No-Election Shares equals
as closely as practicable, but not less than, 25% of the Shares, and
each such allocated Cash Election Share (each, a "Converted Cash
Election Share") will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and (4)
each No-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is not a Stock-
Selected No-Election Share or a Converted Cash Election Share (as the case
may be) will be, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; or  
     
     | (ii) _ Number of Stock Election Shares Greater Than or Equal
to 25%_. If the number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election
Forms received by the Election Deadline) is greater than or equal to 25% of
the issued and outstanding Shares  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | immediately prior to the Effective Time, then (1) each Cash
Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time of
the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration; and (2) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among
the Stock Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Stock Election
Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Stock Election Shares,
a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares so that the sum of such
number and the number of Cash Election Shares and No-Election Shares equals
as closely as practicable 75% of the Shares, and each such allocated Stock-
Election Share (each, a "Converted Stock Election Share") will be, as of the
Effective Time of the Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration. The remaining Stock Election Shares (which are not
Converted Stock Election Shares) will be, as of the Effective Time of the
Merger, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.  
  

 (c) An election form (an "Election Form") and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing Shares ("Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to a bank or trust company designated by IBC and reasonably satisfactory to LFC (the "Exchange Agent") in such form as LFC and IBC shall mutually agree shall be mailed on the Mailing Date to each holder of record of Shares as of a record date (the "Election Form Record Date") five (5) Business Days prior to the Mailing Date. The "Mailing Date" shall be a date to be mutually agreed upon by IBC and LFC that is at least thirty five (35) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time (or such other date as IBC and LFC may mutually agree). LFC shall make available one or more Election Forms as may be reasonably requested by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Shares after the Election Form Record Date and prior to the Election Deadline, and LFC shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as specified herein.   

 (d) Each Election Form shall entitle the holder of Shares (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to make either a Stock Election, Cash Election, Mixed Election or Non-Election. Holders of record of Shares who hold such Shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a "Representative") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that such Representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all the Shares held by that Representative for a particular beneficial owner.   

 (e) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is thirty (30) days after the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as LFC and IBC may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline"). An election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by IBC pursuant to Section 3.3(i), indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all Shares covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. Any LFC stockholder may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change his or her election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Election Form. Any LFC stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election    ##### 

    

Deadline, revoke his or her election by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to
the Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent.
All elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is
notified in writing by IBC and LFC that this Agreement has been terminated.
If a stockholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline, or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline and does not submit a new properly executed Election Form
prior to the Election Deadline, the Shares held by such stockholder shall be
designated No-Election Shares. IBC shall cause the Certificates representing
Shares described in (ii) to be promptly returned without charge to the
Person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from
the Person who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election
Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive.  

 3.3 Exchange Procedures.   

 (a) Appropriate transmittal materials ("Letter of Transmittal") in a form satisfactory to IBC and LFC shall be mailed within three Business Days after the Effective Time to each holder of record of Shares as of the Effective Time who did not previously submit a completed Election Form. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by certificates representing all Shares to be converted thereby.   

 (b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto.   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, IBC shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and the aggregate amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1, and IBC shall reserve for issuance with its transfer agent and registrar a sufficient number of shares of IBC Common Stock to provide for payment of the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration.   

 (d) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and contain any other provisions as IBC may reasonably determine and (iii) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (m) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of IBC Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, if any, and (n) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, if any (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 3.3.    ##### 

    

Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As soon
as practicable following receipt of the properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent
shall distribute IBC Common Stock and cash as provided herein. The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the shares of IBC Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account
of the Persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of ownership of any
Shares not registered in the transfer records of LFC, the Merger
Consideration shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the Certificates
representing such Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of IBC and the Exchange
Agent, (x) to evidence and effect such transfer and (y) to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. The Merger Consideration and
any additional amounts paid upon the surrender for exchange of certificates
representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares theretofore represented by such certificates.  

 (e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to IBC Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of IBC Common Stock hereunder until such Person surrenders his or her Certificates in accordance with this Section 3.3. Upon the surrender of such Persons Certificates, such Person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent to the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares of IBC Common Stock represented by such Persons Certificates.   

 (f) The stock transfer books of LFC shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of LFC of any Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to IBC, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.3.   

 (g) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1, any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.3 or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of LFC for six months after the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to IBC upon the written request of IBC. After such request is made, any stockholders of LFC who have not theretofore complied with this Section 3.3 shall look only to IBC for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Shares such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Article III of this Agreement, without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date on which such payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by any abandoned property, escheat or other applicable laws, become the property of IBC (and, to the extent not in its possession, shall be paid over to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.     ##### 

    

 (h) IBC and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon LFCs stock transfer books to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, IBC and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.   

 (i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent of IBC, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article III.   

 3.4 Dissenters Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who properly shall have demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenters Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, except that all Dissenters Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 3.3 of the Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced such Shares. LFC shall give IBC (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by LFC relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of LFC thereunder. LFC shall not, except with the prior written consent of IBC, (x) make any payment with respect to such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any demand for appraisal or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.   

 3.5 Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either of the constituent corporations to the Merger or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its appropriate officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the constituent corporations to the Merger, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in    ##### 

    

the name and on behalf of such constituent corporations, all such other acts
and things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm
its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges,
powers, franchises, properties or assets of such constituent corporation and
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.  

 3.6 Withholding Taxes. IBC and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by IBC or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by IBC or the Surviving Corporation, and IBC shall provide, or cause the Exchange Agent to provide, to the holders of such Certificates written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld.   

 3.7 Subsidiary Mergers. LFC shall take, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to take, in advance of the Effective Time, any action requested by IBC to facilitate the merger (the "Holding Company Merger") of LFC into IBC and the merger (the "Bank Merger" and, together with the Holding Company Merger, the "Subsidiary Mergers") of Local Oklahoma Bank, an Oklahoma banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of LFC ("LFC Bank"), into International Bank of Commerce, Laredo, Texas, a Texas banking association and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of IBC ("IBC Bank"), including execution and delivery of any required or appropriate regulatory filings, Articles of Merger, Certificates of Merger, any requested certificates of officers, and such other documents as may be required to cause such mergers to become effective immediately following the Effective Time.   

 3.8 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, IBC may specify that the structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be revised and the parties shall enter into such alternative transactions as IBC may determine to effect the purposes of this Agreement, subject to the prior written consent of LFC, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that such revised structure shall not (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely change the intended federal income tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) materially impede, delay, or reduce the likelihood of, the receipt of any regulatory approval referred to in, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. The parties agree to enter into such amendments of this Agreement and any related documents, and to take such other actions, as IBC may request to reflect any such revised structure.

 (a) Organization and Operation of LFC. LFC is a Delaware corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware, and, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on LFC, has the full power and authority (including all licenses, franchises, permits and other governmental authorizations which are legally required) to own its properties and to engage in the business and activities now conducted by it.

To the knowledge of LFC, there is no reason to believe that the existing fidelity coverage would not be renewed by its carrier on substantially the same terms unless such failure to renew is based upon any pending claim.   

 (x) Leases, Contracts and Agreements. Section 4.1(x) of the LFC Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of all leases, subleases, licenses, contracts and agreements to which LFC or any LFC Subsidiary is a party or by which LFC or any LFC Subsidiary is bound which obligate or may obligate LFC or any LFC Subsidiary for an amount in excess of $100,000 over the entire term of any such agreement or related contracts of a similar nature which in the aggregate obligate or may obligate LFC or any LFC Subsidiary in the aggregate for an amount in excess of $100,000 over the entire term of such related contracts (the "Contracts").

To the knowledge of LFC, all of the Contracts are legal, valid and binding obligations of the parties to the Contracts enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws relating to creditors rights generally and to general equitable principles, and are in full force and effect. To the knowledge of LFC, except as described in Section 4.1(x) of the LFC Disclosure Schedule, all rent and other payments by LFC and any LFC Subsidiary under the Contracts are current, except for defaults which would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on LFC, there are no existing defaults by LFC or any LFC Subsidiary under the     #####

Subsidiary has a good and valid leasehold interest in each parcel of real
property leased by it free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens,

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   

 6.1 LFC Stockholders Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Statement.   

 (a) LFC shall, as promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "LFC Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required LFC Vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall take all lawful action to solicit the approval of this Agreement by the Required LFC Vote and the Board of Directors of LFC shall recommend approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of LFC, provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of LFC from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation if the Board of Directors of LFC determines, after consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is legally required in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable law.   

 (b) IBC and LFC shall cooperate in preparing, and LFC shall cause to be filed with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, mutually acceptable proxy materials which shall constitute the proxy statement-prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the LFC stockholders at the LFC Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement-prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus"), and IBC shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of IBC Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Registration Statement"). The Proxy Statement-Prospectus will be included as a prospectus in and will constitute a part of the Registration Statement as IBCs prospectus. Each of IBC and LFC shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement-Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. IBC and LFC shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any written     ##### 

    

comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, received from the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or Registration Statement.
The parties shall cooperate and provide the other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and the Registration Statement prior to
filing such with the SEC, and will provide each other with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by
reference) to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement
shall be made without the approval of both parties, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that with respect to documents
filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement or Proxy Statement-Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply
only with respect to information relating to the other party or its business,
financial condition or results of operations. LFC will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed to LFCs
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the 1933 Act. Each party will advise the other
party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of the IBC Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the
Registration Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to IBC or LFC, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by IBC or LFC which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement-Prospectus so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the stockholders of LFC.  

 (c) IBC shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and each of LFC and IBC shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of LFC Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.   

 (d) IBC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of IBC Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. National Market System, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.   

 6.2 Access to Information and Confidentiality.   

 (a) Upon reasonable notice, LFC and IBC shall each (and shall each cause its Subsidiaries to) use its commercially reasonable efforts to afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of the other party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, documents, employees, vendors, suppliers and service providers, and all other information with respect to their business affairs, financial condition, assets and liabilities, and, during such period, LFC and IBC shall each (and shall each     ##### 

    

cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed, published, announced or received by it during such period pursuant to
the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, as applicable (other
than documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable
law), and (b) consistent with its legal obligations, all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request. LFC and IBC shall each permit the other party, its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives to make copies of such books, records and other documents and
to discuss its business affairs, condition (financial and otherwise),
operations, assets and liabilities with such third Persons, including,
without limitation, its directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
creditors, vendors, suppliers and service providers, as the other party
considers necessary or appropriate for any purpose, including, without
limitation, familiarizing itself with its businesses and operations,
obtaining any necessary orders, consents or approvals of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, conducting an evaluation of its assets and
liabilities and facilitating the integration of the business and operations
of LFC and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. LFC and IBC will each
cause its outside accountants to make available to the other party, its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisor and other
representatives, such personnel, work papers and other documentation of such
firm relating to its work papers and its audits of the books and records of
such party as may be requested by the other party in connection with its
review of the foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, during the period of time beginning on the date of this Agreement
and continuing to the Effective Time, LFC shall promptly provide (and in any
case within one week after the relevant meeting) complete and accurate
minutes of all meetings of the Board of Directors (or any committee of the
Board of Directors) of LFC and/or any LFC Subsidiary.  

 (b) IBC and LFC shall each, and shall each cause its affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the 1934 Act) and its and their employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel and other representatives and advisers to, hold in strict confidence all, and not divulge or disclose any information of any kind concerning the other party and its business; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation of confidence shall not apply to (i) information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such party, any of its affiliates or any of its employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel or other representatives or advisers, (ii) information that is or becomes available to such party, any of its affiliates or any of its employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel or other representatives or advisers on a nonconfidential basis, and (iii) information that is required to be disclosed by such party, any of its affiliates or any of its employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel or other representatives or advisers as a result of any applicable law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity; and provided further, however, that each party shall promptly notify the other party of any disclosure by it pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 6.2(b). Promptly after any termination of this Agreement, each party and its representatives shall return to the other party or destroy all copies of documentation with respect to the other party that were supplied by or on behalf of such party pursuant to this Agreement, without retaining any copy thereof, and destroy any notes or analyses such party and/or its representatives may have prepared containing information derived from such materials     ##### 

    

 6.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreements each party will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including, without limitation, obtaining the LFC Required Consents and the IBC Required Consents in a timely manner. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make any appropriate filings pursuant to the BHC Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the BHC Act and to take all other actions reasonably necessary to cause the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby under the BHC Act and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the BHC Act as soon as practicable. Nothing in this Section 6.3(a) shall require any of IBC and its Subsidiaries to sell or otherwise dispose of, or permit the sale or other disposition of, any assets of IBC, LFC or their respective Subsidiaries, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from a Governmental Entity or any other Person or for any other reason.   

 (b) Each of IBC and LFC shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.3(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger and the Subsidiary Mergers) under the BHC Act or any other applicable law or regulation, use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make all appropriate filings and submissions with any Governmental Entity that may be necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws or regulations in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any such filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (iii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to the Federal Reserve Board or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the Federal Reserve Board or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the Federal Reserve Board or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.   

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(b), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any applicable law or regulation, each of IBC and LFC shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use all commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation     ##### 

    

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this
Section 6.3 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1 so long as such party has up to then complied in all respects
with its obligations under this Section 6.3.  

 (d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable law or regulation or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable law or regulation, each of IBC and LFC shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such law or regulation so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 6.4 Acquisition Proposals. LFC shall not directly or indirectly, and it shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents or affiliates, including any investment bankers, attorneys or accountants retained by LFC or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, not to, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal or offer for a merger, recapitalization, consolidation, business combination, sale of a substantial portion of the assets of LFC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, sale of 15% or more of the shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer, share exchange or exchange offer) or similar or comparable transactions involving LFC or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such proposal or offer (other than a proposal or offer made by IBC or an affiliate thereof) being herein referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"), or (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of LFC may, at any time prior to approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of LFC, furnish information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to, or engage in discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal of such Person if, (a) LFC has not violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.4, (b) the Board of Directors of LFC or any committee thereof concludes in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary in order for the Board of Directors of LFC to comply with its fiduciary obligation to the stockholders of LFC under applicable law and (c) only to the extent that, the Board of Directors of LFC determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. From and after the execution of this Agreement, LFC shall immediately advise IBC in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations or proposals relating to an Acquisition Proposal (including the specific terms thereof and the identity of the other party or parties involved) and furnish to IBC within 24 hours of such receipt an accurate description of all material terms (including any changes or adjustments to such terms as a result of negotiations or otherwise) of any such written proposal in addition to any information provided to any third party relating thereto. Upon execution of this Agreement, LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, LFCs Board of     ##### 

    

Directors shall be permitted, at any time prior to the approval of
this Agreement by the stockholders of LFC, (i) to withdraw, modify or change,
or propose to withdraw, modify or change, the approval or recommendation by
the Board of Directors of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) to approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, but only if, in
each case referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), the Board of Directors of LFC
concludes in good faith that (a) such Acquisition Proposal would, if
consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal and such proposal has not been
withdrawn and (b) in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure to
withdraw, withhold, amend, modify or change such recommendation would
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of LFC
to the stockholders of LFC under applicable law. LFC shall immediately advise
IBC in writing, if the Board of Directors shall make any determination as to
any Acquisition Proposal as contemplated by the preceding sentence. Nothing
contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit LFC or its Board of Directors
(i) from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act or from making
any legally required disclosure to the stockholders of LFC with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) prior to the approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of LFC, from taking any action as contemplated by Section
8.1(f).  

 6.5 Treatment of LFC Stock Options; Other Stock Plans; Employee Benefits Matters.   

 (a) Stock Options. The treatment of the LFC Stock Options in the Merger shall be as follows:   

 (i) As to all LFC Stock Options represented by agreements not expressly requiring the Surviving Corporation, IBC or any of the IBC Subsidiaries to assume such LFC Stock Options or to substitute equivalent options ("Terminating Options"), such Terminating Options shall terminate and be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the actual occurrence of the Effective Time), and the holder thereof shall have no further rights thereunder except as expressly provided herein. Notwithstanding such termination of the Terminating Options, promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of a Terminating Option an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price of each such Terminating Option, and (y) the number of Shares subject to such Terminating Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (such payment to be net of applicable withholding taxes).   

 (ii) As to all LFC Stock Options other than Terminating Options, LFC shall, effective as of the Effective Time, (A) cause each such outstanding LFC Stock Option, whether or not exercisable or vested, to become fully exercisable and vested, (B) cause each such outstanding LFC Stock Option to be canceled and (C) in consideration of such cancellation, and, except to the extent IBC and the holder of any such LFC Stock Option otherwise agree, cause LFC to pay the holders of such LFC Stock Options an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price of each such LFC Stock Option, and (y) the number of Shares subject to such LFC Stock Option immediately prior to its cancellation (such payment to be net of applicable withholding taxes).     ##### 

    

 (b) Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act. The Board of Directors of each of LFC and IBC shall each grant all approvals and take all other actions required pursuant to Rules 16b-3(d) and 16(b)-3(e) under the 1934 Act to cause the disposition in the Merger of the Shares and the LFC Stock Options and the acquisition in the Merger of shares of IBC Common Stock or options to purchase the common stock of the Surviving Corporation awards pertaining to and applying to the common stock of the Surviving Corporation to be exempt from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act.   

 (c) Employee Issues. Between the date hereof and the Closing, IBC shall be afforded the reasonable opportunity to interview and meet with the employees of LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries and to provide training to, and such information as is reasonably necessary with respect to terms of continued employment for, such employees of LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries who will remain or are expected to remain employees immediately after the Effective Time, which terms of employment may be amended thereafter by IBC in its sole discretion. LFC shall terminate the 401(k) Plan maintained by LFC effective as of the day prior to the Effective Time. All of the other employee benefit plans and programs maintained by LFC and any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated effective as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, LFC shall amend the ESOP to provide that distributions to participants from such plan may be made in lump sum payments in the form of cash and/or employer stock as defined in such plan. IBC presently intends that, except to the extent that may be required by law, after the Merger, neither IBC or its Subsidiaries, LFC, the LFC Subsidiaries nor the Surviving Corporation will make additional contributions to the employee benefit plans or other programs that were sponsored by LFC or any of the LFC Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Merger. At and following the Effective Time, IBC shall take all actions necessary to complete the dissolution and winding up of the employee benefit plans maintained by LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries which are terminated at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that with respect to terminated deferred compensation plans, IBC shall distribute accrued vested benefits according to the terms of such plans; provided further; that with respect to the Section 125 Plan maintained by LFC or the LFC Subsidiaries, IBC agrees to maintain such plan from the Effective Time through December 31, 2004, for the benefit of the employees of LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries who are employed by IBC or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. IBC agrees that the employees of LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries who are retained as employees of IBC will be entitled effective as of the Effective Time to participate as newly hired employees in the employee benefit plans and programs maintained for employees of IBC and its affiliates, in accordance with the respective terms of such plans and programs; provided, however, that within thirty days following the Effective Time, such employees will be entitled to participate in the profit sharing plan sponsored by IBC and shall receive credit for service with LFC or LFC Subsidiaries for vesting and eligibility purposes with respect to the profit sharing plan sponsored by IBC; provided further, however, that with respect to the welfare benefit plans of IBC such employees shall receive credit for service with LFC or LFC Subsidiaries solely for purposes of eligibility, and IBC shall take all actions necessary or appropriate (including amending plans, if necessary) to facilitate such participation; provided further that any preexisting condition exclusion or waiting period applicable to any health care plan sponsored by IBC shall be waived with respect to any LFC or LFC Subsidiary employee. IBC agrees that the employees and former employees of LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries who are entitled to elect, or who have already elected, continuation of health insurance coverage pursuant to Code Section 4980B shall be entitled to elect continuation of health insurance coverage pursuant to Code Section 4980B     ##### 

    

under the IBC health plan. For purposes of determining each LFC or
LFC Subsidiarys employees benefit for the year in which the Merger occurs
under IBCs vacation or sick leave program, any vacation or sick leave taken
by a LFC or LFC Subsidiary employee preceding the Effective Time for the year
in which the Merger occurs will be deducted from the total IBC vacation or
sick leave benefits available to such employee for such year.  

 (d) Employment Agreements and Severance Policy. At and following the Effective Time, IBC and the IBC Subsidiaries shall honor, and IBC and the IBC Subsidiaries shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual obligations under the employment agreements and/or severance agreements set forth in Section 6.5(e)(i) of the LFC Disclosure Schedules. An employee of LFC or an LFC Subsidiary (other than an employee who is a party to an employment agreement or a severance agreement) whose employment is involuntarily terminated within six months following the Effective Time, shall be entitled to receive severance payments which shall be no less favorable that LFCs existing severance/separation policy which is set forth as Section 6.5(e)(ii) of the LFC Disclosure Schedule.   

 6.6 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except (a) if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, or cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on LFC or its Subsidiaries resulting from the Merger, (b) as provided in Section 8.2 and (c) the expenses of printing the Proxy Statement-Prospectus shall be shared equally between Local and IBC. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" includes all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 6.7 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.   

 (a) After the Effective Time IBC and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) or former officer, director or employee of LFC and the LFC Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any claim, action, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or employee of LFC or any of the LFC Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, solely to the same extent required under any indemnification provisions included in LFCs or LFC Subsidiarys, as the case may be, constituent or organizational documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that no Indemnified Party may settle any such claim without the prior approval of IBC (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).     ##### 

    

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) cause to be maintained in effect in its articles of incorporation and by-laws for a period of six years after the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, officers, directors and employees that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the articles of incorporation and by-laws of LFC as in effect on the date hereof and (ii) for a period of six years after the Effective Time, shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by LFC (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premiums currently paid by LFC for such insurance (which premiums LFC represents to be $185,000 per year in the aggregate); and, provided, further, that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.7 or the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation.   

 (d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 6.5 and this Section 6.7.   

 6.8 Public Announcements. LFC and IBC shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (ii) unless otherwise required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 6.9 Affiliate Letters. LFC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other Person, if any, who is an "affiliate" of LFC under Rule 145 of the 1933 Act to deliver to IBC as soon as practicable and prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus executed letter agreements, each in the form designated by IBC, providing that such Person will comply with Rule 145.
