 (e) _Offset_. References to the terms "Deferred Payment Amount" and "Unpaid Amount" contained in this _Section 2.5_ shall exclude an amount equal to Losses, or estimate thereof, with respect to which a Buyer Indemnitee has delivered a Notice of Claim to Seller pursuant to  _Section 10.2_ until such Notice of Claim is resolved; _provided_ , that, to the extent that Buyer shall have sufficient available liquidity or availability pursuant to the Revolving Facility to pay such disputed Losses as if they had been part of the Deferred Payment Amount, as determined in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_, on the Deferred Payment Date, Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to such disputed Losses with a third party escrow agent pursuant to an escrow agreement which the parties agree to negotiate in good faith and complete as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. 

   

 (f) _Restricted Payments_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of Buyer nor any Guarantor shall be required or permitted to make any payment pursuant to  _Section 2.5(a)_, _(b)_ or _(c)_ to the extent such payment would be prohibited by the terms and conditions of the definitive agreements entered into on the Closing Date in connection with the Financing to the extent such terms and conditions are not more restrictive than such terms and conditions with respect thereto set forth in the Financing Commitments (as in effect on the date hereof and without giving effect to any change resulting from the exercise of any flex provision). 

   

 Section 2.6 _Buyer Equity Cure Option_. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date if it is likely to be unable to satisfy the obligations set forth in _Section 2.3(b)(i)_ in full and in cash at the Closing due to a failure of any condition set forth in paragraph 11 of Exhibit D of the Financing Commitments, in which case Seller shall, to the extent the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.6_ would cure any Financing Failure that would otherwise occur, have the option (to be exercised in Sellers absolute and sole discretion not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the expected closing), to require Buyer to reduce (a) the amount of the Financing by up to $75 million from the maximum committed amounts pursuant to the Financing Commitments in order to cause such condition to be satisfied (the amount of such reduction, the " _Reduction Amount_ ") and (b) Buyers obligation pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(i)_ to pay the Estimated Purchase Price by the Reduction Amount, in which case, in lieu of payment in cash of the Reduction Amount, Buyer shall issue to Seller the Buyer Common Shares (collectively, the " _Equity Cure Option_ ");  _provided_ , that, Seller shall be required to elect the Equity Cure Option pursuant to this  _Section 2.6_, in such amount as would result in the satisfaction of the condition set forth in paragraph 11 of Exhibit D of the Financing Commitments, to the extent a Financing Failure would occur as a result of a Required Financial Information Restatement resulting in a decrease in EBITDA of more than $1,000,000 but less than $5,000,000, adjusted to exclude the effect of adjustments to reserves in respect of returns or 

  ##### 

  

    

deferred revenue solely as a result of accounting in respect of returns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, Buyer may in its sole and absolute
discretion satisfy the obligations set forth in _Section 2.3(b)(i)_ in full
and in cash at the Closing, regardless of whether such cash is obtained
through alternative debt or equity financing, in lieu of the Equity Cure
Option. If Seller elects the Equity Cure Option pursuant to this

representations and warranties with respect to (1) the due authorization,
valid issuance and non-assessability of the Buyer Common Stock issued

registration rights agreement providing Seller, among other things, no more
than one (1) demand registration rights and unlimited piggyback registration
rights, which agreements the parties agree to negotiate in good faith and
complete as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Sellers
right to or decision to elect (or not elect) the Equity Cure Option shall not
limit, abrogate or otherwise modify any right or remedy of Seller pursuant to
this Agreement to the extent otherwise available. Seller shall not be entitled
to elect the Equity Cure Option unless any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act relating to such acquisition of Buyer Common Shares by Seller
shall have expired or been terminated.

 (B) Buyer shall not, without the prior consent of Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make, or cause to permit to be made, any Tax election, or adopt or change any method of accounting, or undertake any extraordinary action on the Closing Date, that would

affect Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 (e) All transfer Taxes, recording fees and other similar Taxes that are imposed on any of the Parties by any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. 

   

 (f) _Transaction Tax Deductions_. 

   

 (i) All Transaction Tax Deductions paid or accrued on or before the Closing Date shall be treated as being incurred in a Pre-Closing Taxable Period and Buyer shall include the Transaction Tax Deductions to the extent permitted by applicable Law on the Tax Returns it is required to file pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ hereof and no party shall utilize the "next day rule" in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of non-U.S., state, or local Law) for purposes of reporting such items on the applicable Tax Returns. 

  

 (ii) All Tax Reductions relating to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period as a result of or attributable to the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be for the sole benefit of Seller. To the extent that Buyer, the Company, or any of their Subsidiaries receives or realizes a Tax Reduction that is for the benefit of Seller pursuant to this _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_, Buyer shall within ten (10) days of receiving such Tax Reduction (if it is in the form of a Tax refund), or filing the Tax Return realizing the Tax Reduction (if it is in the form of a Tax credit, offset or reduction in cash Taxes paid) pay to Seller the amount of such Tax Reduction, but only to the extent that such Tax Reduction is not included as an asset for purposes of computing the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined. 

  

 (iii) To the extent that Buyer, the Company, or any of their Subsidiaries realizes any Tax Reduction in a Post-Closing Taxable Period as a result of or attributable to any Transaction Tax Deductions (including as a result of utilizing any net operating loss or other Tax 

   ##### 

  

 

attribute that was created as a result of the Transaction Tax Deductions),
Buyer shall, within ten (10) days of receiving such Tax Reduction (if it is
in the form of a Tax refund), or filing the Tax Return realizing the Tax
Reduction (if it is in the form of a Tax credit, offset or reduction in
cash Taxes paid), pay to Seller the amount of such Tax Reduction, but only to
the extent that such Tax Reduction is not included as an asset for purposes
of computing the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined. 

   

 (iv) All Tax Reductions computed under _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_ and _Section 6.2(f)(iii)_ shall be computed assuming that Buyer, the Company, and each of their Subsidiaries recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit and use all net operating loss carryforwards (other than any that may be created or increased as a result of the Transaction Tax Deductions), whether now existing or hereafter available, before recognizing any Tax Reduction as a result of or attributable to any Transaction Tax Deductions, and the amount of the Tax Reduction shall be determined on a with and without basis. 

  

 (v) Within ten (10) days of filing its U.S. federal income tax returns for taxable years subject to this _Section 6.2(f)_, Buyer shall provide Seller in writing with the basis for its determination that it has realized or has not realized a Tax Reduction attributable to the Transaction Tax Deductions and a schedule with reasonable supporting detail. If Seller disputes the amount of such Tax Reduction, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing within sixty (60) days of its receipt of such notice and the basis for its objection and Seller and Buyer shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute. If Seller and Buyer cannot resolve such dispute, the amount of the Tax Reduction in question shall be determined by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firms determination of the item shall be no greater than Sellers claim with respect to the amount of the Tax Reduction and no less than Buyers initial determination of the Tax Reduction. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall provide all necessary (including confidential) information to the Accounting Firm so that the Accounting Firm can determine the amount of the Tax Reduction, provided that the Accounting Firm shall not disclose, nor shall be required to disclose, any confidential information (including Tax Returns) to Seller. If Seller is entitled to any payment in addition to amounts previously paid pursuant to  _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_ or _Section 6.2(f)(iii)_ in respect of a Tax Reduction after resolution of the dispute pursuant to this _Section 6.2(f)(v)_ Buyer shall pay to Seller such additional amount within ten (10) Business Days of the resolution of the dispute. 

  

 (vi) In the event Buyer makes any payment to Seller pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_ or  _Section 6.2(f)(iii)_ and as a result of a final determination of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation, examination, audit or other claim by a Tax authority (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), the amount of any such Tax Reduction is reduced, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of the reduction in such Tax Reduction within ten (10) days of receipt of written notification from Buyer of the final determination of such Tax Proceeding. For this purpose, a "final determination" shall mean a settlement, compromise, or other agreement with the relevant Tax authority, whether contained in an IRS Form 870 or other comparable form, or otherwise, or such procedurally later event, such as a closing agreement with the relevant Tax authority, or a deficiency notice with respect to which the period for filing a petition with the Tax Court or the relevant state, local or foreign tribunal has expired or a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or as to which the time for appeal has expired. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (vii) The obligations of Seller, Buyer, and the Company and its Subsidiaries under _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_ , _Section 6.2(f)(iii)_, _Section 6.2(f)(iv)_, _Section 6.2(f)(v)_ and _Section 6.2(f)(vi)_ shall only apply with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2012. 

  

 (g) Prior to, or at the Closing, Seller shall either (i) deliver to Buyer a certificate from Seller that states Seller is not a foreign person in form and substance prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) or (ii) or cause the Company to deliver a certificate, in form and substance as prescribed by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), stating that the Company is not, and has not been during the relevant period, a "United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Code section 897(c). 

   

 Section 6.3 _Access to Information_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable advance notice, the Company shall, and shall cause each other Group Company to, provide to Buyer, the Lenders and their respective authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the officers and senior management, the premises, agents, books, records, and contracts (in force or terminated) of or pertaining to any Group Company as Buyer may reasonably request in writing, in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business operations of any Group Company; _provided_ , that no such access shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties (or the remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company based upon the opinion of counsel, (i) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company, or (ii) contain any competitively sensitive information to the extent that withholding access to such information or documents is necessary under applicable antitrust Law; _provided,_ further, that the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to implement appropriate procedures to enable the provision of access and disclosure to Buyer or Buyers counsel, as the case may be, without causing such waiver or violation of law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide Buyer with unaudited consolidated monthly financial statements of the Company (excluding footnotes) consisting of a balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows for each month ending after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each such month (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the end of any such month). Buyer shall hold and treat and will cause its officers, employees, auditors and other authorized representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information concerning the Group Companies furnished to Buyer, the Lenders or their respective authorized representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are by this reference hereby incorporated herein except for disclosure (a) as required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for registered offerings of securities of Buyer, (b) of the type and form customarily included in offering or other documents that may be used in private placements by Buyer under Rule 144A of the Securities Act or for purposes of any other debt or loan financing or syndication, (c) as required in any document filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company pursuant to the Exchange Act and (d) with the prior written consent of the Company 

     ##### 

  

    

(which consent should not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
made in any meetings, road shows, drafting sessions, rating agency
presentations and due diligence sessions conducted in connection with such
registered offerings of securities or private placements or bank financings
and syndications. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be responsible for
any breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the Lenders or their respective
authorized representatives. 

   

 Section 6.4 _Efforts to Consummate; Consents; Filings_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Seller, Buyer and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable after the date hereof the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in _Article 7_ ). Each of Seller, Buyer and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of all Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall make and not withdraw an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly (and in any event, within five (5) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act; _provided_ , that Seller and the Company shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay a request by Buyer to withdraw any such filing. 

   

 (b) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted as promptly as practicable, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion and proposal made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto relating to a proceeding under the HSR Act and shall provide to the Companys or Buyers outside counsel, as applicable, all documents and information reasonably requested by such counsel promptly upon request, subject to any reasonable restrictions. 

   

 (c) Buyer covenants and agrees that between the date hereof and the Closing Date or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 8, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if such business competes in any material line of business of the Group Companies and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any 

    ##### 

  

    

authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental
Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) increase the risk of not being
able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) delay or prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) In connection with any actual or potential issuance of Buyer Common Stock to Seller pursuant to the Seller Note and/or _Section 2.6_, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to provide Seller with all information necessary, and otherwise cooperate with Seller, in connection with any notification or filing required to be made by Seller pursuant to the HSR Act. 

   

 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in paragraphs (a)-(c) of this _Section 6.4_, if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Entity or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other applicable Governmental Entity challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any law or which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Buyer, Seller and the Company shall take all actions that constitute reasonable best efforts necessary to resolve any such objections or suits (or threatened suits) so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to close as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than the Termination Date (as extended); _provided_ , _that_ , any obligation to make or agree to make a Divestiture by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may, at the Companys option, be conditioned upon and effective as of the Closing and shall not affect the other terms or conditions hereunder. Without limitation to the terms of _Section 6.4(b)_, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, Buyer shall keep Seller and the Company apprised of material communications regarding proposed remedies to any objections that may be expressed by the FTC, the Justice Department or other Governmental Entities and will consult with the Company and give due consideration to its views with respect to any possible Divestiture plans; _provided, however_ ,  _that_ , subject to and without limiting the obligations of Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , following the date hereof, Buyer shall have the sole and exclusive right, to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the Divestiture of such assets of Buyer, the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) to take any action as may be required to resolve such objections or suits. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any of Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates be required to make or agree to make a Divestiture or to take or agree to take any action, that, individually or together with any other such actions, if, as of the time of the agreement to make such Divestiture, doing so would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a failure of the conditions to the Financing to be satisfied at or prior to the Closing or a failure to be able to meet financial covenants contained in the Senior Secured Facilities Documentation (as defined in the Financing Commitments), in each case, without giving effect to the Equity Cure Option; in making the foregoing determination, Buyer shall be entitled to consider, among other things, the anticipated impact of any Divesture on the pro forma Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Financing Commitments) of the Buyer for the 

     ##### 

  

    

most recent four fiscal quarter period included within the Required Financial
Information and to extent to which such Divestiture would reasonably be
expected to result in a default or event of default pursuant to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments in any future fiscal periods. For
avoidance of doubt, other than as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, Buyer shall undertake any and all other actions that constitute
reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective as promptly and
practicable after the date hereof the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement,  _provided_ , _that_ , in no event shall Buyer be required to
agree to any Divestiture before such time upon which the failure to agree to
such Divestiture would reasonably be expected to cause the condition set
forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ not to be satisfied before the Termination Date
(as extended, if applicable). " _Divesture_ " means any of the
following actions (i) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or
holding separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, any
material entities, assets or facilities of any Group Company after the
Closing or any material entities, facilities or assets of Buyer or its
Affiliates, (ii) terminating, amending or assigning existing material
relationships and contractual rights and obligations, (iii) amending,
assigning or terminating existing material licenses or other
material agreements and entering into such new licenses or other agreements,
and/or (iv) otherwise disposing of or conducting its business in a manner
which would resolve such objections or suits (or threatened suits)
(collectively, " _Divestitures_ "). 

   

 Section 6.5 Public Announcements. Without limiting in any way the provisions of _Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.10_, Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company and Seller, on the other hand, shall consult with one another and seek one anothers approval before issuing any press release or making any filing or disclosure with the SEC, or otherwise making any written communication to customers, vendors or suppliers, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not make any such press release, filing, disclosure or communication prior to such consultation and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer, after reasonable consultation with Seller, may make any such communication which it in good faith believes, based upon the advice of counsel, is required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party may make internal announcements to their respective employees that are not inconsistent in any material respects with the Parties prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Buyer shall cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director, officer, employee and agent of any Group Company and the fiduciaries of any Employee Benefit Plan (collectively, the " _Indemnified D andO Parties_"), as provided in such Group Companys Governing Documents, or any agreements between an Indemnified DandO Party and such Group Company set forth in _Schedule 6.6(a)_, with respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, to survive the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and Buyer shall cause the Company to advance expenses in connection with such indemnification as provided in such Group Companys Governing Documents or other applicable agreements. The 

    ##### 

  

    

indemnification and liability limitation or exculpation provisions of the
Group Companies Governing Documents shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified DandO Parties, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Buyer and each of the Group Companies shall, jointly and severally, indemnify all Indemnified DandO Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors, officers, employees and agents of the Group Companies or as a fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan, whether asserted or claimed at or after or occurring before the Closing Date (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). If any Indemnified DandO Party is or becomes involved in any Claim in connection with any matter subject to indemnification hereunder, Buyer and each of the Group Companies shall, jointly and severally, advance as incurred any costs or expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or obligations of any kind (" _Damages_ ") out of or incurred in connection with such Claim, subject to Buyers or the Group Companys, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified DandO Party to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that such Indemnified DandO Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the event of any such Claim, (i) Buyer and each of the Group Companies shall cooperate with the Indemnified DandO Party in the defense of any such Claim and (ii) neither Buyer nor any of the Group Companies shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified DandO Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified DandO Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified DandO Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified DandO Party otherwise consents. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company or any Group Company to, jointly and severally, maintain in effect for at least six (6) years after the Closing Date the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Group Companies or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or on the Closing Date (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) so long as Buyer and the applicable Group Company are not required to pay an annual premium in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the applicable Group Company for such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 250% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If Buyer or the applicable Group Company are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company or any Group Company to, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 

   

 (d) Buyer hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified DandO Parties may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by other Persons. Buyer hereby agrees (i) that Buyer and the Group Companies are the indemnitor of first 

    ##### 

  

    

resort (i.e., their obligations to the Indemnified DandO Parties are primary
and any obligation of such other Persons to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any such
Indemnified DandO Party are secondary), (ii) that Buyer and the Group Companies
shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by any such
Indemnified DandO Party and shall be liable for the full indemnifiable amounts,
without regard to any rights any such Indemnified DandO Party may have against
any such other Person and (iii) that Buyer irrevocably waives, relinquishes
and releases (and shall cause the Group Companies to irrevocably
waive, relinquish and release) such other Persons from any and all claims
against any such other Persons for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Buyer further agrees that no
advancement or payment by any of such other Persons on behalf of any
such Indemnified DandO Party with respect to any claim for which such
Indemnified DandO Party has sought indemnification from any of the Group
Companies shall affect the foregoing and such other Persons shall have a
right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement
or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnified DandO Party
against the Group Companies. 

   

 (e) Each of the Indemnified DandO Parties entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation and exculpation set forth in this _Section 6.6_, together with such Persons heirs and legal representatives, is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.6_. This  _Section 6.6_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Group Companies. The covenants contained in this _Section 6.6_ shall not be exclusive of any other right to which an Indemnified DandO Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. In the event that Buyer or any of the Group Companies or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Buyer shall, and shall cause the applicable Group Company to, take all necessary action so that the successors or assigns of Buyer or such Group Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.6_. 

   

 Section 6.7 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company nor Seller shall take, or permit any Group Company or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action to solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than Buyer and/or its respective Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of the Companys equity securities or any merger, sale of material assets or similar transaction involving any Group Company, other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business, and shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations that are ongoing and promptly request the return or destruction of any documents and information provided to any Person in connection with such discussion. Seller and the Company, as the case may be, shall enforce any existing confidentiality agreements relating to the Company or the business of any Group Company in all material respects and not waive any material rights thereunder. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 6.8 _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries to, until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of the Group Companies in existence on the Closing Date and make the same available for inspection and copying by Seller (at Sellers expense) during normal business hours of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. No such books, records or documents shall be destroyed after the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date by Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without first advising Seller in writing and giving Seller a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof. 

   

 Section 6.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Group Company to grant all of its employees credit for any service with such Group Company earned prior to the Closing Date for eligibility and vesting purposes under the New Plans. In addition, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause to be waived all pre existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (B) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of any Group Company to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial participation. 

   

 (c) If requested by Buyer at least five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Group Companies shall use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably necessary appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Closing Date occurs, any Employee Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Group Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the Group Companies are required to terminate any Group Company 401(k) Plan, then the Group Companies shall provide to Buyer prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the resolutions authorizing the termination of such Group Company 401(k) Plan (the form and 

    ##### 

  

    

substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

   

 (d) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee of any Group Company any right to continued employment for any period following the Closing Date, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan. Further, this _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.9_. 

   

 Section 6.10 _Financing_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing as soon as practicable after the date hereof on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (including the flex provisions), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the applicable Financing Commitments, (ii) maintain in effect the applicable Financing Commitments, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the applicable Financing Commitments as promptly as practicable on terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained therein or otherwise not materially less favorable to Buyer in the aggregate than those contained in the applicable Financing Commitments, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to Buyer contained in the applicable Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) within Buyers control, including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fee required as a condition to the Financing and punctual compliance with the terms, including with respect to payment of principal, interest and fees, of Buyers existing credit agreement and (v) upon satisfaction of such conditions, and the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), enforce all of its rights under the applicable Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) and consummate the applicable Financing on a timely basis (taking into account the Marketing Period), but in no event later than the Termination Date (it being understood that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Buyer to obtain the Financing or any Alternative Financing). Upon request, Buyer shall inform Seller and the Company on a reasonable basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide copies of all material documents provided to the Lenders to Seller and the Company, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller. Other than as set forth in _Section 6.10(b)_, Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto), in each case if such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate net amount of the Financing or (B) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or 

     ##### 

  

    

(2) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against
the Lenders with respect to the funding of the Financing necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event all conditions
applicable to the Financing Commitments have been satisfied and all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied
(or waived), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders
to fund the Financing required to permit Buyer to consummate the purchase of
the Shares at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and to perform
its obligations to be performed at or prior to the Closing under this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including any related repayment or
refinancing of any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
payment of all of its fees and expenses required in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated at
the Closing, including by taking enforcement action to cause the persons
providing the Financing to fund such Financing. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify the obligations
of the Lenders in respect of the marketing, offering and placement of a
"regular way" bond deal on the terms set forth in the Fee Letter that is part
of the Financing Commitments (as in effect as of the date hereof). 

   

 (b) Buyer shall give Seller and the Company prompt notice: (i) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing of which Buyer or its Affiliates becomes aware; (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to any (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated at the Closing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive agreement with respect thereto, and (iii) if all or any material portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments so as to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated at the Closing. 

   

 (c) If all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange to promptly obtain the Financing or such portion of the Financing from alternative sources, which may include one or more of a senior secured debt financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any other financing or offer and sale of other debt securities, or any combination thereof, in an amount sufficient, when added to any portion of the Financing that is available, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Alternative Financing_ ") and (ii) obtain a new financing commitment letter (the " _Alternative Commitment Letter_ ") and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that, with respect to both clauses (i) and (ii) above, provides for financing (A) on terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer than those set forth in the Financing Commitments, (B) containing conditions to draw and other terms that 

    ##### 

  

    

would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are
not more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained
in the Financing Commitments (after giving effect to all flex provisions
contained therein) as of the date hereof, and (2) would not reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (C) in an amount that is sufficient,
when added to any portion of the Financing that is available and Buyers
available cash resources, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid
by Buyer to consummate the purchase of the Shares at Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.3_, including any related repayment or refinancing of any
Indebtedness of the Company, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries
and payment of all of its fees and expenses required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In such
event, (w) Buyer shall be deemed to make the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 5.5_ with respect to the Alternative Financing as of
the date the Alternative Commitment Letter is obtained by Buyer; (x) the term
"Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include
any Alternative Financing, (y) the term "Financing Commitments" as used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Commitment Letter
and (z) the term "Lenders" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any source of Alternative Financing that is a party to
any Alternative Commitment Letter. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the officers, employees, advisors and other representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide all reasonable cooperation with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and that is customary in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain the Financing (provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) participate in a reasonable number of meetings, road shows, drafting sessions, rating agency presentations and due diligence sessions; (ii) furnish Buyer and the Lenders as promptly as reasonably practicable after written request therefor with pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries including all financial statements and financial and other data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for registered offerings of securities, and of the type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act or bank information memoranda (including quarterly financial statements that have been reviewed by the Companys auditors pursuant to SAS 100 and pro forma financial statements complying with the requirements of Regulation S-X), and other documents reasonably required to satisfy any customary negative assurance opinion, to consummate the Financings at the time the Financings are to be consummated, including all information and data necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs 5 and 9 of Exhibit D of the Financing Commitments (information and data required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (ii) being referred to as the " _Required Financial Information_ "); in each case, regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as is customary in connection with the Financing and any security required therefor; (iii) provide materials regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries to Buyer and the Lenders in the preparation of customary offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda and rating agency presentations; (iv) reasonably facilitating the granting of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral, guarantees, mortgages, other definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents; (v) obtaining customary authorization letters with respect to the bank information memoranda and consents of 

    ##### 

  

    

accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing; (vi) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants
comfort letters, surveys and title insurance; (vii) take commercially
reasonable actions necessary to (X) permit the Lenders to evaluate the
Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral
arrangements as of the Closing and (Y) establish, effective as of the
Closing, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the Financing; provided, that neither Seller,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the
Financing; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering or information document.
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any Group Company or
any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, representatives, agents or advisors (including legal,
financial and accounting advisors) shall (x) be required to deliver or
execute any certificates, agreements or other instruments prior to Closing
(or, in the case of Seller, at any time), or (y) have any responsibility for,
or incur any liability to any Person, in each case under or in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing or any Alternative Financing that Buyer
may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
(including the Group Companies) and their respective Affiliates and directors,
officers, employees, representatives, agents and advisors (including legal,
financial and accounting advisors) from and against any and all Losses
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing or any Alternative Financing and any information utilized
in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or
its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith). Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs
or expenses incurred by the Group Companies in connection with cooperation
provided for in this _Section 6.10(d)_. 

   

 (e) Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take all other actions required by the terms of the Credit Facilities or reasonably requested by Buyer in order to permit repayment on the Closing Date of all outstanding Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities on the terms thereof and the termination of such Credit Facilities.

     ##### 

  

     

 (b) In no event shall Buyer request any extension of credit be made under the Revolving Facility prior to the Deferred Payment Date if, after giving effect thereto and to the application of proceeds therefrom, the amount of the undrawn commitments under the Revolving Facility plus unrestricted cash of the Buyer and its restricted subsidiaries would be less than the maximum potential amount of the Deferred Payment Amount at such time (the " _Minimum Liquidity Condition_ ").

the conditions to this Agreement shall have been satisfied or waived (other

conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), Sellers
right to receive payment of the Financing Failure Termination Fee or the HSR

agreement contained herein by Buyer or the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated or arising from any claim or cause of
action in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and upon payment of the Financing Failure Termination Fee or the HSR
Failure Termination Fee, as applicable, in accordance with this _Section
8.2(a)_ as a result of such termination, none of Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates nor any of the Financing Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event of a termination or deemed termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, the Financing Failure Termination Fee shall
not be payable in the event that (x) Buyer shall be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ (after giving effect to the
notice requirement and cure opportunity set forth therein) as a result of a
knowing and intentional breach by Seller of the covenants and agreements
contained in  _Section 6.10_, and (y) such breach shall have proximately

    ##### 

  

    

as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such amount was
required to be made through the date such amount was actually received.

 (d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

 (b) Subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each Group Company to, indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Affiliates and directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, and advisors (including legal, financial and accounting advisors) (each, a

as of the Closing, or in any certificate delivered to the Company or

 Section 9.3 _Third Party Claims_. 

   

 (a) If a Claim by a Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate thereof (including such a Claim with respect to or arising out of Taxes brought by the Internal Revenue Service or a similar Governmental Entity) (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made against any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _ARTICLE IX_ , such Indemnified Party shall promptly, following the Indemnified Partys knowledge of such Third Party Claim, give a Notice of Claim to the Party obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party (such notified Party, the " _Responsible Party_ "); provided that the failure to give such Notice of Claim shall not affect the Indemnified Partys right to seek indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE IX_ and shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel (including, as applicable, counsel and/or an accounting firm in the case of a Claim relating to Taxes) reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and at the expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Responsible Party in determining the validity of any Third Party Claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters during normal business hours and after reasonable advance notice.

    ##### 

  

    

Party to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by
such Indemnified Party (the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne

settle any such claim and shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Responsible Party. If the
Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys Notice of Claim hereunder
that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall
not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.
The Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified
Party, enter into any settlement that does not include as a term thereof the
giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of a
release from all liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of
any judgment, unless any liability resulting from such settlement is a Loss
that is indemnifiable in full hereunder. 

   

 (c) All of the Parties shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with any Third Party Claims in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ , and shall reasonably cooperate in such defense and furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 (a) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the total amount of Losses which the Buyer Indemnitees would recover under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except with respect to any breach of (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.11_ ( _Employee Plans_ ) and _Section 3.16_ ( _Tax Matters_ ) or (ii) any breach of a Specified Representation), but for this _Section 9.4(a)_, exceeds $8,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case, following the incurrence by the Buyer Indemnitees of Losses in excess of the Deductible, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover only the Losses incurred by them in excess of $4,250,000; 

   

 (b) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover for any particular Loss (including any series of related Losses) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except with respect to any breach of (i) any Specified Representation or (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.4_ (Financial Statements), _Section 3.8_ (Absence of Changes and Undisclosed Liabilities), _Section 3.11_ ( _Employee Plans_ ) and _Section 3.16_ ( _Tax Matters_ )) unless such Loss (including any series of similar or related Losses) equals or exceeds $25,000; 

  

 _provided_ , that, for purposes of determining the thresholds set forth in
the immediately preceding two paragraphs, any reference in the
representations and warranties of the Company and Seller 

      ##### 

  

    

contained in _ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ (other than _Section
3.4_ (Financial Statements), _Section 3.8_ (Absence of Changes and
Undisclosed Liabilities) and  _Section 3.18(b)_ (Personal Property)) to
materiality, material adverse effect, Company Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications shall be disregarded but, for the avoidance of doubt,
knowledge and dollar threshold qualifications shall not be disregarded); 

   

 (c) without limiting the last paragraph of this _Section 9.4_, the maximum liability of Seller with respect to Losses indemnifiable (i) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ (except with respect to (x) any breach of the Specified Representations and _Section 3.20_ (Regulatory Matters) or (y) _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, (iv) or (v)), together with any Losses indemnifiable with respect to any breach of the Specified Representations or any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.20_ (Regulatory Matters), shall be equal to $42,500,000 in the aggregate; (ii) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.20_ (Regulatory Matters), together with any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ (except with respect to  _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _(iv)_ or _(v)_ ) shall be equal to $85,000,000 in the aggregate, (iii) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to (x) willful misconduct constituting an intentional and knowing breach of Sellers covenants hereunder and (y) _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ , together with any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, shall not exceed $125,000,000 in the aggregate, or (iv) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to (x) any breach of any Specified Representation and (y) _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ or  _(v)_ , together with any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price; 

   

 (d) the amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of any amounts recovered by the Buyer Indemnitees under insurance policies or from other third party collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with respect to such Losses; 

   

 (e) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ for any Loss to the extent that such Loss was taken into account in the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_; and 

   

 (f) no Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ with respect to, and solely to the extent that, any Loss would have been mitigated had such Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, had used commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses (solely to the extent such efforts are required by Law) after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to such Loss, including seeking indemnification pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 20, 2008, by and among Seller, Bondi Merger Sub, Inc., BGI and T.I. GPO, Inc. and the Escrow Agreement, dated as of August 15, 2008, by and among BGI, the Company, T.I. GPO, Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 

  

Except in the case of fraud, the sole recourse of any Buyer Indemnitee for any
Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder from Seller pursuant
to this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be an offset against the Deferred Payment Amount
and, if applicable, the Seller Note, in which event the Deferred Payment
Amount and, if applicable, the Seller Note shall be reduced by any such
amounts so offset; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim for
Losses pursuant to  _Section_  

     ##### 

  

    

 _9.2(a)(iv)_ or _9.2(a)(v)_ is outstanding and not resolved as of the
Deferred Payment Date, the Deferred Payment shall not be reduced in respect
of such claim by more than $15,000,000. In any case where a Buyer Indemnitee
recovers, under insurance policies or from other third party collateral
sources, any amount in respect of a matter for which such Buyer
Indemnitee was fully indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, such Buyer
Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to Seller the amount so recovered (after
deducting therefrom the amount of such Losses not previously indemnified by
Seller and the expenses incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee in procuring
such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so
offset against the Deferred Payment Amount in respect of such matter and (ii)
any amount expended by Seller in pursuing or defending any claim arising out
of such matter. 

   

 Section 9.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All payments offset against the Deferred Payment Amount or otherwise made pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law, and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement. In determining the amount of any indemnification payment for a Loss suffered or incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") hereunder, the amount of such Loss shall be (i) increased to take into account any additional cash Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnitee arising from the receipt of indemnification payments hereunder (" _Tax Costs_ ") and (ii) decreased to take into account any deduction, credit or other tax benefit that results in an actual reduction in cash Taxes owed by the Indemnitee with respect to such Loss ("Tax Benefits"), in each case only in the year the Loss is incurred. In computing the amount of any such Tax Cost or Tax Benefit, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnification payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) in the case of fraud, (ii) with respect to the matters covered by _Section 2.4_ and (iii) in the case where a Party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant to _Section 10.14_, from and after the Closing the rights of the Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties and any Indemnified Party with respect to any matter in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement or its subject matter.

 Section 10.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. 

   

 Section 10.4 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses; provided that in the event that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are 

      ##### 

  

    

consummated, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay all Seller
Expenses that are unpaid prior to the Closing to the extent the Purchase
Price is reduced in an amount equal to such Seller Expenses pursuant to
_Section 2.4_. 

   

 Section 10.5 _Construction; Interpretation_. 

   

 (a) The term "this Agreement" means this Stock Purchase Agreement together with the disclosure schedules to this Agreement (the " _Schedules_ ") hereto, as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against any Party. 

   

 (b) Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or use thereof: 

   

 (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules, and not to any particular section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; 

  

 (iii) words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice versa; 

  

 (iv) the words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; 

  

 (v) references herein to this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or any Ancillary Document which is a contract or agreement shall mean such contract or agreement as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof; 

  

 (vi) references herein to any Law or any license shall mean such Law or license as amended, modified, codified, reenacted, supplemented or superseded in whole or in part, and in effect from time to time; and 

  

 (vii) references herein to any Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending, replacing or interpreting or supplementing such Law or regulation. 

  

 Section 10.6 _Schedules_. All Schedules, or documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule referenced by a 

      ##### 

  

    

particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other section in this Agreement if the relevance of
such disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in any Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether
any obligation, items or matter not described herein or included in a
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted assigns and, except as provided in _Section 6.6_, _Section 6.10(d)_, _ARTICLE IX_ and the last sentence of this _Section 10.7_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The Financing Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries with respect to _Section 8.2(a)_, _Section 10.12_, _Section 10.13_ and  _Section 10.14(b)_. 

   

 Section 10.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. 

   

 Section 10.9 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf)), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or pdf shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.10 _Knowledge of the Company_. For all purposes of this Agreement, the phrase "to the Companys knowledge" and "known by the Company" and any derivations thereof shall mean as of the applicable date, the actual knowledge of Patrick Ryan, Joe Greskoviak, Tom Sherry, Michael Berryhill, Greg Ericson, Jonathan Napier, Michael Lozich, Laurie Jackson, Melinda May, Paul Carmody, David Klumpe, Jason Erdell and Kathy Ayers, none of whom shall have any personal liability or obligations regarding such knowledge. 

   

 Section 10.11 _Limitation on Damages and Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Party shall be liable for any punitive, special, speculative or exemplary damages, relating to any breach of representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto;  _provided_ , that Parties shall be liable for consequential damages (including loss of revenue, income or profits, loss or diminution in value of assets of securities) which are reasonably foreseeable based on the facts and circumstances giving rise to or underlying the applicable Loss but only to the extent reasonable and for a reasonable and commercial period of time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall any Party be liable for Losses calculated on the basis of a multiplier or similar concept to the extent such Losses arise from one time, non- 

      ##### 

  

    

recurring circumstances that do not impact any fiscal period other than the
fiscal period in which such Losses have arisen. Except in the case of fraud,
no breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any
right on the part of Buyer or Seller to rescind this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby following the Closing. 

   

 Section 10.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, (INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING ANY OF THE FINANCING PARTIES) IN EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. 

   

 Section 10.13 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in New York, New York, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing (including any such action or proceeding involving any of the Financing Parties), (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring any such action or proceeding in any other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 10.13_, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each Party agrees that a final, nonappealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party further agrees that it will not commence or join in any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, against any of the Financing Parties other than in any state or federal court sitting in New York, New York. 

   

 Section 10.14 _Remedies_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one 

      ##### 

  

    

remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not
perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement
in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section 8.2_ and _Section
10.14(b)_, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including _Section 6.10_ and Buyers
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if
it is required to do so hereunder), in each case without posting a bond
or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Subject to _Section 10.14(b)_, the foregoing
right shall include the right of Seller to cause Buyer to use its reasonable
best efforts to seek to enforce the terms of the Financing Commitment (and
any definitive agreements related thereto) against the Financing Parties and
any other applicable Person to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to
such Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) and
applicable Laws and to thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated at the Closing, in
each case, if the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ and 
_Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing). Buyer shall
cooperate with the Company and Seller in connection with any such enforcement
efforts related to enforcing the terms of the Financing Commitments (or
any definitive agreement related thereto) pursuant to this _Section
10.14_. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that, except for their obligations to provide the Financing pursuant to the Financing Commitments, the Financing Parties will not have any liability in monetary damages or otherwise, or owe any obligation to the Group Companies, Seller and their respective Affiliates and equityholders hereunder or under the Financing Commitments or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or arising from any claim or cause of action in connection therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Buyers obligation to complete the Closing in the event of a Financing Failure. 

   

 Section 10.15 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP and Epstein Becker and Green, P.C. have each represented Seller and the Group Companies. All of the parties recognize the community of interest that exists and will continue to exist until the Closing, and the parties agree that such community of interest should continue to be recognized after the Closing. Specifically, the parties agree that (a) Buyer shall not, and from and after the Closing shall cause each of the Group Companies to not, seek to have Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP or Epstein Becker and Green, P.C. disqualified from representing Seller in any dispute (whether in contract or tort) that may arise between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer or, from and after the Closing, any Group Company, on the other, based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in whole or in part and (b) in connection with any dispute that may arise between Seller, on the one hand, Buyer or, from and after the Closing, the Group 

      ##### 

  

    

Companies and their respective successors, stockholders, employees, officers,
partners, members, trustees, directors, managers, agents and representatives,
on the other, Seller (and not any Group Company) will have the right to
decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client privilege that may apply
to any communications between any Group Company and Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP or Epstein Becker and Green, P.C. that occurred
on or prior to the Closing. 

   

 Section 10.16 _Release of Claims_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the TCP Entities to, unconditionally and irrevocably and forever release and discharge the Company, their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, and any present or former directors, managers, officers, employees, or agents of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ "), of and from, and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive, any and all claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings, covenants, liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of action, obligations, accounts, and liabilities of any kind or character whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract, direct or indirect, at law or in equity (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ ") that such Person ever had or as of the Closing Date has against any Released Party, for or by reason of any matter, circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, cause or thing whatsoever arising prior to the Closing;  _provided_ , that this release (i) does not extend to Released Claims to enforce the terms or any breach of this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any of the provisions set forth herein or therein, (ii) shall not affect any right to indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses to which any such Person may be entitled as a result of such Persons ownership of Shares or service as a manager, director, officer, employee, consultant or other representative of the Company, including the rights set forth in _Section 6.6_, (iii) shall not affect any claim Seller may have against any Released Party (other than any Group Company) in respect of fraud, breach of any agreement between such Released Party (other than any Group Company) and Seller or in such Released Partys capacity as an officer, director or employee of Seller and (iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 10.16_, with respect to the TCP Entities, the term Released Claims against any Released Party shall be limited only to the extent related to any of such TCP Entitys investment in the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, each contract or arrangement listed on Schedule 3.19 shall be terminated on or prior to the Closing. 

   

 Section 10.17 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
