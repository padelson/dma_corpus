<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Real Property</U>. No Group Company owns any real property. <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.18(a)</U>
sets forth a list of all leases (each, a &#147;<U>Material Real Property Lease</U>&#148;) of real property
(such real property, the &#147;<U>Leased Real Property</U>&#148;) pursuant to which any Group Company is a
tenant, except for any lease or agreement pursuant to which any Group Company holds Leased Real
Property for which the aggregate remaining payments thereunder do not exceed $50,000. Each
Material Real Property Lease is valid and binding on the applicable Group Company and enforceable
in accordance with its terms against such Group Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, each
other party thereto, in each case, in all material respects (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting generally the enforcement of
creditors&#146; rights and subject to general principles of equity). Each of the Group Companies, and,
to the Company&#146;s knowledge, each of the other parties thereto, has performed all obligations
required to be performed by it in all material respects under each Material Real Property Lease.
To the knowledge of the Company, there exists no event, condition or occurrence which, after notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default by a Group Company or by a
counterparty to a Material Real Property Lease, under any Material Real Property Lease. There are
(i)&nbsp;no material written or, to the knowledge of the Company, material oral subleases, concessions
or other contracts granting to any Person other than a Group Company the right to use or occupy any
Leased Real Property and (ii)&nbsp;no outstanding options or rights of first refusal to purchase all or
a portion of such properties.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Personal Property</U>. The Group Companies collectively own or hold under valid

Intellectual Property Rights) necessary for the conduct of their businesses as currently conducted,
subject to no Lien except for Liens identified on <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.18(b)</U> and Permitted Liens,
except where a failure to own or hold such leases would not be reasonably expected to have a
material and adverse effect on the Group Companies, taken as a whole.

compensation and benefits in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices,
there are no contracts or arrangements between any Group Company, on the one hand, and Affiliates
of the Company (other than any Group Company or any employee of any Group Company who is not an
officer of any Group Company), on the other hand. None of the Group Companies or, to the knowledge
of the Company, their respective Affiliates, directors or officers (i)&nbsp;possesses, directly or
indirectly, any material financial interest in, or is a director or officer or employee of, any
Person (other than any Group Company) which is a material client, supplier, customer, lessor or

Commitment (and any definitive agreements related thereto) against the Financing Parties and any
other applicable Person to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to such Financing Commitments

<U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U> have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing). Buyer shall cooperate with the Company and Seller in connection with
any such enforcement efforts related to enforcing the terms of the Financing Commitments (or any
definitive agreement related thereto) pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U>.
