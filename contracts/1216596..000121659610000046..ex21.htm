owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Company, Parent, and
Merger Sub have (i) approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent by way
of merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA") and (ii)
approved and declared advisable the Merger and this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Company\'s board of directors has further (i) determined that the
Merger is advisable, fair and in the best interests of the Stockholders and
(ii) recommended that the Stockholders adopt this Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain
Stockholders have entered into a voting agreement, dated as of the Agreement,
in substantially the form set forth in Annex I hereto, pursuant to which,
among other things, each of such Stockholders has agreed, subject to the terms
of such voting agreement, to vote in favor of this Agreement and the Merger
(the "Voting Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the Company, the Seller Representatives, Parent and Merger Sub desire
to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with this Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I



THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

Section 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the MBCA,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At
the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in
accordance with the MBCA.



Section 1.02. Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (Central time) on the date two (2)
Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) at the offices of Monroe Moxness and Berg PA, 8000 Norman Center
Drive, Suite 1000, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55437-1178, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date being
the "Closing Date"). Section 1.03. Effective Time. At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall
file articles of merger meeting the requirements of Section 302A.615 of the
MBCA with the Minnesota Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective
at such time (the "Effective Time") as the articles of merger are duly filed
with and accepted by the Minnesota Secretary of State (or at such later time
as may be mutually agreed upon by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and
specified in the articles of merger).



Section 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 302A.641 of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation, all as provided under the applicable Laws of the State of
Minnesota. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary to vest in the Surviving Corporation the title to all property or
rights of Merger Sub or the Company, the authorized officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of Merger Sub or
the Company, as the case may be, to take, and shall take, any and all such
lawful action.



Section 1.05. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.



(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in the Merger to read in their
entirety as set forth in Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.



(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in the Merger to conform in their
entirety to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that all references to "Merger Sub" in the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to refer to "Ergotron") and as set
forth in Exhibit B hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law.



Section 1.06. Directors. The parties hereto shall take, and cause to be taken,
all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporation\'s articles of incorporation and the bylaws.



Section 1.07. Officers. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporation\'s articles of incorporation and the bylaws. The
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall also include any officers
designated by Parent immediately after the Effective Time.

ARTICLE II.



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; MERGER CONSIDERATION



Section 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:



(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (not including, Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and become the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to:



(i) the Per Share Portion of the Closing Consideration; and



(ii) the Per Share Portion of any Additional Merger Consideration.



The aggregate consideration to which holders of the Company Common Stock
become entitled pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) is referred to herein as the
"Common Merger Consideration" and, together with the Option Merger
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration." All shares of Company Common Stock
that have been converted in the Merger into the right to receive in accordance
with this Agreement a portion of the Common Merger Consideration shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates (each a "Certificate"), which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares other than the right to receive the
appropriate portion of the Common Merger Consideration. Any shares of Company
Common Stock then held by the Company (or held in the Company\'s treasury)
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered therefor.

(b) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time.



(c) Treatment of Company Stock Options.



(i) Each Company Stock Option then outstanding shall be accelerated in full so
that it becomes fully vested, as provided under the terms of any applicable
Company option award agreement, and shall, without any action on the part of
any holder of any Company Stock Option (an "Optionholder"), be canceled and
the Optionholder will be entitled to receive: (a) an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Portion of the
Closing Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock issuable under each Company Stock Option held by such
Optionholder, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
such Optionholder could have purchased if such Optionholder exercised such
Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Exercise Number"); and (b) an amount in cash equal to (i) the Per Share
Portion of any Additional Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the
Exercise Number for each Company Stock Option held by such Optionholder. The
aggregate consideration to which the Optionholders become entitled pursuant to
this Section 2.01(c)(i) is collectively referred to herein as the "Option
Merger Consideration."



(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Stock Option with an exercise
price per share at or above the Per Share Portion of the Common Merger
Consideration that would have been received by the holder of the Company Stock
Option had the Company Stock Option been exercised prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled without any right to receive any consideration therefor.
The Option Merger Consideration shall be reduced by any withholding or other
Taxes that may be due as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.01(c).



(iii) The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") or a
competent committee thereof shall make such amendments and adjustments to make
such determinations with respect to, and shall cause to be taken such other
actions with respect to, each Company Stock Option as are necessary to
implement the provisions of this Section 2.01(c) and shall provide to Parent
such evidence that it has done so as Parent may reasonably request.



Section 2.02. Payment Procedures.



(a) Parent to Make Purchase Price Available. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall (i) deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
in its capacity as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") in a separate fund (the
"Exchange Fund"), for the benefit of (x) the holders of Certificates and (y)
Optionholders, an amount in cash equal to the Funding Amount, (ii) instruct
the Paying Agent to deduct the Aggregate Closing Escrow Amount from the
Funding Amount and pay such Aggregate Escrow Amount out of the Exchange Fund
and into the Escrow Fund as contemplated by Section 2.07 and the Escrow
Agreement; and (iii) jointly together with the Seller Representatives instruct
the Paying Agent to deduct the Administrative Escrow Amount from the Funding
Amount and pay such Administrative Escrow Amount out of the Exchange Fund and
into the Administrative Escrow Account, and (iv) instruct the Paying Agent to
timely pay the Net Closing Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03 and,
following receipt of any Additional Merger Consideration from the Escrow Agent
and the Administrative Escrow Agent and, if applicable, Parent, to timely pay
such Additional Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03. Amounts
on deposit with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as jointly directed by Parent and the Sellers
Representatives; provided, however, that any such investment or any payment of
earnings from any such investment shall not (a) delay the receipt by the
holders of record of the Certificates of the Common Merger Consideration in
the amounts determined pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or otherwise impair such
holders\' rights hereunder, or (b) delay the receipt by the Optionholders of
the Option Merger Consideration in the amounts determined pursuant to Section
2.01(c) or otherwise impair such holders\' rights hereunder. Any interest or
income produced by such investments shall be deemed part of the Exchange Fund
and shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.03(g). The Paying Agent shall cause
the Exchange Fund to be applied promptly to making the payments provided for
in Section 2.01. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Agreement and shall be administered
pursuant to an agreement by and among the Company, Parent, Seller
Representatives and the Paying Agent in substantially the form of Annex II
(the "Paying Agent Agreement").



(b) Stock or Company Stock Options; Transfer Books. The Merger
Consideration paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.02 to the holders of record of the Certificates or the
Optionholders, as applicable, shall be deemed to have satisfied all rights
pertaining to such Certificates or cancellation of Company Stock Options, as
applicable, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective
Time, any Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in Section 2.03. (c) Merger Consideration Reduction for Stockholder Note Makers. The Paying
Agent shall deduct from the Merger Consideration due to each Stockholder Note
Maker the full amount due to the Company under each Stockholder Note
Receivable (the "Offset Amount") in order to render the applicable Stockholder
Note Receivable paid in full to the Company by the applicable Stockholder Note
Maker as of the Effective Time. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Surviving
Corporation further agree that the Offset Amount shall, for federal and state
income taxes, be reported as paid to the Company in satisfaction of each
Stockholder Note Receivable and shall not be considered waived, forgiven or
otherwise cancelled by the Company.



Section 2.03. Exchange of Shares; Cancellation of Options.



(a) On a date as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
or an earlier date agreed to by Parent, the Company and the Paying Agent, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Common Merger
Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Portion of the Common Merger
Consideration that such former holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Article II, in each case, in respect of the Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.03, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.



(b) If payment of the Common Merger Consideration is to be made to any
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in
advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Common Merger Consideration to any Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason
relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.



(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall provide notice to each Optionholder which includes (i) a
description of the treatment of the Company Stock Options in accordance with
Section 2.01(c) including the Optionholder\'s right to receive the Option
Merger Consideration and (ii) payment of the Option Merger Consideration that
such Person has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.01(c) in respect of such Optionholder\'s Company Stock Options.



(d) Thirty (30) days after the latest of (i) the Tax Survival Period, (ii)
the final distribution of all amounts from the Escrow Fund and (iii) the final
distribution of all amounts from the Administrative Escrow Account, any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Stockholders or
Optionholders shall be paid to Parent, and the Exchange Fund shall be closed
after any interest and income is paid in accordance with Section 2.03(g). Any
Stockholder or Optionholder who has not theretofore complied with this Section
2.03 or, with respect to the Optionholders, has not received their Option
Consideration, shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Common
Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock or Company Stock
Option held by such Person at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon following the
closing of the Exchange Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, none of Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, Merger Sub,
the Seller Representatives or any other Person shall be liable to any former
Stockholder or Optionholder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Paying Agent and Parent (including indemnity) and (ii) the furnishing
of a bond of indemnity in such amount reasonably acceptable to Parent, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Per Share Portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



(f) Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any Stockholder
or Optionholder such amounts as Parent, or any Affiliate thereof, Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any applicable
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent
that such amounts are properly withheld by Parent, any Affiliate thereof,
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, (i) Parent, any Affiliate thereof,
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will promptly pay such withheld
amounts to the appropriate taxing authority, and (ii) such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Stockholder or Optionholder in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
were made by Parent, any Affiliate thereof, Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent.



(g) Any interest or income in the Exchange Fund upon closing of the
Exchange Fund under Section 2.03(d) shall be paid to Parent pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.



Section 2.04. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Per Share Portion and/or the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.



Section 2.05. Purchase Price Adjustments.



(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or such later
time agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent), the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a certificate setting forth the Estimated Net
Cash at Closing and the Estimated Net Working Capital.



(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Seller Representatives:



(i) a statement setting forth the Parent\'s calculation of the Net Cash at
Closing (the "Preliminary Net Cash Statement"); and (ii) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date and prepared on a
basis consistent with prior periods, together with a statement setting forth
the amount of the Net Working Capital derived from such balance sheet (the
"Preliminary Working Capital Statement").



(c) If the Seller Representatives have any objections to the Preliminary
Net Cash Statement or the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, the Seller
Representatives shall, within thirty (30) calendar days after the Seller
Representatives\' receipt of the applicable statement, notify Parent in
writing of their objections thereto (an "Objection Notice"). In the event the
Sellers Representatives do not provide a timely Objection Notice to the
Preliminary Net Cash Statement or the Preliminary Working Capital Statement,
then the applicable statement shall be deemed to be binding and conclusive for
all purposes of this Agreement and shall thereafter be deemed to be the "Final
Net Cash Statement" or "Final Net Working Capital Statement", as applicable.



(d) If an Objection Notice is delivered to Parent in a timely fashion in
accordance with Section 2.05(c), then Parent and the Seller Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections. To the extent
such objections are resolved through such negotiations within thirty (30)
calendar days after Parent\'s receipt of the applicable Objection Notice,
Parent will revise the Preliminary Net Cash Statement or Preliminary Working
Capital Statement, as applicable, in accordance with such resolution and, as
so revised, the statement shall thereafter be deemed to be binding and
conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement and shall thereafter be deemed
to be the "Final Net Cash Statement" or "Final Net Working Capital Statement",
as applicable.



(e) If an Objection Notice is delivered to Parent in a timely fashion in
accordance with Section 2.05(c) and the parties are unable to resolve the
objections as contemplated by Section 2.05(d) within thirty (30) calendar days
after Parent\'s receipt of the applicable Objection Notice, Parent and the
Seller Representatives shall submit such remaining disagreements to Baker
Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, Minneapolis, Minnesota (the "Accounting Referee").
Parent and the Seller Representatives shall use their respective reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to resolve all remaining disagreements
with respect to the Preliminary Net Cash Statement or Preliminary Net Working
Capital Statement, as applicable, as soon as practicable, but in any event
shall direct the Accounting Referee to render a determination within sixty
(60) days after its retention. The Accounting Referee shall consider only
those items and amounts which are identified in the Objection Notice as being
items and amounts to which Parent and the Seller Representatives have been
unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Referee may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. The Accounting Referee\'s determination shall be based solely
on written materials submitted by Parent and the Seller Representatives (i.e.,
not on independent review) and on the definitions of "Net Cash at Closing" and
"Net Working Capital" (and related definitions) included herein and the
provisions of this Section 2.05. The determination of the Accounting Referee
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. Parent will revise
the Preliminary Net Cash Statement or Preliminary Working Capital Statement,
as applicable, in accordance with the determination of the Accounting Referee
and, as so revised, the statement shall thereafter be deemed to be the "Final
Net Cash Statement or "Final Net Working Capital Statement", as applicable.



(f) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee will be borne by the
parties based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
such party bears to the amount actually contested by the parties. The Seller
Representatives\' portion of such fees and expenses shall be paid from the
Administrative Escrow Account pursuant to the Administrative Escrow Agreement
and Parent\'s portion of such fees and expenses shall be paid directly by
Parent. By way of example and not by way of limitation, if a party seeks a
$70,000 upward adjustment to the calculations set forth on the Preliminary
Working Capital Statement and the Accounting Referee determines that there
should be a $40,000 upward adjustment, then such party will be responsible for
three-sevenths (3/7ths) of the fees and expenses and the other party will be
responsible for four-sevenths (4/7ths) of the fees and expenses.



(g) After the execution of an appropriate confidentiality agreement, the
books and records of Parent, Surviving Corporation, and the Seller
Representatives will be made available during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice at the principal office of the relevant party, to
the parties hereto and the Accounting Referee to the extent required to
determine the calculations required under this Section 2.05. After the
execution of an appropriate confidentiality agreement, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the resolution of any disputes under this Section
2.05, Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Seller Representatives will make
available to the other party and its representatives any final calculations or
other non-privileged working papers generated by them to support a position
which is contrary to the position taken by the other party.



(h) If, after taking into account the adjustments contemplated by Sections
2.05(b)-(e) above, the Final Consideration is equal to or greater than the
Closing Consideration (any such excess, the "Stockholder Adjustment Amount"),
then Parent and the Seller Representatives shall, within two (2) Business Days
after the Final Net Cash Statement and Final Net Working Capital Statement
have both become binding and conclusive, jointly direct the Escrow Agent to
transfer the full amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account to
the Exchange Fund for distribution in accordance with Section 2.03, and Parent
shall pay cash in an amount equal to the Stockholder Adjustment Amount to the
Paying Agent for deposit into the Exchange Fund for distribution in accordance
with Section 2.03. Interest will accrue on any amount due to be paid by Parent
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence and not so paid by
Parent to the Paying Agent within five (5) Business Days after the Final Net
Cash Statement and the Final Net Working Capital Statement have both become
binding and conclusive, at a rate equal to the lesser of eight percent (8%)
per annum or the maximum legal rate beginning on the fourth (4th) Business Day
after such statements have become binding and conclusive and continuing until
the full such amount, together with such accrued interest, is finally paid to
the Paying Agent for deposit into the Exchange Fund.



(i) If, after taking into account the adjustments contemplated by Sections
2.05(b)-(e) above, the Final Consideration is less than the Closing
Consideration (such shortfall, the "Parent Adjustment Amount"), then Parent
and the Seller Representatives shall, within two (2) Business Days after the
Final Net Cash Statement and Final Net Working Capital Statement have both
become binding and conclusive, jointly direct the Escrow Agent to transfer the
Parent Adjustment Amount from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account via
wire transfer to an account designated by Parent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement. To the extent the Parent Adjustment Amount is greater than the
amount in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, then Parent and the
Seller Representatives shall also, not later than the direction given in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, jointly direct the Escrow
Agent to transfer an amount equal to such excess from the Indemnity Escrow
Account via wire transfer to an account designated by Parent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If there is any
amount remaining in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account after the
transfer of any Parent Adjustment Amount to the Parent, Parent and the Seller
Representatives shall, not later than the direction given by them in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 2.05(i), jointly direct the
Escrow Agent to transfer to the Exchange Fund such excess amount for
distribution in accordance with Section 2.03.



(j) All transfers required under Section 2.05(h) and (i) shall be made
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Net Cash Statement and Final Net
Working Capital Statement have both become binding and conclusive in
accordance with this Section 2.05.



(k) Any payment of the Stockholder Adjustment Amount or the Parent
Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.05 (the "Purchase Price
Adjustments") shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments
to the Merger Consideration.



Section 2.06. Dissenting Shares; Escrow Limit.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time that is
held of record or beneficially owned by a Person who has not voted in favor of
the Merger and who has properly exercised and preserved and perfected
dissenters\' rights with respect to such shares in accordance with Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and has not withdrawn or lost such rights
("Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into or represent the right to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration for such shares, but holders
of such shares will instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value
of such shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA,
unless and until such Person fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
the right to the payment (through failure to preserve or protect such right or
otherwise) under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA. If, after the Effective Time,
any such Person effectively fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such right,
then each such Dissenting Share held of record or beneficially owned by such
Person shall no longer constitute a Dissenting Share and will thereupon be
treated as if it had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right
to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest. After the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, subject to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement regarding the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account, comply with
all applicable provisions of the MBCA with respect to the Dissenting Shares.
The Company will give Parent prompt notice upon receipt by the Company at any
time before the Effective Time of any written notice of intent to demand the
fair value of any shares of Company common stock under Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA and any withdrawal of any such notice. At the time of the Company
Required Vote, the Company shall identify the total number of shares of the
Company Common Stock that are Dissenting Shares (the "Dissenting Shares at
Closing"). Without limiting the rights of the holders of any Dissenting
Shares, any demands for payment of fair value for Dissenting Shares shall,
among Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company and Seller Representatives be
resolved in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, the resolution of any demands for payment of fair value for
Dissenting Shares shall be controlled (i) by the Seller Representatives to the
extent that the aggregate amount of all proposed payments in respect of
Dissenting Shares would be equal to or less than the amount available in the
Dissenting Shares Escrow Account on the Closing Date and (ii) by the Parent to
the extent that the aggregate amount of all proposed payments in respect of
Dissenting Shares would be greater than the amount available in the Dissenting
Shares Escrow Account on the Closing Date. (b) In no event shall any amount due to Parent or Surviving Corporation
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, solely with respect to the Dissenting Shares
Escrow Account, exceed the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account amount (and any
interest earned thereon).



Section 2.07. Escrow Fund.



(a) Initial Escrow Deposit. Upon receipt of the Funding Amount pursuant to
Section 2.02(a), the Paying Agent shall deposit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in
its capacity as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") in a separate escrow fund
(the "Escrow Fund") an amount in cash equal to the Aggregate Closing Escrow
Amount. The Escrow Fund shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and an escrow agreement executed by and among Parent, the Company,
Seller Representatives and the Escrow Agent and attached hereto as Annex II
(the "Escrow Agreement") which provides for the establishment, funding and
release of the following Escrow Fund sub-accounts:



(i) Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account. On the Closing Date, an
amount equal to Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) shall be deposited into the
Escrow Fund as the purchase price adjustment escrow sub-account (the "Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account") to provide for any Purchase Price
Adjustments pursuant to Section 2.05;



(ii) Dissenting Shares Escrow Account. On the Closing Date, an amount equal
to the product of (x) the Dissenting Shares at Closing and (y) the Dissenting
Shares Per Share Portion shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund as the
dissenting shares escrow sub-account (the "Dissenting Shares Escrow Account")
to provide for amounts payable for Dissenting Shares under Section 2.06(a),
subject to the limitations of Section 2.06(b); and



(iii) Indemnity Escrow Account. On the Closing Date, an amount equal to
Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000) shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund
as the indemnity escrow sub-account (the "Indemnity Escrow Account") to
provide for amounts payable for Indemnifiable Losses of Purchaser Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Article VII and Article VIII.



(b) Subsequent Escrow Deposit. Promptly following receipt of any amount
constituting a Company Tax Refund, Parent shall pay the lesser of (i) the
actual amount of such Tax Refund received by the Surviving Corporation and
(ii) Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) to the Escrow Agent for deposit into
the Indemnity Escrow Account. To the extent the Company Tax Refund received by
the Surviving Corporation exceeds Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000), Parent
shall pay such excess amount to the Paying Agent for deposit into the Exchange
Fund for distribution in accordance with Section 2.03. Parent shall provide
written notice to the Seller Representatives of the filing of the Surviving
Corporation\'s Tax Return and timely respond to all reasonable inquiries by
the Seller Representatives regarding the status of the pending refunds and
calculation of the Company Tax Refund.



Section 2.08. Appointment of Seller Representatives; Administrative Escrow
Fund.



(a) Appointment of Seller Representatives. As a term of the Merger, the
Company irrevocably appoints the Seller Representatives as of the Effective
Time, and each of the Seller Representatives accepts such appointment, to act
as representatives, agents, proxies, and attorneys-in-fact for all purposes under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and the Administrative Escrow
Agreement for and on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders. The Seller
Representatives shall have the rights and responsibilities set forth in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and the
Administrative Escrow Agreement, including without limitation, the power and
authority, for and on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders, to: (i)
consummate, in the capacity of Seller Representatives, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) negotiate, settle, compromise and
authorize payments in respect of claims (including claims for Indemnifiable
Losses) under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement, the Administrative Escrow Agreement and such other agreements,
certificates, instruments, and documents contemplated by this Agreement or
executed or delivered in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) execute and
deliver, in the capacity as Seller Representatives, the Escrow Agreement, the
Paying Agent Agreement, the Administrative Escrow Agreement or any of the
other agreements, certificates, instruments, and documents contemplated by any
such agreements, and any amendment or waiver thereto, and (iv) undertake such
other actions as may be necessary or desirable, in the discretion of the
Seller Representatives, to fulfill the purposes and duties associated with the
roles and functions of the Sellers Representatives as set forth in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, the
Administrative Escrow Agreement and any other agreements, certificates,
instruments, and documents contemplated by this Agreement or executed or
delivered in connection herewith or therewith. Parent, Surviving Corporation
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge the appointment of the Seller
Representatives and the terms of such appointment in accordance with this
Section 2.08.



(b) Action by Seller Representatives/Reliance. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely without independent inquiry on
any written notice given jointly and consistently to Parent by both Seller
Representatives with respect to any action or determination of the Seller
Representatives, and until Parent is given any such joint and consistent
written notice, the Seller Representatives shall not be deemed to have taken
any action or made any determination for any purpose; provided, however, that
the Seller Representatives may jointly designate in written notice to Parent
one of the Seller Representatives to act for the Seller Representatives for
all purposes, and Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely without independent inquiry upon any written notice given to
Parent by such designated Seller Representative with respect to any action or
determination of the Seller Representatives until such time as Parent is given
a subsequent written notice by the non-designated Seller Representative (or
any successor of such non-designated Seller Representative as contemplated by
Section 2.08(f)) instructing Parent that the prior permission to rely on
written notices from such designated Seller Representative is no longer
effective. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully
protected in relying and acting on any written notices given in accordance
with the immediately prior sentence.



(c) Deposit of Administrative Escrow Amount. At the Effective Time and
consistent with clause (iii) of the first sentence of Section 2.02(a), the
Seller Representatives shall instruct the Paying Agent to deduct the
Administrative Escrow Amount from the Funding Amount and pay such
Administrative Escrow Amount out of the Exchange Fund and into a separate
escrow account (the "Administrative Escrow Account") with Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. in its capacity as administrative escrow agent (the "Administrative Escrow Agent"), to be held and administered in accordance with
that certain administrative escrow agreement executed by Seller
Representatives and Administrative Escrow Agent (the "Administrative Escrow
Agreement"). Parent, the Company, Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub agree
that the Administrative Escrow Account is for the sole benefit of the Seller
Representatives, the Stockholders and Optionholders. Each of Parent, Company,
Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub waive any and all right, title and
interest in and to the Administrative Escrow Account.



(d) Purpose. The Company agrees that the Administrative Escrow Account is a
material inducement to the Seller Representatives\' agreement to execute this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and such other
agreements, certificates, instruments, and documents contemplated by such
agreements or executed or delivered in connection therewith and to perform the
duties of Seller Representatives pursuant to the terms thereof. The Company
further agrees that pursuant to the Administrative Escrow Agreement, each
Stockholder and Optionholder shall (i) bear all fees, expenses and other costs
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees) incurred by the Seller Representatives
in connection with the exercise of the Seller Representatives duties and
obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement and the Administrative Escrow Agreement and such other agreements,
certificates, instruments, and documents contemplated by any such agreements,
and (ii) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller Representatives
against any and all losses incurred by Seller Representatives in connection
with the performance of their duties and obligations (unless such loss shall
have been finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of the Seller Representatives); provided,
however, in all events, the obligations of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders pursuant to this Section 2.08(d) shall be payable solely from
the Administrative Escrow Account. The Seller Representatives shall not be
entitled to any indemnification, reimbursement of expenses or other
protections from Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and the
Sellers Representatives agree not to seek any such indemnification,
reimbursement or other protection.



(e) Advice of Counsel; Fees, Costs and Expenses. The Seller Representatives
shall be entitled to rely on and shall not be liable to the Stockholders or
Optionholders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Seller
Representatives in accordance with the advice of counsel or other
professionals retained or consulted by the Seller Representatives. Seller
Representatives shall be paid by the Administrative Escrow Account reasonable
compensation for services rendered by the Seller Representatives pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and such
other agreements, certificates, instruments, and documents contemplated by
such agreements or executed or delivered in connection therewith. Seller
Representatives compensation shall be determined on a time and expense basis,
at rates not greater than each of Seller Representatives then current
published hourly consulting or billable rates. Seller Representatives shall be
reimbursed by the Administrative Escrow Account for any and all compensation
(fees, expenses and other costs) paid and/or reimbursed to counsel,
accountants and/or other professionals. The Company acknowledges that counsel
and professionals retained by the Seller Representatives may include parties
in which Seller Representatives have a material financial interest. Seller
Representatives may perform any and all of their duties with the assistance of
agents, representatives, attorneys, custodians, and/or nominees and the
Company acknowledges that the fees, costs and expenses of such parties will reduce the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the
Stockholders and Optionholders.



(f) Resignation, Incapacity and Successors. A Seller Representative may
resign by furnishing written notice of his, her or its resignation to the
Parent, Surviving Corporation, Escrow Agent and Administrative Escrow Agent.
Any such resignation shall be effective thirty (30) days after the delivery of
such notice or upon the earlier appointment of a successor. Each such
resigning Seller Representative shall have the right to designate his, her or
its successor by including such designation in such resigning Seller
Representative\'s notice of resignation given in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence; provided that if the resigning Seller
Representative fails to appoint a successor, the remaining Seller
Representative shall appoint a successor by providing written notice thereof
to the Parent, Surviving Corporation, Escrow Agent and Administrative Escrow
Agent. In the event of the death or incapacity of a Seller Representative, the
remaining Seller Representative shall appoint a successor by providing written
notice thereof to the Parent, Surviving Corporation, Escrow Agent and
Administrative Escrow Agent. In the event that both of the Seller
Representatives have vacated the position of Seller Representative by reason
of resignation, death or incapacity, without naming a successor, the then
acting President of Monroe Moxness Berg PA shall designate one or more persons
to serve as the Seller Representative(s) by providing written notice thereof
to the Parent, Surviving Corporation, Escrow Agent and Administrative Escrow
Agent. In the event of the appointment of any successor as contemplated by the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph, such successor shall for all purposes
be a Seller Representative (and without limiting the foregoing, for purposes
of Section 2.08(b), Parent, Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on written instructions given by such successor and shall no
longer be entitled to rely on any written instructions given by any resigned
Seller Representative).

reference to the section of this Agreement to which the information stated in
such Company Disclosure Schedule relates; provided that (i) disclosure in any
section of such Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable or relevant to such other Section and (ii) the mere inclusion of an
item in such Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation
or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
currently conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent in the Dataroom
true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or other
applicable governing documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as
currently in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

liability company or other entity, as the case may be, under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (iii)
has all requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now

stock and record and beneficial owners of such capital stock for each
Subsidiary of the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.02(b) of the

purchase, sale, registration or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of any Subsidiary of the Company or any securities

stock or any other equity security of any such Subsidiary.



(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no Indebtedness except as set

delivered to Parent in the Dataroom true and complete copies of all agreements
evidencing any Indebtedness. Except as set forth on Section 3.02(c) of the

Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except by reason
of the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.



(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger), nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of the similar governing
documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the consents,
approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.04 are duly obtained or made,

instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound or affected, except, solely in the case of clause (ii) above, for such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or other events which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

by the Company of this Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the

of merger with respect to the Merger with the Minnesota Secretary of State,
(c) the consents and approvals set forth on Section 3.04 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (d) consents or approvals of third Persons, the

result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



Section 3.05. Financial Statements. (a) The Company has delivered to Parent copies of the following:



(i) the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 (the "Audited Balance Sheet" and the date

2007, and the related audited consolidated statements of income, cash flow and
changes in stockholders\' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal years then ended, accompanied by any notes thereto and the reports of
the Company\'s independent accountants with respect thereto (collectively, the
"Audited Financials"); and



(ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2010 (the "Most Recent Balance Sheet" and the
date thereof, the "Most Recent Balance Sheet Date"), and the related unaudited
consolidated statement of income and cash flow of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the nine (9) months then ended (the "Interim Financials" and,
together with the Audited Financials, the "Financials").



(b) Except as disclosed on Section 3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Financials (including any notes thereto) (i) were prepared in
accordance with the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied
(subject, in the case of the unaudited Financials, to normal year-end audit
adjustments, the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate,
be materially adverse, and the absence of footnote disclosure that if
presented, would not differ materially from those included in the Audited
Financials) and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and changes in financial position for the respective
periods covered thereby.



(c) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability for (i) replacement or repair of any product designed, manufactured,
sold, repaired, reconfigured or placed in the stream of commerce by the

any Product or (ii) claims with respect to damaged or defective Products, in
each case subject only to wear and tear in the Ordinary Course of Business and
reserves (which in all cases are classified as short term liabilities) for
warranty claims related to the Products and the Company\'s workmanship as set
forth on the face of the Most Recent Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto) and thereafter adjusted for the passage of time in accordance with
the past customs and practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Warranty Reserves"). The Warranty Reserves are on the date hereof adequate to
address all claims with respect to damaged or defective Products and will be
adequate to address all claims with respect to damaged or defective Products
as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date.



(d) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom) except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect on the
system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 3.05(d). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains
disclosure controls and procedures; such financial disclosure controls and
procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to

forth in Section 3.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the consummation

nor has any event occurred which (with the giving of notice or the passage of
time, or both) would constitute a default or result in or permit the
repossession, acceleration of any obligation under, or termination of any of
the Company Leases, in each case as a result of any action or inaction by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other party to any Company Lease; nor, to the Knowledge of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, is there any default under any ground lease, prime lease,

to any real property, which would ultimately result in a repossession under or
termination of any of the Company Leases or impair any right of the Company or
its Subsidiaries under any Company Lease;

otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, any of their interests in any of

reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as are prudent in
accordance with customary industry practice in the industries in which the

expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such policy is
outstanding and in full force and effect (other than due to the ordinary
expiration of the term thereof). All premiums and other payments due under any
such policy have been paid. Section 3.17. Environmental Liability. Except in each case as would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect:



(a) The operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been

Subsidiaries incurring any material Liability pursuant to any Environmental
Law;



(d) No Release of Hazardous Substances has occurred at, under, or from any
real property now or currently owned, leased or operated by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, which such Release reasonably could be expected to give

pursuant to Environmental Laws;



(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Hazardous Substances generated by

Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' compliance with Environmental Laws.

inventions, know-how, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark

(b) Section 3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all material licenses, agreements, authorizations
and/or permissions pursuant to which the Company or its Subsidiaries uses any
one or more items of intellectual property of a third Person or pursuant to
which the Company or its Subsidiaries has granted any intellectual property
rights to a third Person (each, a "License Agreement"), other than off-the-
shelf software licenses that are commercially available to the public.
Complete unredacted and accurate copies of the License Agreements have been
made available by the Company to Parent in the Dataroom. Except as provided in
the License Agreements, the Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to
any contractual obligation that restricts the use, transfer, delivery or
licensing of the Intellectual Property Rights. Except as provided in the
License Agreements, the Company has not granted, licensed or conveyed to any
third Person, pursuant to any contractual obligation or other arrangement, any
license, sub-license, or other right, title or interest in, to or under any
intellectual property rights. Except as disclosed in the License Agreements:
(i) there are no outstanding obligations to pay any material amounts or
provide other material consideration to any other person in connection with
any Intellectual Property Rights, and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries
are not currently party to any contractual obligation to indemnify any other

effect, and no party thereto is in breach thereof.



(c) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has received written notice
asserting that any Intellectual Property Right used by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or that the business conducted by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, violates or infringes the rights of any third Person, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries are not aware of any reasonable basis for any
such assertion. There is no claim, action or proceeding being made or brought
against, or to the Knowledge of the Company, being threatened against, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries asserting that any of the Intellectual
Property Rights, or products or services offered by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any
intellectual property rights of a third Person, nor to the Knowledge of the
Company is there any reasonable basis for any such assertion. The manufacture,
use, sale, offer for sale and importation of the products and services
currently marketed by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the products and
services currently contemplated for development or commercialization by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise

the Intellectual Property Rights, and the Company and its Subsidiaries are not
aware of any basis for any such assertion. No third Person has challenged, is
challenging or is threatening to challenge the right, title or interest of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in, to or under Intellectual Property Rights, or
the validity, enforceability, claim construction (with respect to patents), or
the scope of claims (with respect to applications for patents, other than as
initiated by a Governmental Entity in the normal course of patent
prosecution), of any patents or patent applications of the Intellectual
Property Rights, or the validity, scope, priority or rights of use of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in any trademarks or trademark registrations or
applications.



(e) All of the Intellectual Property Rights are valid, enforceable, and
free and clear of any Liens and other rights of a third Person (other than
Permitted Liens and rights of third Persons set forth in the License
Agreements). No action has been taken, or has failed to be taken, that
reasonably would be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation,
forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or unenforceability of any of the
Intellectual Property Rights (including failure to pay required fees
associated with registrations or maintenance of the Intellectual Property
Rights; failure to disclose any known material prior art in connection with
the prosecution of patent applications; or failure to make timely post-
registration filing of affidavits of use and incontestability and renewal
applications in the case of registered trademarks); and no material trade
secret of Company or its Subsidiaries has been disclosed or authorized to be
disclosed to any third Person not subject to confidentiality obligations to
the Company or its Subsidiaries.



(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all commercially reasonable
measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all of the
Intellectual Property Rights and proprietary data and information of the

commit to undertake any of the foregoing in the future;

conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their
respective businesses, assets and operations.

consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and
Governmental Entities.

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.05 shall be deemed to prevent the Company or
the Company Board from taking any action they are permitted or required to
take under, and in compliance with, Section 5.10 or are required to take under
applicable Law.



Section 5.06. Stockholder Approval. The Company shall take all necessary
action in accordance with the MBCA and the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of the Stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting"), as promptly

Company Recommendation Change. The Company will provide Parent with a draft of
the Proxy Statement at least five (5) days prior to the mailing thereof and

Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.10, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from the Stockholders proxies in favor of the

Section 5.07. Further Actions.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts (unless, with respect to
any action, another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein)
to satisfy the conditions to the Company\'s obligations to, and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (unless, with respect to any action,
another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein) to satisfy

(iii) the taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third Person which is required to be
obtained by such party or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, in the case of the Company, obtaining the
consents and approvals from the third Persons listed on Section 3.04 of the

will each bear its own fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with
any HSR Act filings or other such competition filings and submissions which
may be required by such party for the consummation of the Merger pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent will pay the HSR Filing Fee.



(b) Parent agrees to take any and all commercially reasonable steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust
or competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to
enable the parties hereto to consummate the Merger as soon as practicable,
including committing to and/or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such of the shares of Company
Common Stock, or its or the Company\'s or their respective Subsidiaries\'
assets, as are required to be divested or entering into such other
arrangements as are required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
delaying the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not require Parent to agree or commit to or otherwise consent to any of the following: (i) the sale or other disposition by Parent
of any of its direct or indirect interest in Omni Mount Systems, Inc. ("Omni
Mount") or any of the Subsidiaries of Omni Mount, (ii) the sale or other
disposition of any assets of Omni Mount or any Subsidiaries of Omni Mount or
(iii) any other arrangement which would reduce the direct or indirect
ownership of Parent in, or the direct control of Parent over the businesses or
assets of, Omni Mount or any of the Subsidiaries of Omni Mount.



(c) Nothing in this Section 5.07 shall be deemed to prevent the Company or
the Company Board from taking any action they are permitted or required to
take under, and in compliance with, Section 5.10 or are required to take under
applicable Law.



Section 5.08. Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.



(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) give those
employees who are, as of the Effective Time, employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation (collectively, the "Parent Plans") for such
Continuing Employees\' service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan that
such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time,
except to the extent the employee was subject to such limitations, conditions,
exclusions and waiting period prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) provide
credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments and deductibles for the
remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs;
provided, however, that no such service shall be recognized to the extent such
recognition would result in the duplication of benefits.



(b) From and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2011, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
provide to each Continuing Employee compensation and benefit arrangements
(excluding equity-based compensation) that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefit arrangements (excluding equity-based
compensation) that were provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation in any event to provide cash compensation for 2011 to
the Company\'s key management as provided in the Company\'s 2011 budget for
salaries, bonuses and commissions as set forth on Exhibit B to the Side
Letter. Nothing herein shall be construed to require Parent to extend
eligibility to participate to any Continuing Employee in any particular Parent
Plan. Nothing herein or in Section 5.08(a) above shall be construed to require
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to extend to any Continuing Employee
eligibility to participate in any Parent Plan existing prior to the Effective
Time or in any other particular Parent Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) from and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2012, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide to
each Continuing Employee vacation and holiday benefit arrangements that are no
less favorable than the vacation and holiday benefit arrangements that were
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) during each year after December 31, 2012, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide to each
Continuing Employee vacation and holiday benefit arrangements that are no less favorable than the vacation and holiday benefit arrangements provided to the
U.S. employees of any U.S. based Subsidiary of the Company during such year.



(c) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employees, present or former
employees or directors, consultants or independent contractors of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries),
other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to
the matters provided for in this Section 5.08) under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 5.08 or
elsewhere in the Agreement shall be construed to prevent, from and after the
Effective Time, the termination of employment of any individual Continuing
Employee or, subject to the provisions of Section 5.08(a), any change in the
employee benefits available to any Continuing Employee or the amendment or
termination of any particular plan in accordance with its terms. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.08 or elsewhere in the Agreement shall be treated
as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan.



Section 5.09. Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who served as a director and/or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "DO Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by Minnesota law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection
with any DO Claim and any judgments, fines (including excise taxes), penalties
and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments,
fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the DO Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by Minnesota law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any DO Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with
respect to or otherwise participating in any DO Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such DO Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the DO Indemnified Party of any DO Expenses incurred by such DO Indemnified
Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but in the case of advancement of DO Expenses upon
receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable Law, from such
DO Indemnified Party to repay such advanced DO Expenses if it is determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such DO Indemnified
Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such DO
Expenses. The indemnification and advancement obligations of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 5.09(a) shall extend only to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any DO Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and any DO Claim relating thereto) and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue
as to an individual who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company
or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit
of such individual\'s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.
In connection with any determination as to whether the DO Indemnified Parties
are entitled to the benefits of this Section 5.09, the burden of proof shall
be on Parent and the Surviving Corporation to establish that a DO Indemnified not so entitled.



(b) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
Section 5.09, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions
of, any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any DO Indemnified Party providing
for the indemnification of such DO Indemnified Party.



(c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
Section 5.09, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and all
limitations of liability existing in favor of the DO Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Company\'s articles of incorporation or bylaws or in the
corresponding documents of any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto.



(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be (including Parent\'s ultimate parent entity, if applicable), assume all
of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
Section 5.09.



(e) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
for the benefit of DO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions relating to the
approval of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby). Such insurance shall have at least the same coverage amounts and
provide for terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not materially
less advantageous to such directors and officers of the Company than the terms
and conditions of the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy ("Existing Policy") from reputable carriers having a rating
comparable to the Company\'s current carrier; provided, however, that (i)
Parent shall only be obligated to pay a premium for any such policy of up to
two hundred percent (200%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
its Existing Policy and (ii) if the premium would be in excess of such amount,
Parent shall cause to be purchased the maximum amount of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance coverage reasonably available that may be
purchased for such maximum premium amount.



(f) The provisions of this Section 5.09 shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each DO Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
under this Agreement, by contract or otherwise. Following the Effective Time,
the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.09
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any DO Indemnified Party under this Section 5.09 without the
consent of such affected DO Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.09.



Section 5.10. No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, and shall
cause their respective officers, directors, representatives and agents
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, "Company Representatives") to, (i)
immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
third Person that may be ongoing with respect to any actual or potential
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) with respect to parties with whom discussions
have been terminated, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the return or the destruction of, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable confidentiality agreement, confidential information previously
furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or Company Representatives. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any
Company Representative to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish or disclose to any
third Person non-public information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) negotiate or engage in discussions with any third Person with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than to advise such Person of the Company\'s
obligations under this Section 5.10) or (iv) enter into, or approve or
recommend, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (v) take any action to make
the provisions of any Takeover Statute inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than to the extent the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, that failure to take any actions under clause (v)of this
sentence would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the directors\'
fiduciary duty under applicable Law and is necessary to facilitate an
Acquisition Proposal in compliance with this Section 5.10), or (vi) propose to
do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that at any time prior to
obtaining approval of the Merger by the Company Required Vote (but not
thereafter), in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was
not solicited by the Company or any Company Representatives if (x) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duty under applicable Law, then
the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its officers,
directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors,
agents and other representatives), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with, and provide draft documents and agreements to, the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if (prior to furnishing
such information to, or entering into such discussions or negotiations with,
such Person) the Company (1) provides reasonable prior notice orally, and in
writing to Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person (but excluding the
identity of such Person), (2) provides Parent with all information to be
provided to such Person which Parent has not previously been provided at the
same time as or as soon as reasonably practicable following the time such
information is provided to such Person (which requirement may be satisfied by
posting such information to an electronic data room to which Parent has access
and providing prompt notice to Parent of such posting, which notice may
consist of email or similar electronic message generated automatically by the
host of such electronic data room), and (3) receives from such Person an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement prior to furnishing any
information to such Person (or any of its representatives). In addition, the
Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-public information to
any competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
connection with any actions contemplated by this Section 5.10, except in a
manner reasonably designed to protect the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates if no
Alternative Acquisition Agreement is agreed to with such Person.



(b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.10(b), neither the Company Board
or any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, withhold or modify, or
propose to withdraw, qualify, withhold or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose
to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (v) take any other action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or otherwise
take any action inconsistent with the Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, at any time prior to obtaining approval of the Merger by
the Company Required Vote, the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the
failure to do so would violate its fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under
applicable Law, then the Company Board may withdraw, modify, or change in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (a "Company
Recommendation Change"); provided, however, that if any such action is in
response to a Superior Proposal (that was not solicited in breach of this
Section 5.10) as determined by the Company Board in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, prior to making
any Company Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.01(d), the Company shall, in all such cases, provide Parent
with at least three (3) Business Days advance written notice (such period, the
"Notice Period"), advising Parent of its intention to make a Company
Recommendation Change or to terminate the Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (ii) provide Parent in writing
the identity of such Person making such Superior Proposal and an unredacted
copy of such Superior Proposal, and (iii) discuss with Parent, to the extent
Parent wishes to discuss, any proposed changes by Parent to the terms of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal and following the Notice Period, and taking into account any revised
proposal made by Parent since the commencement of the Notice Period,
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors that the Company Board is required to make a Company
Recommendation Change in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, and if it is in
connection with a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal. In the event of any material change to the material terms of such
Superior Proposal (any change in price shall be deemed a material change of a
material term), the Company Board shall deliver to Parent an additional notice
and shall comply with this Section 5.10(b) with respect to such new notice,
except that if the only material change is a change in price, then the
deadline for such new written notice shall be two (2) Business Days (rather
than the three (3) Business Days otherwise contemplated by this Section
5.10(b)). None of the Company Board, any committee thereof or the Company
shall enter into any binding agreement with any Person to limit or not provide
prior notice to Parent of its intent to make a Company Recommendation Change
or to terminate this Agreement in response to any Superior Proposal.



Section 5.11. Standstill. Until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
(a) purchase any shares of Company Common Stock or any security of the Company
that is convertible into Company Common Stock in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions or (b) form, join or in any way participate
in a group in connection with any of the foregoing or (c) prior to the
termination of this Agreement, commence a tender offer or exchange offer at a
price per share below the Merger Consideration. Section 5.12. Notification of Certain Events. The Company will notify Parent
and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub will notify the Company, promptly of
(a) any written communications from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided that the foregoing shall not apply in
respect of any immaterial consents, (b) any written communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than any such communication from a Governmental Entity in its
capacity as a counterparty to any contract with the Company thereof), (c) any
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims or actions
commenced against the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable, that are related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (d) any event, change or effect between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause
the conditions set forth in Sections 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) of this Agreement (in
the case of the Company) or Sections 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) of this Agreement (in
the case of Parent and its Subsidiaries).



Section 5.13. Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective
boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
render such Takeover Statute or similar statute or regulation inapplicable to
the foregoing.



Section 5.14. Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the Company or Merger Sub, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such necessary
action.



Section 5.15. Cooperation with Financing. If Parent determines to seek
financing (through loans from financial institutions or otherwise) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (each a "Parent
Financing"), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
directors, officers, employees, accountants, agents, advisors and other
representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection therewith
and use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
requested by Parent in connection therewith (in each case, at Parent\'s
expense), including (a) participating in marketing efforts (including lender
meetings and calls) and due diligence sessions; (b) assisting Parent in its
preparation bank books, confidential information memoranda or similar
documents; (c) delivering to Parent information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in connection with the Parent
Financing, including, at the request of Parent, delivery within fifteen (15)
days of the close of each fiscal month, monthly financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including a balance sheet and income statement);
(d) facilitating the pledge and perfection of liens securing the Parent
Financing; and (e) taking all other actions as are reasonably requested by
Parent to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions to
obtaining the Parent Financing; provided, however, that the cooperation and
actions required by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.15 shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ordinary course operation of the Company or
its Subsidiaries\' businesses.



Section 5.16. Payoff Letters and Lien Releases, etc. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent customary payoff letters and lien
release documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its counsel
relating to the repayment of all Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries scheduled on Section 3.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and the termination of all Liens on any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries securing any such Indebtedness.



Section 5.17. Ancillary Agreements. On the Closing Date, Parent, the Company
and the Seller Representatives shall each enter into the Escrow Agreement with
the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent Agreement with the Paying Agent.



Section 5.18. Non-Competition Agreements. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company shall not terminate, amend, rescind or otherwise modify
any of the non-competition agreements executed by and between the Company and
certain managers of the Company on or prior to the date hereof in connection
with the Special Bonus Plan.

provided, however, Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be indemnified
under this Article VII for any, and Indemnifiable Losses shall not include
any, loss, liability, action, cause of action, cost, damage, Tax or expense,
whether or not arising out of third party claims (including interest,

adjustment under or from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account or
Dissenting Shares Escrow Account provided for in the Escrow Agreement and have
been fully satisfied as a result of such adjustment; provided, further, that
the foregoing proviso shall not limit claims for breach of the representation
and warranty set forth in Section 3.02(d).

(b) No claim may be made or suit instituted by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(ii) unless a written
notice (a "Claim Notice") asserting a claim or potential claim is provided to
the Seller Representatives:



(i) during the Standard Survival Period, except as set forth in Sections

(ii) during the Extended Survival Period, in the case of any claim or suit

relevant sections of the Merger Agreement, the parties involved in the claim
or potential claim, and a good faith estimate of the amount of the claim or
potential claim (if such claim or potential claim may be reasonably estimated
at such time).



Section 7.04. Limitations on Indemnification.



(a) Notwithstanding the indemnification described in Section 7.03, the Representatives shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in respect of any matter referred to in Section 7.03(a)(ii) unless the
aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable Losses suffered by Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for matters referred to in Section 7.03(a)(ii) exceeds $3,000,000 (the
"Basket"), in which case such Seller Representatives shall be liable for such
Indemnifiable Losses only for amounts in excess of the Basket; provided,
however, that the foregoing Basket limitations contained in this Section
7.04(a) will not apply to claims for indemnification pursuant to Section
7.03(a)(ii) in respect of breaches of, or inaccuracies in, the representations
and warranties contained in the Specified Representations (or as such
Specified Representations are repeated or confirmed in the certificate
delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 6.02(a)) or any representations or
warranties related to Taxes or any Indemnifiable Tax Loss. In no event shall
Seller Representatives be required to indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties
in respect of Indemnifiable Losses suffered by Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under this Article VII other than from amounts which are part of the Indemnity
Escrow Account (the "Indemnity Limit").



(b) Seller Representatives shall not be liable to a Purchaser Indemnified
Party hereunder for any Indemnifiable Losses or claim(s) for (i) punitive
damages, (ii) incidental, consequential, or special damages, (iii) exemplary
damages, or (iv) similar damages (other than damages of the type described in
any of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) which are owed by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party Claim).



(c) For purposes of determining the amount of Indemnifiable Losses, such
amount shall be reduced by the amount of all insurance policy proceeds
actually received by or paid on behalf of any of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or its Affiliates (net of any increase to such insurance policy
premiums as a result thereof). Additionally, there shall be deducted from the
amount of the Indemnifiable Loss any indemnification, contribution, or other
similar payment actually recovered by any such Purchaser Indemnified Party
from any third party.



(d) Any amount due under this Article VII shall be reduced for any Tax
benefits of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties actually realized. Any payment
hereunder shall be reduced to reflect any such net Tax benefit only after any
such Purchaser Indemnified Party has actually realized such benefit. For
purposes of this Agreement a Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be deemed to
have "actually realized" a net Tax benefit to the extent that, and at such
time as, the amount of Taxes required to be paid by the Purchaser Indemnified
Party is reduced below the amount of Taxes that it would have been required to
pay but for deductibility of such Indemnifiable Losses.



Section 7.05. Defense of Claims.



(a) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or
commencement of any claim by a third party against such Purchaser Indemnified
Party with respect to which Seller Representatives are obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement (the "Third Party Claim"), the Purchaser
Indemnified Party will give such Seller Representatives reasonably prompt
written notice thereof, but in any event not later than fifteen (15) calendar
days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. Such notice by
the Purchaser Indemnified Party will describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, will include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Indemnifiable Losses that have been or may be sustained by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party. The Seller Representatives will have the right to
participate in or, by giving written notice to the Purchaser Indemnified
Party, to assume and control the defense of any Third Party Claim at such Seller Representatives\' own expense and by such
Seller Representatives\' own counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party); provided that if the Seller Representatives assume and
control the defense of any Third Party Claim the Seller Representatives\'
expenses including legal expenses shall be paid directly by, or reimbursed by,
the Escrow Agent from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, and the Purchaser Indemnified Party will have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ its own separate counsel at
its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Representatives
will not have the right to assume and control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, and will promptly reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Party out of the
Indemnity Escrow Account for all reasonable costs and expenses of defending
against such Third Party Claim (including reasonable costs and expenses of
counsel), if (1) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; (2) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Purchaser Indemnified Party; (3) the Purchaser Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a
conflict of interest between the Seller Representatives and the Purchaser
Indemnified Party; (4) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any audit, proceeding or other action relating to an
Indemnifiable Tax Loss or other matter relating to Taxes, or (5) the Purchaser
Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the total losses, damages, costs,
expenses, and other liabilities relating to the claim could exceed two (2)
times the maximum amount that the Purchaser Indemnified Party could then be
entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of Section 7.03.



(b) If, within thirty (30) calendar days after giving notice of a Third
Party Claim to the Seller Representatives for which the Seller Representatives
have the right to assume and control the defense pursuant to Section 7.05(a),
a Purchaser Indemnified Party receives written notice from the Seller
Representatives that the Seller Representatives have elected to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim as provided in the penultimate sentence of
Section 7.05(a), the Seller Representatives will not be liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof (but will be liable for expenses incurred
prior thereto which shall be promptly reimbursed out of the Indemnity Escrow
Account); provided, however, that if the Seller Representatives fail to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend such Third Party Claim appropriately
within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving written notice from the
Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Purchaser Indemnified Party may assume its
own defense, and the Seller Representatives will be liable for all reasonable
costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith until such time as
the Seller Representatives begin taking reasonable steps necessary to defend
such Third Party Claim appropriately. Without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Seller Representatives will not enter into
any settlement of any Third Party Claim which would lead to liability or
create any financial or other obligation on the part of such Purchaser
Indemnified Party for which such Purchaser Indemnified Party is not entitled
to full and complete indemnification hereunder. A Purchaser Indemnified Party
may not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Seller Representatives (such consent to be withheld or delayed
only for a good faith reason).



(c) Any claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party on account of an
Indemnifiable Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") will be asserted by giving the Seller Representatives reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than fifteen (15)
calendar days after the Purchaser Indemnified Party has determined to assert
such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Purchaser Indemnified Party will
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party. The Seller Representatives will have a period of thirty
(30) calendar days within which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If
the Seller Representatives do not so respond within such thirty (30) calendar
day period, the Seller Representatives will be deemed to have rejected such
claim, in which event the Purchaser Indemnified Party will be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to the Purchaser Indemnified Party on the
terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.



(d) A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information
in any notice as provided in Sections 7.05(a), 7.05(b) or 7.05(c) will not
affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except and only to the
extent that, as a result of such failure, any party which was entitled to
receive such notice was actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.



Section 7.06. Knowledge and Investigation. The right of any Purchaser
Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII or Article
VIII will not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance of or compliance
with any covenant or agreement or any other matter referred to in Section
7.03(a). The waiver of any condition contained in this Agreement based on the
breach of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right of
any Purchaser Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to this Article
VII or Article VIII based on such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.



ARTICLE VIII.



Tax Matters



Section 8.01. Tax Indemnification. 2Subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of Article VII, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be
indemnified against and held harmless from and against, any loss, claim,
liability, expense, or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-
payment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the
Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an

or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract (other than customary tax
indemnifications contained in commercial lease agreements) or pursuant to any
law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing, and (iv) any Taxes attributable to any Subpart F
income, Section 956 amount or Section 1293 income (as described in the Code)
arising from actions or events occurring on or before the Closing Date (each,

shall include any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage to the
extent such items or amounts are subject to adjustment under or from the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account provided for in the Escrow Agreement
and have been fully satisfied as a result of such adjustment.



Section 8.02. Straddle Period. 2In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any ad valorem or
similar Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period and the amount of other Taxes (including, without limitation,
income, sales, use, gross receipts and value added Taxes) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership, other pass-through entity or any "controlled
foreign corporation" in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time).



Section 8.03. Tax Returns.



(a) The Seller Representatives shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes.



(b) Any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including
with respect to estimated Taxes, that are due prior to the Closing Date shall
be filed by the Company, provided that (i) the Company agrees to provide the
Parent with a copy of such Tax Return no later than ten (10) business days
prior to the due date of such Tax Return and all workpapers and calculations
used in the preparation of such Tax Return, (ii) the Company shall incorporate
any reasonable changes to such Tax Return proposed by the Parent, including,
but not limited to, changes intended to ensure that the expected amount of the
Company Tax Refund is deposited pursuant to Section 2.07(b) and (iii) any such
Tax Return shall not be filed without the Parent\'s consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.



(c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) below, all Tax Returns of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, and any Subsidiaries thereof that are due
on or after the Closing Date shall be prepared (or caused to be prepared) and
filed by the Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable, including any
claims for refund that are the subject of the Company Tax Refund.



(d) Parent and the Seller Representatives further agree, upon request, to
provide the other Party with all information that either Party may be required
to report pursuant to Code §6043, or Code §6043A, or Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

Fee shall be reduced by any amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Law.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company\'s right to receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(v) in the circumstance where the Reverse
Termination Fee is owed pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(v) shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and
all other Company Parties (including the holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Stock Options) against any Parent Party for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that
Parent shall also be obligated to the Company under Section 9.02(e) and for
its expense reimbursement obligations contained in Section 5.15).



Parent\'s right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee or
the Parent Expenses pursuant to Section 9.02(a) shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against any Company Party in the
event of a termination of this Agreement, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Company Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby (except that the Company shall also be obligated to Parent and Merger
Sub under Section 9.02(e)); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit any remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub as contemplated by Section
11.09 or for a violation of, or action inconsistent with, Section 9.02(d).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Company seek any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect or punitive damages against Parent or any
other Parent Party, other than payment by Parent of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(v) in the circumstance
where the Reverse Termination Fee is owed pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(v) and
any payment owed by Parent under Section 9.02(e) and expense reimbursement
owed by Parent under Section 5.15, and in no event shall the Company be
entitled to aggregate payments from all sources exceeding the amounts
specifically identified in this sentence as being owed by Parent and then in
only the circumstances in which such amounts are so owed. The Company
acknowledges, covenants and agrees that neither it nor any other Company Party
has and shall have any right of recovery against, and no liability shall
attach to, including in each case with respect to any actual or claimed loss
or damages of any kind of the Company or any other Company Party or any
Company Representative or any other person claiming by, through or for the
benefit of the Company, any of the Parent Parties (other than the Company\'s
right to recover against Parent to the extent specifically provided in the
immediately preceding sentence and subject to the limitations set forth
therein), through Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
applicable Law, through a claim based in tort, contract, statute or otherwise.



(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this Section 9.02 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Reverse Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii)
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.02 and, in order to obtain such
payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the other party for the payment of any
amount set forth in this Section 9.02, such paying party shall pay the other
party its costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate
as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.



Section 9.03. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in this Article IX, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
officers or directors or other representatives of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether as a result of a failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder); provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement and Section 5.01(b), Article IX, Article X and Article XI of this
Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement, and each of the parties
shall remain bound to comply with all such surviving obligations, including
the payment of any applicable Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses or the
Reverse Termination Fee.

Law. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing
the Merger and the execution of this Agreement.



Section 11.03. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each

nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall
be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or

Section 11.06. Governing Law. This Agreement, including the validity hereof
and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, and all amendments
and supplements hereof and all waivers and consents hereunder, shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the domestic substantive laws of
the State of Minnesota without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts
of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the domestic
substantive laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court located within the State of Minnesota over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
dispute or any suit, action or proceeding related thereto may be heard and
determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the

dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.



Section 11.07. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party acknowledges and agrees that

limitation, the provisions on limitation on liability and remedies set forth
in Section 2.06(b), Article VII, Article IX and Section 11.09) is not affected
in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are

forth in Article IX and Section 11.09 of this Agreement.

prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If Parent or Merger Sub commences

subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), then Parent and/or
Merger Sub shall be entitled to be reimbursed by any Company Party responsible
for any conduct necessitating the commencement of such suit for the costs and
expenses of Parent and/or Merger Sub incurred in connection with such suit
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel); provided, however, it is
understood and agreed that, if the Merger is ordered to be or otherwise is
consummated, Parent and/or Merger Sub may choose to seek such reimbursement
from any responsible Company Party other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries so that the economic consequence of such reimbursement is borne
other than by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that
neither the Company nor any other Company Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or to cause the consummation of the Merger or otherwise to obtain
any equitable relief against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Party and
that the Company\'s sole and exclusive remedy shall be set forth in Section

at the principal executive office of the Corporation or at such other place as
may be designated by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer.
But any meeting called by or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders
shall be held in the county where the principal executive office of the
Corporation is located. The Board of Directors may determine that shareholders
not physically present in person or by proxy at a shareholder meeting may, by
means of remote communication, participate in a shareholder meeting held at a
designated place. The Board of Directors also may determine that a meeting of
the shareholders shall not be held at a physical place, but instead solely by
means of remote communication. Participation by remote communication
constitutes presence at the meeting.



Section 1.02 Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the shareholders may be
held on an annual or other less frequent basis as determined by the Board of
Directors; provided, however, that if a regular meeting has not been held
during the immediately preceding 15 months, a shareholder or shareholders
holding three percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to
vote may demand a regular meeting of shareholders by written demand given to
the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation. At
each regular meeting the shareholders shall elect qualified successors for
directors who serve for an indefinite term or whose terms have expired or are
due to expire within six months after the date of the meeting and may transact
any other business, provided, however, that no business with respect to which
special notice is required by law shall be transacted unless such notice shall
have been given.



Section 1.03 Special Meetings. A special meeting of the shareholders may be
called for any purpose or purposes at any time by the Chief Executive Officer;
by the Chief Financial Officer; by the Board of Directors or any two or more
members thereof; or by one or more shareholders holding not less than ten
percent of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote
(except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to
directly or indirectly effect a business combination, including any action to
change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board of Directors for that
purpose, must be called by shareholders holding not less than twenty-five
percent of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote), who shall demand
such special meeting by written notice given to the Chief Executive Officer or
the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation specifying the purposes of such
meeting.



Section 1.04 Meetings Held Upon Shareholder Demand. Within 30 days after
receipt of a demand by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial
Officer from any shareholder or shareholders entitled to call a meeting of the
shareholders, it shall be the duty of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation to cause a special or regular meeting of shareholders, as the case
may be, to be duly called and held on notice no later than 90 days after
receipt of such demand. If the Board fails to cause such a meeting to be
called and held as required by this Section, the shareholder or shareholders
making the demand may call the meeting by giving notice as provided in Section
1.06 hereof at the expense of the Corporation.



Section 1.05 Adjournments. Any meeting of the shareholders may be adjourned
from time to time to another date, time and place. If any meeting of the
shareholders is so adjourned, no notice as to such adjourned meeting need be given if the date, time and place at which the
meeting will be reconvened are announced at the time of adjournment and the
adjourned meeting is held not more than 120 days after the date fixed for the
original meeting.



Section 1.06 Notice of Meetings. Unless otherwise required by law, written
notice of each meeting of the shareholders, stating the date, time, and place
and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes, shall be given
at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting to every holder
of shares entitled to vote at such meeting except as specified in Section 1.05
or as otherwise permitted by law. Notice may be given to a shareholder by
means of electronic communication if the requirements of Minnesota Statutes
Section 302A.436, Subdivision 5, as amended from time to time, are met. The
business transacted at a special meeting of shareholders is limited to the
purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.



Section 1.07 Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive notice of the date,
time, place, or purpose of a meeting of shareholders. A waiver of notice by a
shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after
the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic
communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a meeting,
including attendance by means of remote communication, is a waiver of notice
of that meeting, unless the shareholder objects at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because
the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not
participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting.



Section 1.08 Voting Rights.



Subdivision 1. A shareholder shall have one vote for each share held which is
entitled to vote. Except as otherwise required by law, a holder of shares
entitled to vote may vote any portion of the shares in any way the shareholder
chooses. If a shareholder votes without designating the proportion or number
of shares voted in a particular way, the shareholder is deemed to have voted
all of the shares in that way.



Subdivision 2. The Board of Directors (or an officer of the Corporation, if
authorized by the Board) may fix a date not more than 60 days before the date
of a meeting of shareholders as the date for the determination of the holders
of shares entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the meeting. When a
date is so fixed, only shareholders on that date are entitled to notice of and
permitted to vote at that meeting of shareholders.



Section 1.09 Proxies. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a
vote by (a) filing a written appointment of a proxy, signed by the
shareholder, with an officer of the Corporation at or before the meeting at
which the appointment is to be effective, or (b) by telephonic transmission or
authenticated electronic communication, whether or not accompanied by written
instructions of the shareholder, of an appointment of a proxy with the
Corporation or the Corporation\'s duly authorized agent at or before the
meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. The telephonic
transmission or authenticated electronic communication must set forth or be
submitted with information from which it can be determined that the
appointment was authorized by the shareholder. Any copy, facsimile
telecommunication, or other reproduction of the original of either the writing
or transmission may be used in lieu of the original, provided that it is a
complete and legible reproduction of the entire original.



Section 1.10 Quorum. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the
shares entitled to vote at a shareholders meeting are a quorum for the
transaction of business. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held
meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact
business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of the
shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum.



Section 1.11 Acts of Shareholders.



Subdivision 1. Except for the election of directors or as otherwise required
by law or specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the
shareholders shall take action by the affirmative vote of the holders of the
greater of (a) a majority of the voting power of the shares present and
entitled to vote on that item of business or (b) a majority of the voting
power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at a duly held meeting of shareholders.
Directors are elected by a plurality of the voting power of the shares present
and entitled to vote on the election of directors at a meeting at which a
quorum is present.



Subdivision 2. A shareholder voting by proxy authorized to vote on less than
all items of business considered at the meeting shall be considered to be
present and entitled to vote only with respect to those items of business for
which the proxy has authority to vote. A proxy who is given authority by a
shareholder who abstains with respect to an item of business shall be
considered to have authority to vote on that item of business.



Section 1.12 Action Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at a meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation may be taken without
a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated
electronic communication, by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that
action or, if the Articles of Incorporation so provide, by shareholders having
voting power equal to the voting power that would be required to take the same
action at a meeting of the shareholders at which all shareholders were
present, but in no event may written action be taken by holders of less than a
majority of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote on that action.
The written action is effective when it has been signed, or consented to by
authenticated electronic communication, by the required shareholders, unless a
different effective time is provided in the written action. If written action
is permitted to be taken, and is taken, by less than all shareholders, then
all shareholders must be notified of its text and effective time within five
days after its effective time.

from time to time by resolution of the Board. Directors need not be
shareholders.

expires at the next regular meeting of the shareholders. A director shall hold
office until a successor is elected and has qualified or until the earlier
death, resignation, removal or disqualification of the director.

elected by the shareholders at the next regular meeting or at any special
meeting duly called for that purpose. Section 2.04 Place of Meetings. Each meeting of the Board of Directors shall
be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation or at such other
place as may be designated from time to time by a majority of the members of

may participate with each other during the meeting.

the election of officers and the transaction of any other business shall be
held without notice at the place of and immediately after each regular meeting
of the shareholders.

be called for any purpose or purposes at any time by any member of the Board
by giving not less than two days\' notice to all directors of the date, time

days\' notice shall be given. The notice need not state the purpose of the
meeting.



Section 2.07 Waiver of Notice; Previously Scheduled Meetings. Subdivision 1. A
director of the Corporation may waive notice of the date, time and place of a
meeting of the Board. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is
effective whether given before, at or after the meeting, and whether given in
writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance.
Attendance by a director at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting,
unless the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction
of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and
thereafter does not participate in the meeting.



Subdivision 2. If the day or date, time and place of a Board meeting have been
provided herein or announced at a previous meeting of the Board, no notice is
required. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given other than by
announcement at the meeting at which adjournment is taken of the date, time
and place at which the meeting will be reconvened.



Section 2.08 Quorum. The presence of a majority of the directors currently
holding office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present
may adjourn a meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum
is present. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is
convened, the directors present may continue to transact business until
adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of the directors
originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise
required for a quorum.



Section 2.09 Acts of Board. Except as otherwise required by law or specified
in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board shall take
action by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a
duly held meeting.

in a Board meeting by conference telephone, or, if authorized by the Board, by
any other means of remote communication through which the director, other
directors so participating, and all directors physically present at the
meeting may participate with each other during the meeting. A director so
participating is deemed present at the meeting.



Section 2.11 Absent Directors. A director of the Corporation may give advance
written consent or opposition to a proposal to be acted on at a Board meeting.
If the director is not present at the meeting, consent or opposition to a
proposal does not constitute presence for purposes of determining the
existence of a quorum, but consent or opposition shall be counted as a vote in
favor of or against the proposal and shall be entered in the minutes or other
record of action at the meeting, if the proposal acted on at the meeting is substantially the same or has substantially the same effect as the
proposal to which the director has consented or objected.



Section 2.12 Action Without a Meeting. An action required or permitted to be
taken at a Board meeting may be taken without a meeting by written action
signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of
the directors. Any action, other than an action requiring shareholder
approval, if the Articles of Incorporation so provide, may be taken by written
action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by
the number of directors that would be required to take the same action at a
meeting of the Board at which all directors were present. The written action
is effective when signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic
communication, by the required number of directors, unless a different
effective time is provided in the written action. If written action is
permitted to be taken, and is taken, by less than all directors, then all
directors shall be notified immediately of its text and effective date.

committee, and may delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the authority of
the committee. In these By-Laws, unless the language or context clearly
indicates that a different meaning is intended, any reference to a committee
is deemed to include a subcommittee, and any reference to a committee member
is deemed to include a subcommittee member.

of this Agreement or earlier, upon the written direction of the Parent.



ARTICLE II



The Paying Agent covenants and agrees that:



Section 2.1. Letter of Transmittal Mailing. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Paying Agent shall send a Letter of
Transmittal, in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A, together with a
wire form (the "Wire Form"), to be used as an election by each record holder
(a "Record Holder") of an outstanding certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced Shares which shall have been
converted into the right to be exchanged for a cash payment pursuant to the
provisions of the Merger Agreement, and a return envelope addressed to the
Paying Agent, to each Record Holder. Such Letter of Transmittal will advise
such Record Holder of the terms of such conversion and the procedure for
surrendering to the Paying Agent such certificate or certificates in exchange
for cash.



Section 2.2. Request for Information by Shareholders. The Paying Agent will
promptly respond to any telephone, email or mail requests for information
relating to the surrender of stock certificates and the payment of cash
therefor.



Section 2.3. Proper Form. The Paying Agent will examine the Letters of
Transmittal and certificates delivered or mailed to the Paying Agent by
Stockholders to ascertain that (i) the Letters of Transmittal are properly
completed and duly executed in accordance with the instructions set forth
therein, (ii) no stop transfer instructions are outstanding against such
certificates (which determination shall be based solely on the information
provided to the Paying Agent under Section 1.1 above), (iii) the certificates
have been duly endorsed or assigned for transfer or have been delivered to the
Paying Agent, where required, and are otherwise in proper form for surrender,
(iv) any other documents contemplated by a Letter of Transmittal are properly
completed and duly executed in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal, (v)
such Shares do not constitute Dissenters\' Shares, and (vi) no payment
pursuant to the Merger Agreement was previously made with respect to such
Shares (other than as specifically provided for herein). In cases where the
Letter of Transmittal has been improperly completed or executed or where the
shares presented are not in proper form for transfer, or if some other
irregularity exists in connection with their surrender, including any
irregularity relating to stop transfer instructions, the Paying Agent will
consult with the Parent and the Seller Representatives on taking such actions
as are necessary to cause such irregularity to be corrected. In this regard,
the Paying Agent is authorized to waive an irregularity in connection with the
surrender of Shares after review of the irregularity with the Parent and the
Seller Representatives and after approval in writing by each, provided that
the Paying Agent agrees that waiving such irregularity shall not cause the
Paying Agent to be subjected to any potential liability related thereto.

Section 2.4. Submission of Stock Certificates and Payments to Stockholders. 

(a) Subject to Sections 2.4(c) and 2.8, the Company, the Parent and the Seller
Representatives hereby jointly direct the Paying Agent, consistent with this
Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal and/or Wire Form and Schedule A, to
promptly mail by first class mail to each Stockholder who has surrendered

pick-up upon reasonable advance notice to allow for processing time, a check
drawn, or remit a bank wire transfer (if applicable), in the amount of Closing
Consideration set forth directly across from such Stockholder\'s name on
Schedule A. Wire transfer instructions will be provided for each Stockholder
electing a bank wire transfer by direction of the Stockholder in accordance
with a completed Wire Form. If payment is made by check, it shall be made
payable to the holder of record of the Shares represented by such certificates
or to the person whose name has been specified in the New Registration
Instructions contained in the Letter of Transmittal received by the Paying
Agent with respect to payment of the Closing Consideration for such shares.



(b) Any Additional Merger Consideration payments will be paid in accordance
with the subsequent distribution allocation percentages set forth on Schedule
A to holders who have surrendered exchangeable Shares upon delivery of the
funds from the Escrow Agent or from the Parent in respect of a Purchase Price
Adjustment and in respect of a Company Tax Refund to the Paying Agent for
purpose of payment to Stockholders. The Paying Agent will forward all such
payment by first-class mail, postage prepaid.



(c) Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a list of the Stockholder Note Makers.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) the Merger Consideration due to each
Stockholder Note Maker pursuant to Section 2.4(a) has been reduced by the
Offset Amount as set forth on Schedule A in order to render the applicable
Stockholder Note Receivable paid in full as of the Effective Date and (ii) the
Company shall mark the applicable Stockholder Notes Receivable "Paid-in-Full"
and return it to each applicable Stockholder Note Maker at such Stockholder\'s
address listed on Schedule A.



Section 2.5. Cash Payments to Optionholders.



(a) The Company, the Parent and the Seller Representatives hereby jointly
direct the Paying Agent, consistent with this Agreement, the Merger Agreement
and Schedule A, to promptly mail by first class mail to each Optionholder
listed on Schedule A a check drawn in the amount of payments at Closing
payable to each Optionholder set forth directly across from such
Optionholder\'s name on Schedule A.



(b) Any Additional Merger Consideration payments will be paid to the
Optionholders in accordance with the subsequent distribution allocation
percentages set forth on Schedule A upon delivery of the funds from the Escrow
Agent (or from the Parent in respect of a Purchase Price Adjustment or in
respect of a Company Tax Refund) to the Paying Agent for purpose of payment to
Optionholders.



Section 2.6. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Stockholder
reports that the failure to surrender a certificate representing Shares
registered in his, her or its name is due to the theft, loss or destruction
thereof, the Paying Agent shall require that such Stockholder deliver to the
Paying Agent an affidavit of such theft, loss or destruction in form
reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent and the Parent and that such
Stockholder furnish a bond of indemnity in an amount not more than double the
value of such Shares and in form satisfactory to the Paying Agent and Parent
before delivering to such Stockholder or its transferee the Common Merger
Consideration to which it is entitled. Thereafter, the Paying Agent may effect
payment to such Stockholder as though the certificate had been surrendered.
The Paying Agent shall be held harmless and indemnified by the Company from
any and all liability with respect to any payment made to any Stockholder on
the basis of any such affidavit and bond of indemnity without presentation of
a certificate.



Section 2.7. Tax Reporting.



(a) Payments to Stockholders. The Paying Agent will report organizational
actions based on constructive receipt rules, unless the Company provides an issuer statement pursuant to IRC
§6045B that states a different reporting period should apply as the effective
date of the organizational action. The Paying Agent\'s withholding obligation
will be based on the Effective Date of the organizational action regardless of
when payment is actually made; the Paying Agent will prepare and file on
behalf of the Company, if required in connection with payments made by the
Paying Agent to former Stockholders under this Agreement, the appropriate
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 1099B. All amounts or payments of
Additional Merger Consideration will be reported in the same manner using IRS
Form 1099B.



(b) Payments to Non Employee Holders of Options. The Company will handle or
cause to be handled any tax reporting that must be done regarding payments to
Optionholders and on W-2\'s. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent is responsible for reporting income earned in the Escrow Account; as
between the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will have no
duty to report any such income.



(c) IRS Tax Identification Forms. The Paying Agent shall be considered the
payor with respect to payments made on behalf of the Company pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, except in the case of subsequent distributions
resulting in interest payments to Stockholders, and except in the case of
payments to Optionholders. Accordingly, except as provided in the foregoing
sentence, the Paying Agent is considered the "withholding agent" for purposes
of the payments as that term is defined under the regulations of the IRS. The
Paying Agent will solicit Stockholders with IRS. Form W-8 (foreign) as part of
the Letter of Transmittal mailing. The Paying Agent will also either: (i)
solicit Stockholders with IRS Form W9 (domestic) as part of the Letter of
Transmittal mailing; or (ii) receive from the Company written certification
that the Company has obtained or will obtain a certified Form W-9 (as
evidenced on Schedule A) from all Stockholders prior to delivery of the files
with Stockholder information. The Company hereby agrees that it shall retain
any such W-9 forms and make them available to the Paying Agent upon the Paying
Agent\'s request. If such tax reporting documentation is not provided by the
Stockholder or by the Company and certified to the Paying Agent, the Paying
Agent may be required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold a portion of any payment
made to the Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement.



(d) Indemnification. The Parent and the Seller Representatives (with respect
to the Seller Representatives, out of the Administrative Escrow Fund) shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold the Paying Agent harmless
from and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or
expense that may be assessed against the Paying Agent arising out of or in
connection with the performance of the Paying Agent\'s obligations under the
terms of this Section 2.7 unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or
other expense was directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Paying Agent. The indemnification provided by this Section
2.7(d) is in addition to the indemnification provided in Section 4.5 and shall
survive the resignation or removal of the Paying Agent and the termination of
this Agreement.



Section 2.8. Submission of Stock Certificates Not of Record but Who Have
Acquired Their Shares in Due Course. Certain stock certificates may be
tendered by Stockholders who are holders in due course but are not registered
holders. Upon submission of such a certificate duly endorsed or with
assignments duly executed by the registered holder (or his duly appointed
agent, attorney, executor, administrator, guardian or other fiduciary),
together with the requisite medallion guarantee of signature (and evidence of
authority if appropriate) if such certificate is accompanied by a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent will be
entitled to treat such certificate as if surrendered by the registered holder
thereof; provided, however, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof
that that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in
advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Common Merger Consideration to any Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason
relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.



Section 2.9. Cancellation of Surrendered Stock Certificates, Stockholders
Lists. At the time of the Paying Agent\'s issuance of a check as described in
Section 2.4 above, the Paying Agent will cancel each stock certificate
surrendered in exchange for such check. For the term of this Agreement, the
Paying Agent will maintain on a continuing basis a list of those Stockholders
who have surrendered their stock certificates, and at the request of the
Parent or the Seller Representatives, the Paying Agent will inform each as to whether certain
Stockholders have surrendered their shares. The Paying Agent will also make
available to the Parent and the Seller Representatives such other information
as the Paying Agent may have in its possession and as they may reasonably
request from time to time.



Section 2.10. Canceled Stock. Subject to applicable law and regulation, the
Paying Agent shall maintain (i) in a retrievable database electronic records
or (ii) in hard copy form physical records of all canceled stock certificates
which have been canceled by the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall
maintain such electronic records or physical records for the time period
required by applicable law and regulation. Upon written request of the Parent
or the Seller Representatives (and at the expense of the requesting party),
the Paying Agent shall provide to the requesting party or its designee copies
of such electronic records or physical records relating to stock certificates
canceled by the Paying Agent.



Section 2.11. Mailing of Second Letter of Transmittal and Unexchanged
Shareholder Program. The Paying Agent shall send a second Letter of
Transmittal to all Stockholders that have failed to send in their stock for
exchange at a time deemed appropriate by the Paying Agent, which will
typically be not earlier than four (4) and not later than eight (8) months
after the Effective Time of the Merger.

Section 3.1. Termination of Exchange Fund. If any portion of the Exchange
Fund remains unclaimed by the Stockholders or Optionholders thirty (30) days
after the later of (i) the Tax Survival Period and (ii) the final distribution
of all amounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the Administrative Escrow
Fund, such portion shall be paid to Parent, and the Exchange Fund shall be
closed; and thereafter, this Agreement shall terminate. Any Stockholder or
Optionholder shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Common
Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration payable in respect of each

Section 3.5. Remittance of Unclaimed Property. The Paying Agent or its duly
appointed agent shall timely remit unclaimed funds to the appropriate state or

or regulation. The Paying Agent shall provide such reports regarding unclaimed
property services hereunder as the Company may reasonably request from time to
time together with responsible documentation supporting the Paying Agent\'s
decision to remit any unclaimed funds prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 3.1. Section 3.6. Lost Security Holder Search Services. Pursuant to Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") rules (See SEC Rule 240.17Ad-17, as amended),

not necessarily limited to, data or information which identifies past, current
or potential customers, shareholders, business practices, financial results,
research, development, systems and plans; and/or certain information and
material identified by the Company, the Parent, the Seller Representatives or
the Paying Agent as "Proprietary" or "Confidential"; and/or data the Paying
Agent furnishes to the Parent, the Company or the Seller Representatives from
the Paying Agent\'s database; and/or data received from the Company, the
Parent or the Seller Representatives and enhanced by the Paying Agent.
Confidential Data may be written, oral, recorded, or maintained on other forms
of electronic media. Because of the sensitive nature of the information that
the Parent, the Seller Representatives or the Paying Agent and its employees
or agents may obtain as a result of this Agreement, the intent of the parties
is that these provisions be interpreted as broadly as possible to protect
Confidential Data.



Section 5.2. Relief. The Paying Agent acknowledges that all Confidential
Data furnished by the Company, the Seller Representatives or the Parent is
considered proprietary and strictly confidential. The Paying Agent also
acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Data
may cause irreparable harm to the Company, the Parent or the Seller
Representatives. Accordingly, the Paying Agent agrees that the Company, the
Parent or the Seller Representatives shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief, in addition to all other remedies available at
law for any threatened or actual breach of this agreement or any threatened or
actual unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Data. The Parent, the
Seller Representatives and the Company agree that the provisions and remedies
of this section shall also apply to Confidential Data received by the Parent,
the Seller Representatives or the Company relating to the Paying Agent.



Section 5.3. Security Measures. The Paying Agent will employ the same
security measures to protect Confidential Data received from the Parent, the
Seller Representatives and the Company that it would employ for its own
comparable confidential information (but in no event less than a reasonable
degree of care in handling Confidential Data). Without limiting the foregoing,
the Paying Agent further agrees, subject to applicable law and regulations,
that: (i) Confidential Data shall not be distributed, disclosed, or conveyed
to any third party except by prior written approval of the Parent and the
Seller Representatives; (ii) no copies or reproductions shall be made of any
Confidential Data, except as needed to provide the services described in this
Agreement; and (iii) the Paying Agent shall not use any Confidential Data for
its own benefit or for the benefit of any third party.



Section 5.4. Subpoena, Summons or Legal Process. Except as prohibited by
applicable law or regulation, the Paying Agent shall promptly notify the
Parent, the Seller Representatives and the Company in writing of any subpoena,
summons or other legal process served on the Paying Agent for the purpose of
obtaining Confidential Data (i) consisting of a shareholder list, such as an
identified class of shareholders, or (ii) relating to significant regulatory
action or litigation that would have a material effect on the performance of
the Paying Agent, the Parent, the Seller Representatives or the Company. In
such cases, the Parent, the Seller Representatives or the Company shall have a
reasonable opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures; provided,
however, that this subsection shall not require the Paying Agent to notify the
Parent, the Seller Representatives or the Company of its receipt of any
subpoena, summons or other legal process seeking Confidential Data for a single shareholder or group of related
shareholders in connection with routine tax levies or other routine third
party litigation involving a shareholder or if the Paying Agent is prohibited
by law or regulation from making such disclosure. The Parent and the Seller
Representatives (out of the Administrative Escrow Fund) will indemnify the
Paying Agent for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Paying Agent in
connection with determining the lawful release of the Confidential Data which
each being responsible for 50% of such indemnification.



Section 5.5. Exceptions. The obligations set forth in Sections 5.1 through
5.4 above shall not apply to:



(a) any disclosure specifically authorized in writing by the Parent, the
Seller Representatives or the Paying Agent;



(b) any disclosure required by applicable law or regulation, including
pursuant to a court order; or



(c) Confidential Data which:



(1) has become public without violation of this Agreement; or

(2) was disclosed to the receiving party by a third party not under an
obligation of confidentiality to any party; or

(3) was independently developed by the disclosing party not otherwise in
violation or breach of this Agreement or any other obligation of the parties
to each other; or

(4) was rightfully known to the receiving party prior to entering into this
Agreement.



Section 5.6. Obligations Beyond Termination or Assignment. The obligations
of each party set forth in Sections 5.5(a), (b) and (c) above shall survive
termination or assignment of this Agreement.



Section 5.7. Compliance. The Paying Agent\'s appointment and acceptance of its
duties under this Agreement is contingent upon verification of all regulatory
requirements applicable to the Company, the Parent and the Seller
Representatives, including successful completion of a final background check.
These conditions include, without limitation, requirements under the USA
Patriot Act Customer Identification Program (CIP), the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA),
and the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC), each as may be amended from time to time. If these conditions are not
met, the Paying Agent may at its option promptly terminate this Agreement in
whole or in part, and without the Paying Agent having any liability or
incurring any additional costs.



Section 5.8. Certain Costs. Without limiting in any manner the joint and
several nature of the indemnification of Parent and the Seller Representatives
in favor of the Paying Agent with respect to Section 2.7(d) or Section 4.6,
the Parent and the Seller Representatives (with respect to the Seller
Representatives, out of the Administrative Escrow Fund) agree among themselves
that the Parent, on the one hand, and the Seller Representatives, on the other
hand, will each be responsible for 50% of any costs or expenses with respect
to any indemnification pursuant to Section 2.7(d) or Section 4.6, without
regard to the party that actually incurs or pays such costs to the Paying
Agent; provided, however, that if either of the Parent or the Seller
Representatives is required to pay to the Paying Agent more than such party\'s
50% share of the costs and expenses under Section 2.7(d) or Section 4.6, then
the underpaying party will reimburse the overpaying party for the excess,
which in the case of the Seller Representatives will be paid by the Seller
Representatives out of the Administrative Escrow Fund.

(a) List of Dissenting Stockholders. Attached hereto as Exhibit C is a
list setting forth (i) the name of each Stockholder holding Dissenting Shares
("Dissenting Stockholders"), (ii) the number of Dissenting Shares held by each
Dissenting Stockholder at Closing, and (iii) in respect of each Dissenting
Stockholder, an amount equal to the product of (x) such Dissenting
Stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares and (y) the Per Share Portion of the Closing
Consideration (such product, the "Dissenting Stockholder\'s Fair Value
Portion").



(b) Notice of Dissenting Procedures and Deposit of Shares. Within two (2)
Business Days after the Effective Date, Parent shall cause Surviving
Corporation to send out a notice of procedure and request for deposit of
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Procedural Notice and Share Demand") to
all Dissenting Stockholders, which Procedural Notice and Share Demand shall
comply in all respects with the requirements of Subdivision 4(a) of MBCA §
302A.473.



(c) Surviving Corporation\'s Receipt of Payment Demand and Certificated
Shares. Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to keep a record of the
responses of the Dissenting Stockholders to the Procedural Notice and Share
Demand and shall forward copies of the same to the Seller Representatives.
Parent further shall cause Surviving Corporation to prepare, and provide to
the Seller Representatives, a list of each Dissenting Stockholder who, within
thirty (30) days after the date of the Procedural Notice and Share Demand, (i)
demanded payment and (ii) deposited such Dissenting Stockholder\'s
certificated shares of Company Common Stock with the Surviving Corporation.



(d) Fair Value Remittance List. Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation
to prepare a remittance list of those Dissenting Stockholders who have
complied fully with Subdivisions 3 and 4 of MBCA § 302A.473 (the "Remittance
List"). The Remittance List shall set forth (i) the name of each such
Dissenting Stockholder, (ii) the number of certificated shares of Company
Common Stock deposited with Surviving Corporation by each such Dissenting Stockholder,

Surviving Corporation by Dissenting Stockholders. Immediately thereafter:



(i) Parent and the Seller Representatives shall jointly direct the Escrow
Agent in writing to transfer to Surviving Corporation from the Dissenting
Shares Escrow Account, the aggregate amount of all Dissenting Stockholder\'s
Fair Value Portions on the Remittance List plus any interest required by MBCA
§ 302A.473, as calculated by Surviving Corporation, for disbursement in
accordance with Section 5(e); and



(ii) Parent and the Seller Representatives shall further jointly direct the
Escrow Agent in writing to transfer from the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account
to the Paying Agent for deposit in the Exchange Fund the Dissenting
Stockholder\'s Fair Value Portion with respect to any Dissenting Stockholder
not included on the Remittance List because the Dissenting Stockholder did not
comply fully with Subdivisions 3 and 4 of MBCA § 302A.473 (each, an "Excluded
Dissenting Stockholder"), and Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to remit to each Excluded Dissenting Stockholder such Dissenting
Stockholder\'s Fair Value Portion. Pursuant to Section 2.06 of the Merger
Agreement, each such Excluded Dissenting Stockholder shall no longer
constitute a Dissenting Stockholder and each Dissenting Share held by an
Excluded Dissenting Stockholder will be treated as if it had been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration, without interest.



(e) Remittance and Materials. Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to
remit to each Dissenting Stockholder on the Remittance List, such Dissenting
Stockholder\'s Fair Value Portion plus any interest required by MBCA §
302A.473, accompanied by the materials described in Subdivision 5(a) of MBCA §
302A.473, which materials shall have been approved in writing by the Seller
Representatives. In such materials, the Company\'s estimate of "fair value" of
the Dissenting Shares under Subdivision 5(a)(2) of MBCA § 302A.473 shall
provide that "fair value" includes the Dissenting Stockholder\'s Fair Value
Portion (including required interest) that is being remitted with the
materials plus the right to receive the product of (x) such Dissenting
Stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares and (y) the Per Share Portion of the
Additional Merger Consideration. To the extent necessary, Parent shall cause
Surviving Corporation to provide any notice required and otherwise comply with
Subdivision 5(b) of MBCA § 302A.473.



(f) Supplemental Payment Demands. Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation
to provide to the Seller Representatives (i) a copy of each Dissenting
Stockholder\'s response to the Section 5(e) remittance and materials,
including the Dissenting Stockholder\'s own estimate of the fair value of the
shares, (ii) a list of each Dissenting Stockholder that demanded supplemental
payment ("Supplemental Payment") under Subdivision 6 of MBCA § 302A.473
(including, to the extent applicable, any Dissenting Stockholder that,
pursuant to Subdivision 5(b) of MBCA § 302A.473, has declined an offer and
demanded payment) and (iii) a list of any Dissenting Stockholder that failed
to make a demand within the requirements of Subdivision 6 of MBCA § 302A.473
and, by such failure, has accepted the Dissenting Stockholder\'s Fair Value
Portion plus interest remitted pursuant to Section 5(e) above.



(g) Response to Demand for Supplemental Payment. In the event the Supplemental Payment demands (plus (x) any interest attributable thereto
included in such demand and (y) any amount equal to a reasonable estimate of
expenses potentially payable by the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof)
are equal to or less than the then remaining balance in the Dissenting Shares
Escrow Account, the Seller Representatives shall (i) direct the Escrow Agent
in writing to pay such Dissenting Stockholders the Supplemental Payment demand
in accordance with Subdivision 6 of MBCA § 302A.473, or such lesser amount
agreed to by Dissenting Stockholder (provided, however, that the Seller
Representatives shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, direct
the Escrow Agent to pay any Dissenting Stockholder an amount per Dissenting
Share, which, if multiplied by all other Dissenting Shares held by other
Dissenting Stockholders, would produce an amount that exceeds the then
remaining balance in the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account immediately after
such payment to such Dissenting Stockholder), or (ii) direct the Surviving
Corporation to file a petition to determine the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares as provided in Subdivision 7 of MBCA § 302A.473 (all as contemplated by
Section 5(i) below). In the event the aggregate Supplemental Payment demands
(plus (x) any interest attributable thereto included in such demand and (y)
any amount equal to a reasonable estimate of expenses potentially payable by
the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof) are greater than the then
remaining balance in the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account, Parent, on behalf
of the Surviving Corporation shall (i) pay such Dissenting Stockholder the
Supplemental Payment demand in accordance with Subdivision 6 of MBCA §
302A.473, or such lesser amount agreed to by Dissenting Stockholder, or (ii)
file a petition to determine the fair value of the Dissenting Shares as
provided in Subdivision 7 of MBCA § 302A.473.



(h) Distribution for Payment of Supplemental Payment. In the event of
payment of any demand for Supplemental Payment (plus any interest attributable
thereto included in such demand) as determined pursuant to Section 5(g) above,
Parent and the Seller Representatives shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent in
writing to transfer from the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account to the Surviving
Corporation via wire transfer, the amount thereof (the "Supplemental Demand
Claim"). The Supplemental Demand Claim shall equal the amount by which the
Supplemental Payment exceeds the amount already remitted to such Dissenting
Stockholder for their Dissenting Shares plus the right to receive the amount
of Additional Merger Consideration, if any, to which the Dissenting
Stockholder is entitled.



(i) Escrow Payments of Court Claims. With respect to any Dissenting
Stockholder for which, pursuant Sections 5(g) and 5(h), no Supplement Payment
is made and not otherwise settled, Surviving Corporation, within sixty (60)
days after receiving Dissenting Stockholder\'s demand for Supplemental
Payment, shall file in court a petition requesting that the court determine
the fair market value of the Dissenting Shares, plus interest, in accordance
with Subdivision 7 of MBCA § 302A.473 (the "Court Claim"). Parent shall
control the Court Claim; provided, however, that in the event the aggregate
demands for Supplement Payment are equal to or less than the then remaining
balance in the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account, the Seller Representatives
shall have the right to participate in the Court Claim and employ its own
counsel at its own expense and Surviving Corporation shall promptly provide to
the Seller Representatives copies of all items related to its compliance with
Subdivision 7 of MBCA § 302A.473 and all other materials related to the
proceeding, including all items or materials submitted to Surviving
Corporation or to the court by the Dissenting Stockholder, including the
Dissenting Stockholder\'s own estimate of fair market value. Upon a settlement
or a final and non-appealable determination of the fair market value of the
Dissenting Shares in the Court Claim (such amount, whether through settlement
or court determination, the "Court FMV Amount"), Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the Seller Representatives shall:



(i) if the Court FMV Amount plus any interest thereon is greater than the Dissenting Stockholder\'s Fair Value Portion plus the amount of Additional
Merger Consideration, if any, to which the Dissenting Stockholder is entitled,
within ten (10) days of such determination, jointly direct the Escrow Agent in
writing to transfer such excess amount (to the extent of the then remaining
balance of the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account), via wire transfer, to
Surviving Corporation for payment (together with such additional amounts
required, if any, from Parent or Surviving Corporation) to the Dissenting
Stockholder; or



(ii) if the Court FMV Amount plus any interest thereon is equal to or less
than the Dissenting Stockholder\'s Fair Value Portion previously remitted plus
the amount of Additional Merger Consideration, if any, to which the Dissenting
Stockholder is entitled, notify Dissenting Stockholder that all payments under
MBCA § 302A.473 have been made in full and the remittance shall be deemed in
full satisfaction of all Dissenting Shares rights under MBCA § 302A.473, and
Parent and the Seller Representatives shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent in
writing to transfer the then remaining balance of the Dissenting Shares Escrow
Account in respect of the Dissenting Shares in the Court Claim to the Exchange
Fund.



(j) Release of Escrowed Funds. At such time as the rights with respect to
all of the Dissenting Shares are satisfied under MBCA § 302A.473, whether by
failure of perfection, acceptance of remittance, payment of a Supplemental
Payment Claim, payment of Court FMV Amount or otherwise, Parent and the Seller
Representatives will jointly direct the Escrow Agent in writing to pay all
remaining amounts from the Dissenting Shares Escrow Account to the Paying
Agent for deposit in the Exchange Fund after deducting any reasonably
documented expenses, costs or fees incurred by Parent or Surviving Corporation
and any expenses, costs, or fees (including expenses of the court, whether or
not incurred by Parent or Surviving Corporation) required to be paid by Parent
or Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 5 which amounts the Escrow
Agent shall pay to Parent, and at that point, the Dissenting Shares Escrow
Account shall be closed.



6.Additional Deposits, Claims and Payments to Indemnity Escrow Account;
Release from Indemnity Escrow Account.



(a) Additional Deposit to Indemnity Escrow Account. Following Surviving
Corporation\'s receipt of the Company Tax Refund, Parent shall pay the lesser
of (i) the actual amount of such Company Tax Refund received by the Surviving
Corporation and (ii) Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) to the Escrow Agent for
deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Account.



(b) Indemnification Claims to Indemnity Escrow Account. Parent may, from
time to time, give notice to the Escrow Agent and the Seller Representatives

Seller Representatives in accordance with Section 7.03(d) of the Merger
Agreement, and shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Seller
Representatives no later than 5:00 p.m. CST on or before:



(i) the eighteen (18) month anniversary of this Agreement (the "Standard
Indemnity Claims Termination Date") in respect of an Indemnity Claim other

deliver written notice of any objection to the Indemnity Claim (a "Dispute
Notice") to the Escrow Agent and Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. CST on the
twentieth (20th) business day after the day the Escrow Agent received the
Indemnity Claim Notice.



(d) Final Indemnity Claim. An Indemnity Claim shall become a "Final
Indemnity Claim" upon any one of the following events:

pursuant to Section 6(c), and, in such event, the amount of the Final
Indemnity Claim shall equal the amount of the Indemnity Claim set forth in the
Indemnity Claim Notice;



(ii) the Indemnity Claim is settled by joint written agreement signed by
the Seller Representatives and Parent and delivered to the Escrow Agent, and,
in such event, the amount of the Final Indemnity Claim shall equal the amount
set forth in such agreement delivered to the Escrow Agent; or



(iii) either Parent or the Seller Representatives have filed with the
Escrow Agent copies of a final order, decree or judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction, together with an opinion of counsel that the time for
appeal has expired and no appeal has been perfected, and, in such event, the
amount of the Final Indemnity Claim shall be equal to the amount, if any,
awarded by such award or court with respect to such Indemnity Claim.



(e) Partial Release. If any Dispute Notice includes an objection to only a
portion of an Indemnity Claim, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release to
Parent an amount from the Indemnity Escrow Account equal to the portion of the
claim for which there is no objection.



(f) Unresolved Indemnity Claim. Until an Indemnity Claim for which a
Indemnity Claim Notice has been delivered in accordance with Section 6(b)
shall either (i) become a Final Indemnity Claim or (ii) be withdrawn by Parent
by written notice delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Seller
Representatives, it shall be an "Unresolved Indemnity Claim." The amount of
any Unresolved Indemnity Claim shall be the amount set forth in the related
Indemnity Claim Notice less any amounts released to Parent under Section 6(e)
above. Such amount may be adjusted by written notice from Parent to the Escrow
Agent and the Seller Representatives.



(g) Distribution of Final Indemnity Claim. The Escrow Agent shall, within
five (5) business days of the receipt of a Final Indemnity Claim, pay to
Parent (or, if directed by Parent, to a specified Purchaser Indemnified Party)

Dollars ($10,000,000).



(i) Distributions of Extended Period Indemnity Escrow Amounts. On the

(j) Distributions of Tax Period Indemnity Escrow Amounts. On the Tax
Indemnity Claims Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall transfer to the

than the amount reserved in the Indemnity Escrow Account for an Unresolved
Indemnity Claim under Section 6(h)(i), 6(i)(i) or 6(j), the excess of the
amount reserved for such Unresolved Indemnity Claim over the Final Indemnity
Claim shall be paid by Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent for deposit in
Exchange Fund within five (5) business days of the receipt of the Final
Indemnity Claim in respect of such Unresolved Indemnity Claim.



(l) Final Distributions of Indemnity Escrow Amounts. At such time that
Parent and the Seller Representatives provide joint written notice to the
Escrow Agent that any remaining Unresolved Indemnity Claims have been resolved
or have become Final Indemnity Claims and paid in accordance with Section
6(g), all remaining amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be
transferred by the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Fund and the Indemnity Escrow
Account shall be closed by the Escrow Agent.



7.Tax Provisions.



(a) Subject to Section 7(e), the Parties agree that, for tax reporting
purposes, all interest and other income from investment of the Escrow Fund
shall, as of the end of each calendar year and to the extent required by the
Internal Revenue Service, be reported as having been earned by Parent, whether
or not such income was disbursed during such calendar year. The Escrow Agent
shall issue any Internal Revenue Service Forms 1099 (or any other appropriate
or successor forms) relating to the Escrow Account consistently with the
foregoing.



(b) The Escrow Agent shall file all information or other similar returns
reflecting income on the Escrow Fund earned by the Stockholders, Optionholders
and Parent, as applicable, and the distribution of each sub-account of the
Escrow Fund as are required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and applicable Treasury regulations. The Paying Agent and Parent
will each provide the Escrow Agent the identification numbers by furnishing
Escrow Agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as
applicable.



(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of
any taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow
Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the Escrow
Fund. The Parties, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest,
penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed against the Escrow Agent
on or with respect to the Escrow Fund and the investment thereof unless such
tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other expense was directly caused by
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The
indemnification provided by this Section 7(c) is in addition to the
indemnification provided in Section 10(a) and shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.



(d) The responsibility to prepare and file any and all required income or
other tax returns (other than information or other similar returns required to
be filed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 7) applicable to the
Escrow Fund or the income earned thereon with the Internal Revenue Service, as
and to the extent required under the Code and applicable Treasury regulations,
and under applicable state and local laws, is that of the Paying Agent, each
Stockholder, each Optionholder and Parent, as the case may be, and not the
Escrow Agent. The Parties understand that if such tax reporting documentation
is not provided and certified to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be
required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, to withhold a portion of any interest or other income
earned on the investment of the Escrow Fund.



(e) Within 15 days after the last day of each calendar quarter during which
this Agreement remains in effect and immediately prior to any release pursuant
to Sections 4, 5 or 6 (in which case only the net income or net gain since the
close of the prior calendar quarter shall be taken into account), Parent and
the Seller Representatives hereby direct the Escrow Agent to distribute to
Parent an amount equal to the product of (i) any net income or net gain from
investments of the Escrow Amount during such calendar quarter multiplied by
(ii) 40%, provided, however, that such percentage shall rise or fall to match
any increase or decrease to the maximum federal corporate income tax rate
during the term of the Escrow Agreement.



(f) In any case hereunder in which Escrow Agent is to receive instructions
to release, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to entirely rely on such
instructions.

that he, she or it deems appropriate under this Agreement.



(b) Until notified in a writing signed by any of the Seller Representatives
that one of the Seller Representatives has resigned or has been removed and

rely upon any instruction, notice, decision, action or inaction signed by

directive or agreement on behalf of Parent. 9.Duties of the Escrow Agent.

agreement has been provided to the Escrow Agent; and the Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to know or inquire as to the performance or nonperformance of any
provision of any such agreement, instrument, or document. References in this

and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the advice of counsel or other professionals
retained or consulted by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
reimbursed as set forth in Section 10(d) for any and all reasonable and
documented compensation (fees, expenses and other costs) paid and/or
reimbursed to such counsel and/or professionals. The Escrow Agent may perform
any and all of its duties through its agents, representatives, attorneys,
custodians, and/or nominees.



(c) Reliance. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or
not taken by it in accordance with the direction or consent of the Parties or
their respective agents, representatives, successors, or assigns. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any
notice, request, consent, direction, requisition, certificate, order,
affidavit, letter, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons,
without further inquiry into the person\'s or persons\' authority. Concurrent
with the execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent authorized signers\' forms in the form of D-1 and Exhibit D-2 to
this Escrow Agreement.



(d) Right Not Duty Undertaken. The permissive rights of the Escrow Agent
to do things enumerated in this Escrow Agreement shall not be construed as
duties.

require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise incur
any financial liability or potential financial liability in the performance of
its duties or the exercise of its rights under this Escrow Agreement.

(a) Indemnification. Parent and the Seller Representatives, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and
against any and all loss, liability, cost, damage and expense, including,
without limitation, attorneys\' fees and expenses or other professional fees and expenses which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by
reason of any action, claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent,
arising out of or relating in any way to this Escrow Agreement or any
transaction to which this Escrow Agreement relates, unless such loss,
liability, cost, damage or expense shall have been finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
Escrow Agent, with the Parent and the Seller Representatives each bearing one-
half of any costs with respect to such indemnification. The provisions of this
Section 10(a) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and
the termination of this Escrow Agreement.



(b) Limitation of Liability. the escrow agent SHALL NOT be liable,
directly or indirectly, for any (i) damages, Losses or expenses arising out of
the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or expenses which
have been finally adjudicated to have DIRECTLY resulted from the escrow
agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) special, Indirect or
consequential damages or LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), even if the escrow agent has been advised of the
possibility of such LOSSES OR damages AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.



(c) Resignation or Removal. The Escrow Agent may resign by furnishing
written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties may remove
the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a joint written notice of
its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses to which it is
entitled through the date of termination. Such resignation or removal, as the
case may be, shall be effective thirty (30) days after the delivery of such
notice or upon the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow Agent\'s
sole responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Fund and to
deliver the same to a successor escrow agent as shall be appointed by the
Parties, as evidenced by a joint written notice filed with the Escrow Agent or
in accordance with a court order. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
the delivery of such notice of resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting
appointment shall be binding upon the Parties.



(d) Compensation. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation for
its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit E, which
compensation shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Seller Representatives
out of the Administrative Escrow Account. The fee agreed upon for the services
rendered hereunder is intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agent\'s
services as contemplated by this Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that in
the event that the conditions for the disbursement of funds under this Escrow
Agreement are not fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any service not
contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or there is any assignment of interest
in the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, or any material modification
hereof, or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent
is made a party to any litigation pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the
subject matter hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay,
controversy, litigation or event. If any amount due to the Escrow Agent
hereunder is not paid within thirty (30) days of the date due, the Escrow
Agent in its sole discretion may charge interest on such amount up to the
highest rate permitted by applicable law. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is
hereby granted, a prior lien upon the Escrow Fund with respect to its unpaid
fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights, superior
to the interests of any other persons or entities and is hereby granted the
right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and
unsatisfied indemnification rights from the Escrow Fund. (e) Disagreements. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises
between, among, or involving Parent, Seller Representatives or Escrow Agent
concerning the meaning or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning
any other matter relating to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in
doubt as to the action to be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its
option, retain the Escrow Fund until the Escrow Agent (i) receives a final
non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a final non-
appealable arbitration decision directing delivery of the Escrow Fund, (ii)
receives a written agreement executed by each of the parties involved in such
disagreement or dispute directing delivery of the Escrow Fund, in which event
the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance
with such final court order, arbitration decision, or agreement, or (iii)
files an interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon
the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as to
the disputed action and shall be entitled to recover attorneys\' fees,
expenses and other costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such
interpleader action. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any such
agreement, court order, or arbitration decision without further question,
inquiry, or consent.

Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated,
or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate
trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any
corporation or association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger,
consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party, shall be and
