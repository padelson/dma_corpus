ARTICLE I

_The Offer and the Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Article VIII, Merger Sub shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, by 5:00 p.m. (New York City Time) on Friday,
June 13, 2014) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer to purchase for cash any (subject to the Minimum Condition)
and all Shares at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to accept
for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to only those conditions set
forth in _Exhibit A_  (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees
that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any
such Shares held on behalf of third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the
Offer.

 

(b) _Waiver of Tender Offer Conditions_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right from time to time, in its sole discretion, to waive any Tender Offer
Condition or to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i) decrease the
Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii)
decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii)
amend, modify or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in
_Exhibit A_ ) or the Regulatory Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ ), (iv)
amend, modify or supplement any of the other Tender Offer Conditions in a
manner that is adverse to the Companys stockholders, (v) impose additional
conditions to the Offer, (vi) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date
(as defined in Section 1.1(d)) in a manner other than any extension pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement or (vii) amend, modify or supplement
any other term of the Offer in a manner that is adverse to the Companys
stockholders; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
consent to any amendment or modification or other change to this Agreement
that would provide for an Expiration Date prior to August 4, 2014.

(c) _Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Merger Sub shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") 

 



-2-  a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together
with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
and the related offer to purchase, letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to
which the Offer will be made (collectively, and including any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders as and to the
extent required by the applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Laws_
"). The Company agrees to furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning the Company required by the Securities Laws to be set
forth in the Offer Documents. Subject to Section 6.2, the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation
(as defined in Section 5.1(c)(ii)). Each party agrees to correct or supplement
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or such amendment or supplement shall become necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree
to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so amended
or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each
case, as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws. Parent will
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents, and any amendments or supplements thereto, before they are
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, and Parent
shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company. Parent shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to
the Offer Documents and provide copies of such comments to the Company
promptly upon receipt and provide copies of proposed responses to the Company
a reasonable time prior to filing with the SEC and dissemination to the
Companys stockholders to allow for review and prompt comment by the Company,
and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company.

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially
be scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 4, 2014 (the
initial expiration date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of
the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII (and
subject to the Companys and Parents respective rights to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII), (i) Merger Sub shall extend the
Expiration Date for any period required by the Securities Laws, the
interpretations and positions of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto or
the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ")
applicable to the Offer or as may be required by any other Governmental
Entity, and (ii) if at any scheduled Expiration Date the Tender Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date that is not more than ten
(10) business days after such previously scheduled Expiration Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer and
the Expiration Date to a date later than the Termination Date). Merger Sub
shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer without the prior written consent of
the Company other than in connection with the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article VIII. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article

 



-3-  VIII prior to any scheduled Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours of such termination) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _business day_ " means any day other than Saturday or Sunday or day on which
commercial banks are authorized or required by Law or executive order to be
closed in New York City.

 

(e) _Acceptance of and Payment for Shares_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub
of the Tender Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Date in accordance with
Section 1.1(b), Merger Sub shall promptly on or after the Expiration Date
accept for payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and promptly (and in any event within three (3) business
days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay
for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a
timely basis, the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Company shall
register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the transfer of
the Shares accepted for payment by Merger Sub effective promptly after payment
has been made for such Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer.

 

(f) _Withholding_. Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any of the
Companys stockholders such amounts as Merger Sub is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Merger Sub.

(g) _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement, and the
Offer, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and Merger Sub, any
Shares subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be
validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such
notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to Merger Sub or to an agent of
Merger Sub.

1.2 _Company Action_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall file with the SEC on or prior to the
fifth (5th) business day after the date on which Parent and Merger Sub file
the Offer Documents with the SEC (but in no event earlier than the
tenth (10th) business day after the date of this Agreement), a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, and including the
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which shall include the notice
and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL such that the
Schedule 14D-9 will constitute a valid notice of appraisal rights under
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and shall, subject to Section 6.2, include the
Company Recommendation, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to its
stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable Law
(including by setting the Stockholder List Date (as defined below) as the
record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required

 



-4-  by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL). The Company agrees promptly to correct
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall become false or
misleading in any material respect (and each of Parent and Merger Sub, with
respect to information supplied by it specifically for use in the Schedule
14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required corrections of such
information and cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting such
information) and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9
to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and the Company further agrees to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to its stockholders as and to the extent required by the Securities Laws.
Unless the board of directors of the Company has effected a Change of
Recommendation, Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements thereto before
they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Companys stockholders,
and the Company shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. The Company shall respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and, unless the board of directors of the
Company has effected a Change of Recommendation, shall provide copies of such
comments to Parent promptly upon receipt, shall provide copies of proposed
responses to Parent a reasonable time prior to filing with the SEC and
dissemination to the Companys stockholders to allow for review and prompt
comment by Parent and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent.

(b) _Stockholder Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
promptly (and no later than three (3) business days following the date
hereof) furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent mailing labels containing
the names and addresses of all of its stockholders of record as of a date no
more than ten (10) days prior to the date on which Parent and Merger Sub file
the Offer Documents with the SEC (such date, the " _Stockholder List Date_ "),
a non-objecting beneficial owners list and security position listings of
Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, and shall
promptly furnish Parent with such additional information, including updated
lists of stockholders and beneficial owners, mailing labels, security position
listings and computer files, and such other information and assistance as
Parent or its agents may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating
the Offer to the record holders and beneficial owners of Shares. In addition,
in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause third parties to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub
to disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders of Shares held in or subject
to the Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) and to permit such holders
of Shares to tender their Shares into the Offer. Subject to the requirements
of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer
and the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents (i) shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files
and will use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and (ii) following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII, shall promptly, at the election of Parent, deliver to the
Company or destroy, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
agents to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any extract or
summaries of such information then in their possession or control and promptly
certify to the Company in writing that all such material has been returned or
destroyed.

 



-5- (c) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver a certificate
signed by an authorized officer of the Company to the effect that that the
Company is not, and has not been at any time during the five years preceding
the Closing Date, a United States real property holding corporation, as
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, conforming to the requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h).

1.3 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and
the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the DGCL. The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h)
of the DGCL and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Time.

1.4 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company
and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New
York as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, which shall not be
later than the business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on
which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.

1.5  _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, the Company and Parent will cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form
required by, and executed and acknowledged by, the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

2.1 _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate

amended in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto, until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

2.2 _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time

Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the Bylaws.

3.2 _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter
and Bylaws.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

 

 _Exchange of Certificates_

 

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares
owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares
that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have
perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares (each Share
referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 4.1(a) being an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price
(the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ") without interest. At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and each non-
certificated Share represented by book-entry (a " _Book Entry Share_ ")
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each
Certificate formerly representing Shares or Book Entry Shares owned by
Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter only represent the right to receive
the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f).

 



-7- (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof
may have under Section 4.2(f).

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial Services
LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To
the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such
payments under Section 4.1(a).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2)
business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving 

 



-8-  effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal
to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Book Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article IV. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book Entry
Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of
each such Share and the Book Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Share is presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)) or Book Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate or Book Entry
Share has not been surrendered prior to the date on which Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to
such time become the property of the Surviving

 



-9-  Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (i) the number of Shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall
give Parent prompt written notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the opportunity and
right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

(g) _Withholding_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares or Company Options (as defined in Section 4.3(a)) such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares or Company Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 

4.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof (and,
in any event, prior to the Acceptance Time), the board of directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock
Plans) shall take all actions as may

 



-10-  be required to provide that (i) each holder of an option that represents the
right to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans
(other than options under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) and is
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) shall be provided with notice pursuant to which all
outstanding Company Options held by such holder shall become fully vested and
may be exercised (contingent on, and effective immediately after, the
consummation of the Offer) by such holder beginning on the date of such notice
through the date that is five (5) business days prior to the Acceptance Time
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Stock Plan under
which such Company Option was granted and (ii) to the extent that any
outstanding Company Option is not so exercised prior to the Acceptance
Time, such Company Option shall, at the Acceptance Time, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into only the right to receive (without interest) an amount in
cash (less applicable withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the excess,
if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price
per share of such Company Option, and (y) the number of Shares underlying such
Company Option, which amount shall be paid by Parent or the Company as soon
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within three (3) business days)
following the Acceptance Time. In the case of a Company Option with an
exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall, at the Acceptance Time,
automatically be forfeited for no consideration in exchange therefor.

 

(b) _Treatment of ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to (i)
cause the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan not to commence an offering
period to purchase Shares that would otherwise begin after the date of this
Agreement or to accept payroll deductions to be used to purchase Shares under
the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and (ii) to cause the 2014 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan to terminate prior to the time that an offering period to
purchase Shares would otherwise begin.

(c)  _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company,
the board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the
board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of
Section 4.3(a) and Section 4.3(b).

4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Offer Price and the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

 

ARTICLE V

_Representations and Warranties_

5.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC prior to the date
hereof (without giving effect to any amendment to any such Company Reports
filed on or after the date hereof and

 



-11-  excluding any disclosures to the extent such disclosures are general
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements set forth in any section
of a Company Report entitled "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements"
or any other sections of such filings that do not contain a reasonable level
of detail about the risks of which the statements warn) or in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") ( _it_ _being_ _agreed_ that disclosure of any item in
any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to, and only with respect to, any other section or
subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation or similar entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent (i)
complete and correct copies of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents,
each as amended to the date hereof, and each as so made available is in
effect on the date hereof, and (ii) the minutes of all meetings of
stockholders, the Companys board of directors and each committee thereof

Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries; (ii) " _Affiliate_ " means,
with respect to any Person, any other Person, directly or indirectly,

the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and (iii) "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, event, occurrence or
effect that, individually or in the aggregate, is or would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the (x) properties, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, business or results of operations or Covered Assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for the purposes of clause (x), none of the
following, and no change, event, occurrence or effect, individually or in the
aggregate, arising out of, resulting from or attributable to any of the
following, shall constitute or be taken into account in determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would occur:

(A) any changes in general United States or global economic conditions,
except in the event that such changes in conditions have a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, relative to the adverse effect that such changes have on other
pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies (in which case only the incremental
disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining
whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect);

 



-12- (B) any changes in conditions generally affecting the pharmaceutical
or biotechnology industries, except in the event that such changes in
conditions have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse effect that

which case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken
into account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse
Effect);

 

(C) any decline in the market price or trading volume of the Shares on the
NASDAQ ( _provided_ that the exception in this clause (C) shall not prevent
or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, or development
_underlying_ such decline has resulted in or contributed to a Company Material
Adverse Effect);

 

(D) any regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities, credit,
financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the United
States or any foreign jurisdiction, except in the event that such changes in
conditions have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse effect that
such changes have on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies (in which
case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse
Effect); 

(E) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company or its Subsidiaries to meet
any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in
respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any
period ( _provided_ that the exception in this clause (E) shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, or development
underlying such failure has resulted in or contributed to a Company Material
Adverse Effect);

 

(F) the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance by any party
hereto of its obligations hereunder, or the public announcement or pendency
of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or
otherwise, of the Company with its employees or with any other third party;

(G) any litigation arising from allegations of any breach of fiduciary duty or
violation of Law relating to this Agreement or the Offer, the Merger or any

or the enforcement or interpretation thereof;

(I) any geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities,
any acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or military actions, or any escalation
or worsening of any such hostilities, acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or
military actions threatened or underway as of the date of this Agreement,
except in the event that such changes in conditions have a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, relative to the adverse effect that such changes have on other
pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies (in which case only the incremental
disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining
whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect);

 

(J) any action required to be taken pursuant to or in accordance with this
Agreement or taken at the request of Parent or Merger Sub; or

(K) any matter set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
any other part of the Company Disclosure Letter.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Covered Assets_ " means the Companys
assets associated with the Key Product.

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 200,000,000 Shares, of which 150,856,104 Shares were outstanding as of the
close of business on June 8, 2014. All of the outstanding Shares have been
duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of
June 8, 2014, other than 8,795,634 Shares reserved for issuance in respect of
Company Options under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2005 Stock Incentive
Plan, the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, and the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, and
options under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (together with
the foregoing plans, the " _Stock Plans_ "), the Company has no Shares
reserved for issuance. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other
encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ ") other than those arising under federal or
state Securities Laws. Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens other than those
arising under federal or state Securities Laws. The Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the

 



-14-  stockholders of the Company on any matter. For purposes of this Agreement, a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall include any Subsidiary of the
Company of which all of the shares of capital stock of such Subsidiary are
owned by the Company (or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company).

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 

(ii) The board of directors of the Company, by resolutions duly adopted by
unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held at which all directors were
present and voted (which resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way), has (A) approved, and declared advisable, this Agreement
and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and
in accordance with the DGCL, (B) determined that this Agreement and such
transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) and (C) resolved to
recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their
Shares into the Offer (clauses (A) through (C) of this Section 5.1(c)(ii),
the " _Company Recommendation_ ").

(d) _Governmental Filings and Approvals; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

(i) Other than the filings, approvals and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section
1.5, (B) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (C) under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and state securities, takeover and "blue sky" Laws, including the filing and
dissemination of Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 or as may be required
for the Merger, (D) under stock exchange rules and (E) the filings, approvals
and/or notices listed in Section 5.1(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the Company
with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any domestic or
foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court
or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the

 



-15-  Company and the consummation by the Company of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except those, the failure
to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company will not,
constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the comparable
governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right
of termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any material agreement, lease,
license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation
(each, a " _Contract_ ") binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (C) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i),
a violation of any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) of this Section 5.1(d)(ii),
for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration
or change that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), since December 31, 2010
(the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, certifications, reports
and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or
furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto,
the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates
(or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment),
the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished
to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NASDAQ.

(iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Company Reports
filed after the date 

 



-16-  hereof, will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its
date and each of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss, of stockholders equity (deficit) and of cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the
case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in
all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash
flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to notes and year-end adjustments), in each case in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), except as may
be noted therein. 

(A) The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) is effective in
providing reasonable assurance (I) that the Company maintains records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and
dispositions of assets, (II) that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (III) that
transactions are executed only in accordance with authorizations of management
and the board of directors of the Company and (IV) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
the Companys assets.

(B) Except as would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act that are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the
Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors
of the Company (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (2) any fraud, known to the Company, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

 

(iv) _Off-balance Sheet Arrangements_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
(including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under
the Exchange Act), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company in its published financial statements or
other Company Reports.

 



-17- (f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Other than in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2013, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only
in the ordinary course of such businesses and there has not been or occurred:

 

(i) any change, event, or occurrence in the properties, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, business or results of operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect; or

 

(ii) the taking of any action that, if taken during the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of
clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (x) or (xiii) of Section 6.1(a).

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_.

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any executive officer or
director that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental
Entity specifically imposed upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(ii) The Company does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be
set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, other than
liabilities and obligations (A) set forth in the Companys consolidated
balance sheet (and the notes thereto) included in the Company Reports filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) incurred in the ordinary course of
business since December 31, 2013, (C) incurred in connection with the Offer,

other termination of employment, in each case except for continuation
coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code or Sections 601-608 of ERISA ("
_COBRA_ ") or any other applicable Law. The Company, its Subsidiaries and

or its Subsidiaries to any payment (whether severance payment or otherwise)
or any material increase in payment (other than severance pay required by any
applicable Law), or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in
any increase in, or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of,
compensation or benefits under, or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its

-37- (c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of
directors shall not:

thereof may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation
(a " _Change of Recommendation_ " ) if (i) (x) the board of directors of the
Company or any committee thereof receives an Acquisition Proposal that it
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal and the board of
directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or (y) an Intervening Event occurs and as a result
thereof the board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the Company has notified
Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation
describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change of Recommendation
(a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "); (iii) if applicable, the Company has

constitute a Superior Proposal) during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Recommendation Change Notice and ending at the passage of seventy-two (72)

the passage of such seventy-two (72) hour period (the " _Match Period_ ") (
_it_ _being_ _understood_ and agreed that any amendment to any material term
or condition of any Superior Proposal shall require a new Recommendation
Change Notice and a new Match Period); and (v) no earlier than the end of the
Match Period following receipt of the

 



-38-  Recommendation Change Notice by Parent, the board of directors of the
Company or any committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of any
binding proposal to amend or this Agreement by Parent, that the failure to
effect a Change of Recommendation would still be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, if applicable, the board
of directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification
to this Agreement, the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the
Recommendation Change Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and

-39- 6.3 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable (and in any event shall make all filings pursuant to
the HSR Act within ten (10) calendar days of the date hereof) all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent will not withdraw and refile its initial filing or take similar
voluntary action to extend the review period under the HSR Act or any other
Law unless the Company has consented in writing in advance thereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period
with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have
the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company
or its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its
business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon Closing.

 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger
and any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its
officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other

 



-40-  inquiry with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless to the extent practicable (i) it
consults with the other party in advance and (ii) and to the extent permitted
by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or teleconference; _provided_ that such rights
to participate shall not apply when information that the other party deems
competitively sensitive is being discussed.

(d) _Regulatory Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings
pursuant to this Section 6.3, each of the Company (in the case of Sections
6.3(d)(i) and 6.3(d)(iii) set forth below) and Parent (in all cases set
forth below) agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

(i) the prompt provision to each and every domestic or foreign governmental
or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court or executive
governmental entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
antitrust or competition Laws (" _Government Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-
privileged information and documents requested by any Government Antitrust
Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or
enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination, judgment, or Law that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the defense through litigation on
the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by
any Person, including, without limitation, any Governmental Entity, seeking to
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such
transactions and, in the case of any such claim asserted by a Government
Antitrust Entity, the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to
sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such
disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and
holding separate of, such assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories
of assets or businesses or other operations, or interests therein, of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries (and the entry into
agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Government
Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action (a " _Remedy_ ") should
be reasonably necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual,
anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any proceeding in any forum or
(y) issuance or enactment of any order, decree, decision, determination,
judgment or Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation in any material respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by any Government Antitrust Entity ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ that, (I) as it relates to the Company and its Subsidiaries, no
such action will be binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries unless it is
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing and (II) without limitation of
Parents obligations to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove any such
proceeding, order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law on or
prior to the Termination Date, Parent shall have complete discretion in the
negotiation of any such Remedy); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
not be required to sell, divest, hold separate, or license the Key Product
(any such action, a " _Non-Required Remedy_ " ); and

 



-41- (iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event
that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any
proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any and all steps (including, without limitation, the appeal
thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by
clause (ii) of this paragraph (d)) necessary to resist, vacate,
modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, decree or enactment so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.

6.4 _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested (including for purposes of determining whether
the Company or any Subsidiary has undergone any ownership change under the
Section 382 of the Code prior to the Effective Time or determining the
applicability of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code), _provided_ that
no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i)
to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality or (ii) to disclose any privileged
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to
Parent copies of calculations with respect to Section 280G of the Code with
respect to any disqualified individuals in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. At the request of Parent and subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
prompt access for Parents officers and authorized Representatives to the
counterparties to the Material Contracts listed in Section 6.4 of the Company
Disclosure Letter. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section
6.4 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by
the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.5  _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules
and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the de-listing by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from the NASDAQ and the de-registration of the
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time.

 



-42- 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press
release mutually agreed to and thereafter (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred pursuant to Section 6.2(c)) the Company and Parent
shall not issue any press releases or otherwise make public announcements
with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such
release or announcement is required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity. 

6.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Acceptance Time
and ending on the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year
in which the Acceptance Time occurs, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided (1) to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is
employed as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") base salary and annual target cash incentive
opportunity (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity-based
compensation or benefits) which are, in each case, no less than those provided
by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
to each such Continuing Employee, (2) to the Continuing Employees, welfare
benefits and perquisites (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity-
based compensation or benefits) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time under either the Benefit Plans or employee
benefit plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, at Parents sole
discretion, and (3) to each Continuing Employee, severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by Parent under the
Merck and Co., Inc. U.S. Separation Benefits Plan.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, benefit accrual (solely for purposes of
determining severance, vacation and sick time credit) and eligibility
to participate under the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee
after the Acceptance Time (including the Benefit Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "
), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Acceptance Time, to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled, before the Acceptance Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Acceptance Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause (i)
each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Acceptance Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ " )), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, any evidence of insurability requirements, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and

 



-43-  actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plan. Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year.

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or other event with
similar import, within the meaning of the Benefit Plans that contain such
terms will occur upon the Acceptance Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to, honor, assume, fulfill and
discharge the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the Companys
Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. No
later than the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to cause the Change in Control Severance Guidelines for Employees (applicable
to VP Grade and 1-18 Grades) to terminate without any liability to the Company
or its Subsidiaries, effective as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

 

(d) If the Acceptance Time occurs during calendar year 2014, Parent shall
cause the Company to pay to each Continuing Employee who is a participant in
the Companys incentive plans listed on Section 6.7(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Incentive Plans_ ") immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time and who either (x) remains employed by Parent or its
Affiliates (including the Company) through December 31, 2014 or (y) is
terminated from employment by Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company)
on or after the Acceptance Date and prior to January 1, 2015 (other than for
just cause), an annual incentive amount in respect of the 2014 fiscal year
equal to no less than the applicable target level for each such employee (at
100% funding) (the " _FY 2014 Bonus_ "). Such FY2014 Bonus shall be paid at
the same time as would otherwise be payable pursuant to the terms of the
Incentive Plans.

(e) No later than the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary, including causing the adoption of resolutions of the
board of directors of the Company, to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan and to
cause each Continuing Employee to become 100% vested in such
Continuing Employees accounts under each Company 401(k) Plan, effective as
of no later than the day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time. The
Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions to terminate the
Company 401(k) Plan have been adopted by the board of directors of the
Company. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of Parent. As soon as administratively feasible after the
Acceptance Time, Parent agrees to take such actions necessary to permit
Continuing Employees to participate in the Merck U.S. Savings Plan (the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_") and the Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of MSD
(the " _Parent Cash Balance Plan_ "). Without limiting the undertakings in
Section 6.7(b), service by Continuing Employees for the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Acceptance Time shall be included, as applicable,
for vesting, eligibility and cash balance service points, but not for benefit
accruals, under the Parent 401(k) Plan and Parent Cash Balance Plan.

 



-44- (f) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA
or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan,
New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement (other than Section
6.7(e)), (ii) limit the right of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan, New
Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement following the Acceptance
Time, or (iii) create any third-party beneficiary or other right (including,
but not limited to, a right to employment) in any Person, including any
current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
any participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement
or arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof).

 

6.8 _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions
contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the Surviving
Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.5, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such expense.

 

6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law (and the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification), each present and former director and officer of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Parties service as a director, officer or employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the
request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions
to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") 

 



-45-  with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or
alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required, or the Company permitted, to expend for such policies
pursuant to this Section 6.9(b) an annualized premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annualized premium of such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.9 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation, certificate of formation or bylaws of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation or
bylaws of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 



-46- 6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

 

6.11 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting
through the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company)

Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates with current
or future directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Affiliates
pursuant to which payments are made or to be made or benefits are granted or
to be granted according to such arrangements (including any amendment or
modification thereof) to be approved as an "employment compensation,

_Exhibit A_ , which certificates only need to be capable of being delivered)
and the Regulatory Condition remains capable of being satisfied or waived,
then the Termination Date may be extended until March 9, 2015 at the election
of Parent or the Company by written notice to the other party (and such date
shall then be the Termination Date); or

(b) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Offer or the Merger shall become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) shall not be available to any party
whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth
in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the issuance,
promulgation, enforcement or entry of any such Order.

 

8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned by the Company:

(a) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) the board of directors of
the Company or any committee thereof authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and the Company
notifies Parent in writing (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") that it
intends to enter into such an agreement, which notice shall attach a copy of
all definitive agreements (including all financing documents )with respect to
such notice; (ii) if requested in writing by Parent, the Company shall have
discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with
Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the failure to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) would not be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the board of directors of the Company (and such Superior Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal) during the period beginning at
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Superior Proposal Notice and ending at the end of the Match Period ( _it_
_being_ _understood_ and hereby agreed that (1) such Match Period may be the
same Match Period contemplated by Section 6.2(c) if the Superior Proposal
Notice also serves as a Recommendation Change Notice) and (2) any amendment to
any material term or condition of the definitive agreements provided in the
Superior Proposal Notice shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice and a
new Match Period); (iii) no earlier than the end of the Match Period referred
to in clause (ii), the board of directors of the Company (or any committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation

 



-49-  with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), after considering the
terms of binding proposal to amend or modify this Agreement by Parent, that
such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that failure to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (iv) the Company immediately
prior to or concurrently with such termination pays to Parent in immediately
available funds any fees required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.5; and (v)
the board of directors of the Company approves, and the Company concurrently
with the termination enters into, a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of such Superior Proposal;

(b) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there has been a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or
Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall
have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, and such breach or
untruth (i) is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date, or if
curable, has not been cured within twenty (20) business days after receipt of
written notice thereof from the Company and (ii) impairs or would reasonably
be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall have given Parent at
least thirty (30) days written notice (or such shorter period of time as may
remain prior to the Termination Date) prior to such termination pursuant to
this Section 8.3(b); or

 

(c) if Merger Sub fails to commence the Offer on or prior to June 20, 2014 or
if Merger Sub fails to consummate the Offer in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) shall not be available to the
Company if the Company is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement that has been the cause of, or
resulted in, Merger Subs failure to commence the Offer on or prior to such
date.

 

8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned by Parent, notwithstanding the adoption of this Agreement by
Parent as sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

(a) if (i) the board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof
shall have made a Change of Recommendation or (ii) a tender or exchange offer
for Shares that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal) is commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent and, within
ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange
offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), the Company
shall not have filed a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act recommending that the Company stockholders
reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any Shares into such tender or
exchange offer;

 

(b) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there has been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in
this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, and such breach or untruth gives rise
to a failure of the Tender Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (3) or (4)
of _Exhibit A_ hereto to be satisfied and such breach or condition is
incapable of being cured by the Termination Date, or if curable, has not been
cured within twenty (20) business days after receipt of written notice
from Parent; _provided_ that Parent shall have given the Company at least
thirty (30) days written notice (or such shorter period of time as may remain
prior to the Termination Date) prior to such termination pursuant to
this Section 8.4(b); or

 



-50- 8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) below, in the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part
of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); 
_provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, that (i) except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages to the other
party hereto resulting from fraud or any breach of this Agreement and (ii)
the provisions set forth in this Section 8.5 and the second sentence of
Section 9.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and such Acquisition
Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have been publicly
withdrawn prior to the date of termination) and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b) or by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a);

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a); or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a);

 

then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) days after
the date of such termination, pay Parent a termination fee of
$115,600,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ " ); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
the Termination Fee to be paid pursuant to clause (iii) shall be paid as set
forth in Section 8.3(a) payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds; (B) no Termination Fee shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause
(i) of this paragraph (b) unless and until, within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
and such Acquisition Proposal is consummated (substituting "50%" for "15%" in
the definition thereof; and for the avoidance of doubt, such Acquisition
Proposal shall include any license (whether exclusive or non-exclusive)
pertaining to commercialization rights for the Key Product, IDX-21459 or
Samatasvir and such Termination Fee payable to Parent pursuant to clause (i)
of this paragraph (b) shall be payable promptly after the consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal (but in no event later than five (5) days after such
consummation) and (C) such Termination Fee payable to Parent pursuant to
clause (i) of this paragraph (b) shall be net of any Parent Expenses paid by
the Company to Parent pursuant to the immediately following sentence. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.2(a) by Parent
or the 

 



-51-  Company and at the time of such termination the only Tender Offer Conditions
that have not been satisfied or waived are the Minimum Condition and the
delivery of the certificates referenced in clause (5) of _Exhibit A_ , then
the Company shall reimburse Parent promptly upon demand, but in no event later
than two (2) business days after the date of such demand, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants)
(" _Parent Expenses_ ") incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall not be obligated to
reimburse Parent for Parent Expenses in excess of $5,000,000.
The reimbursement of Parent Expenses pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay any
applicable Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) (less the amount of
Parent Expenses previously reimbursed by the Company).

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amount set forth in Section 8.5(b) or any portion thereof, the Company
shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
Parents right to receive the Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses from the
Company pursuant to this Section 8.5 and Parents right to specific
performance pursuant to Section 9.4(c) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates
against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, directors,
officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement or the failure of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or
other Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event will the Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to both the payment of the
Termination Fee and specific performance of this Agreement. The parties hereto
expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i) upon any such termination of this
Agreement, the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b)
shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary damages of
Parent and Merger Sub arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any breach by the Company), the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and any claims or actions under applicable
Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure; and (ii) in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain any recovery or
judgment in excess of the Termination Fee (plus, in the case the
Termination Fee is not timely paid, the amounts described in the first
sentence of this Section 8.5(c)) against the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of their

 



-52-  respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, managers, members, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives or any of their respective assets, and in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain any other
damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any breach by the Company), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Offer, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or
actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 8.5(c) shall not limit the
right of the parties hereto to specific performance of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.4(c) prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Miscellaneous and General_

 

9.1 _Survival_. This Article IX and the agreements of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub contained in Article IV and Sections 6.7 (Employee Benefits), 6.8
(Expenses) and 6.9 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) shall
survive the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Article IX and the agreements of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 6.8 (Expenses) and Section
8.5 (Effect of Termination and Abandonment) and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement. All other representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the termination of this Agreement.

 

9.2 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time by an
instrument in writing signed by each party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Acceptance Time, no amendment shall be made that decreases the Per
Share Merger Consideration or that by Law requires approval by stockholders
of the Company without approval of such stockholders. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, may (but shall not be under any obligation
to) (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements of
the other or any of the conditions for its benefit contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be made no waiver that by Law
requires approval by stockholders of the Company without the approval of such
stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
such party. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder or
under applicable Law shall not constitute a waiver of such rights and, except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, no single or partial exercise by any
party of any of its rights hereunder precludes any other or further exercise
of such rights or any other rights hereunder or under applicable Law.

 



-53- 9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same
agreement.

9.4  _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO
ANOTHER JURISDICTION. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such
Court of Chancery shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal courts
of the United States of America located in the County of New Castle,
Delaware, solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of (and any claim or cause of action arising under or relating to)
this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree
not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims relating to such action, proceeding or transactions shall be heard
and determined in such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.5 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.4.

 



-54- (c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if said Court of Chancery shall lack
subject matter jurisdiction, any Federal court of the United States of America
located in the County of New Castle, Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event
that any action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives
the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each
party hereto further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 9.4(c), and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

between Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp. and the Company (as may be amended from time

-56- 9.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.9
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent and the
Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties
hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under
Section 6.9 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.2 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.8 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary

Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.9 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

9.11 _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit

 



-57-  to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that, Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights of
the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment
in violation of this Agreement is void.

including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or

delivered in satisfaction of such guarantee) that represents at least a
majority of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis as of the
Expiration Date (assuming the issuance of all Shares issuable upon the
exercise of all outstanding Company Options and other rights to purchase the
Shares) (such condition, the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii)(a) the waiting
period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer
and the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated and (b)
the authorization or confirmation set forth on Section 5.2(c)(i) of the

_Regulatory Condition_ "). In addition and notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be
required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay
for any Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer
(and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) if at any time on or
after the date of the commencement of the Offer and prior to the Expiration
Date, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing at
the Expiration Date:



     | (1) | this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms; 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that (a) is in effect and restrains, enjoins
or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) compels Parent or Merger
Sub to agree to or implement a NonRequired Remedy; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) |

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement that are qualified by reference to Company Material Adverse
Effect (other than the representations and warranties set forth in the first
and third sentences of Section 5.1(b) (Capital Structure) and Section
5.1(c)(i) (Corporate Authority)) shall not have been true and correct as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on
and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and

Exh. A-1 and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement that are not
qualified by reference to Company Material Adverse Effect (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in the first and third sentences of
Section 5.1(b) (Capital Structure) and Section 5.1(c)(i) (Corporate Authority)
shall not have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except
to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of
an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall
not have been true and correct as of such earlier date); provided, however,
that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the condition
set forth in this clause (3)(ii) shall be deemed to have been satisfied even
if any representations and warranties of the Company are not so true and
correct if the failure of such representations and warranties of the Company
to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted
in a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) the representations and
warranties set forth in the first and third sentences of Section 5.1(b)
(Capital Structure) and Section 5.1(c)(i) (Corporate Authority) shall not have
been true and correct in all respects, except for de minimis inaccuracies, as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on
and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and correct as
of such earlier date);

     | (4) | the Company shall not have performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement
at or prior to the Expiration Date; or 
---|---|---

the Expiration Date a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior
executive officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth
in clauses (3) and (4) have been satisfied as of immediately prior to the
Expiration Date. 
---|---|--- 

The foregoing conditions shall be for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger
Sub and may be asserted or waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part
at any time and from time to time, in each case, except for the Minimum
Condition and the Regulatory Condition, subject to the terms of this
Agreement and applicable Law. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer subject to, and in
accordance with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any Shares
subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly
tendered for purposes of satisfying the Minimum Condition unless and until the
Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on
behalf of Merger Sub. Any reference in this _Exhibit A_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be
satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. Capitalized terms
used but not defined in this _Exhibit A_ shall have the meaning ascribed to
them elsewhere in this Agreement to which this _Exhibit A_ is attached.
