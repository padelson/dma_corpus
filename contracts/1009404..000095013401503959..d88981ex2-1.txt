Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance

A hereto (the "Tender Offer Conditions") shall have occurred and are
continuing, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but
in any event not later than seven (7) Business Days after the first public
announcement of the execution and delivery of this Agreement), Sub shall
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) the Offer. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be
the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the date the Offer is commenced
within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act. The obligation of
Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Ordinary Shares tendered in the
Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject only to the Tender Offer Conditions,
any of which, subject to the proviso below, may be waived by Parent or Sub in
whole or in part in their sole discretion. The Tender Offer Conditions are
for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and may be asserted by Parent and Sub
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such Tender Offer
Conditions. Parent and Sub expressly reserve the right to modify the terms of
the Offer, provided, however, that neither Parent nor Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Sub not to), without the prior written consent of the Company,
(i) reduce the number of Ordinary Shares to be purchased pursuant to the
Offer, (ii) reduce the Ordinary Share Offer Price, (iii) impose any
additional conditions to the Offer, (iv) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (v) make any change to the terms of the Offer,
including without limitation the Tender Offer Conditions, which is materially
adverse in any manner to the holders of the Ordinary Shares, (vi) amend or
waive the Minimum Condition, except that Parent or Sub may, at any time,
amend the Minimum Condition to equal the number of Ordinary Shares
representing a majority of the total number of votes of the outstanding
Ordinary Shares on a fully-diluted basis or (vii) extend the expiration date
of the Offer, provided, however, that Parent or Sub may extend the expiration
date of the Offer: (A) as required by any rule, regulation or interpretation
of the Commission; or (B) in the event that any condition to the Offer is not
satisfied and, to the extent permitted herein, is not waived as of the
scheduled expiration date of the Offer, for such successive periods for up to
ten (10) Business Days at a time (or such longer period as shall be
approved by the Company) until the earlier of the acceptance for payment of
any Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Offer or the date (the "Offer Termination
Date") that is sixty (60) days from the date of commencement of the Offer.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Company may
require Sub to extend the Offer on one occasion for a maximum period of ten
(10) days if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Tender Offer
Conditions (assuming for this purpose that the Minimum Condition has not been
amended in accordance with clause (vi) of the proviso contained above in this
Section 2.1(a)) have not been satisfied. In addition, notwithstanding
anything in this Section 2.1(a) to the contrary, if not already disclosed in
the Offer to Purchase (as defined below), Parent and Sub may amend the
Schedule TO (as defined below) to permit the announcement of a subsequent
offering period (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1 promulgated under the
Exchange Act (the "Subsequent Offer      8  13  Period")) to the
Offer, and Sub may include a Subsequent Offer Period to the Offer for up to a
maximum of twenty (20) Business Days.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Sub amends the Minimum Condition as permitted by Section 2.1(a) of this
Agreement and accepts Ordinary Shares tendered and not withdrawn for payment
pursuant to the terms of the Offer, then (i) Sub may make available a
Subsequent Offer Period by extending the Offer on one occasion for up to a
maximum of twenty (20) Business Days if, on the expiration date of the
initial period of the Offer, the number of Ordinary Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer represent less than the amount of
Ordinary Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition (assuming for this
purpose it has not been amended in accordance with clause (vi) of the proviso
contained in Section 2.1(a)), notwithstanding that all other Tender Offer
Conditions have been satisfied and (ii) the Company may require Sub to make a
Subsequent Offer Period available to the holders of Ordinary Shares
by extending the Offer on one occasion, for up to a maximum of twenty (20)
Business Days. If at any expiration date of the Offer, (i) the number of
Ordinary Shares validly tendered into and not withdrawn from the Offer,
including all Ordinary Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn from the
Offer by the Principal Shareholders (including, for this purpose the
conditional surrender for conversion of, and tender of Ordinary Shares
issuable upon conversion of, Preferred Shares in accordance with the
Principal Shareholders Agreement) will result in the Minimum Condition being
satisfied and (ii) all other Tender Offer Conditions have been satisfied or
waived, Sub shall be obligated to accept for payment and pay for all such
Ordinary Shares so tendered. If Sub accepts for payment any Ordinary Shares
in the Offer, Parent or Sub shall pay for all of the Ordinary Shares tendered
and not withdrawn in the Offer as soon as practicable after the scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, as it may be extended pursuant to this
Agreement, but in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after
the date Parent or Sub accept for payment such Ordinary Shares and shall pay
for all Ordinary Shares tendered in the Subsequent Offer Period,
if applicable, promptly after such Ordinary Shares are tendered.   (c) As

consideration to be received pursuant to the Offer and either the proposed

by the holders of Shares (other than Parent or any direct or indirect

the assumptions and qualifications contained in such opinion (a complete and
correct executed copy of such opinion has been, or promptly upon receipt

and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by the Exchange Act.
Parent and Sub and their counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to

each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with information
with respect to any oral comments and with copies of any written comments the
Company or its counsel may receive from the Commission or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and
shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to

thereof to the Commission, including the opportunity to participate with the
Company or its counsel in any discussions with the Commission or its
staff.   (d) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly

security position listings and any available listing or computer list
containing, as of the most recent practicable date, the names and addresses
of the record holders of Shares and shall furnish Sub with such additional
information (including, but not limited to, updated lists of holders of
Shares and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions)
and such other assistance as Sub or its agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements
of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate

Offer, the Compulsory Acquisition and the Scheme of Arrangement, Sub shall
hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer, the
Compulsory Acquisition and the Scheme of Arrangement and, if this Agreement
is terminated, shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information in
its possession.   (e) The Company represents and warrants that it has been
advised that each of its directors and executive officers intends to tender
pursuant to the Offer all Ordinary Shares owned of record and beneficially by
him or her except to the extent such tender would violate applicable
securities laws.     11  16   Section 2.3 Composition of the Board of
Directors. (a) Promptly upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by
Sub for, Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Offer, Sub shall be entitled to
designate, subject to Section 2.3(c) of this Agreement, up to such number of
directors ("Parent Designees") on the Board of Directors of the Company,
rounded up to the next whole number, as shall give Sub, subject to compliance
with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder,
representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to at least
that number of directors which equals the product of the total number of
directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of votes represented by the
Ordinary Shares (determined on an as-converted basis assuming that all then-
outstanding Preferred Shares owned by Parent and Sub are converted into
Ordinary Shares) beneficially owned by Sub and Parent and the denominator of
which shall be the aggregate number of votes represented by the Ordinary
Shares (determined on an as-converted basis assuming that all then-
outstanding Preferred Shares are converted into Ordinary Shares) then issued
and outstanding, and the Company and its Board of Directors shall, at such
time, take any and all such action necessary to cause Parent Designees to be
appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in such class of directors
(if any) as shall ensure the longest possible term for such Parent Designees
(including using commercially reasonable efforts to cause relevant directors
to resign and/or increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the Company
(subject to the limitations set forth in the Company\'s Memorandum of
Association and the Company\'s Articles of Association)). The Company shall
take all action required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1, promulgated thereunder, to effect the election of such Parent
Designees, including (i) mailing to its shareholders the information required
by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder or
(ii) including such information in the Schedule 14D-9 filed with the
Commission and distributed to the shareholders of the Company, and
the Company agrees to make such mailing so long as Sub shall have provided to
the Company, on a timely basis, all information required by Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder with respect to the
Parent Designees. Parent and Sub shall be solely responsible for any
information with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers,
directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Upon
acceptance for payment of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Offer (the date
Ordinary Shares are first accepted for payment, the "Acceptance Date"), the
Company, if so requested, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Persons designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage of each
committee of its Board of Directors, each Board of Directors of each
Subsidiary and each committee of each such Board of Directors (in each case
to the extent of the Company\'s ability to elect such Persons) as the
percentage of the full Board of Directors of the Company that the Parent
Designees constitutes.   (b) The provisions of Section 2.3(a) are in
addition to, and shall not limit any, rights which Parent, Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates may have as holders or beneficial owners of
Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.   (c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section 2.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that at least two (2) of the members of the
Board of Directors shall, at all times prior to: (i) if Parent or Sub
requests a Scheme of Arrangement pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof, the
earlier to occur of (A) the Scheme      12  17  Effective Time or (B)
the date on which either (x) the Court declines to sanction the Scheme of
Arrangement, (y) the Company\'s shareholders do not approve the Scheme of
Arrangement at any meeting duly called for such purpose or (z) Parent and Sub
abandon the Scheme of Arrangement; (ii) if Parent and Sub are required to
effect a Compulsory Acquisition pursuant to Section 6.4, the earlier to occur
of (A) the date of completion of the Compulsory Acquisition (the "Compulsory
Completion Date") or (B) the date on which either (x) the Court, pursuant to
an application made by a dissenting shareholder, grants an order preventing
the acquisition of the applicant\'s shares pursuant to Section 88 of the
Companies Law or (y) Parent and Sub abandon the Compulsory Acquisition;
and (iii) the date which is thirty (30) Business Days after the Acceptance
Date if Parent and Sub are not required to effect a Compulsory Acquisition
pursuant to Section 6.4 and Parent or Sub does not request a Scheme of
Arrangement pursuant to Section 3.1 on or before such date, (the applicable
date being referred to herein as the "Discontinuance Date"), be Persons who
are directors of the Company on the date hereof (the "Continuing Directors"),
provided that, if there shall be in office less than two (2) Continuing
Directors, the Board of Directors may cause the Person designated by the
remaining Continuing Director or Continuing Directors to fill such vacancy,
and such Person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes
of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall designate two (2) Persons to
fill such vacancies who will not be officers, employees or Affiliates of the
Company or Parent, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Following the election or
appointment of the Parent Designees pursuant to this Section 2.3 and prior to
the Discontinuance Date, any amendment of this Agreement, any proposal to
shareholders to amend the Company\'s Memorandum of Association or
the Company\'s Articles of Association, any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Parent and Sub or waiver of any of
the Company\'s rights hereunder, and any other consent or action by the
Company hereunder, shall require the concurrence of a majority of the
Continuing Directors, if there are more than two (2) Continuing Directors, or
the concurrence of one (1) Continuing Director, if there are two (2)
Continuing Directors. In connection therewith, the Continuing Directors shall
be authorized, on behalf and at the expense of the Company, to retain
financial and legal advisors.   ARTICLE III   THE SCHEME OF
ARRANGEMENT   Section 3.1 The Scheme of Arrangement. (a) Subject to Section
6.4, promptly following the Acceptance Date and, if applicable, the
Subsequent Offer Period, or the expiration of the Offer without the purchase
of any Ordinary Shares thereunder, (A) if the Offer has remained open for a
minimum of twenty (20) Business Days, plus any extension of the expiration
date of the Offer (up to an additional ten (10) days) that has been required
by the Company in accordance with Section 2.1, and (B) if requested by Parent
or Sub, in its sole discretion, the Company shall, unless precluded from
doing so by any applicable law, or otherwise agreed to in writing by Sub,
take the respective actions set forth in this Article III to effectuate the
Scheme of Arrangement, subject to the terms and conditions herein.   (b) On
the Scheme Effective Date at the Scheme Effective Time, and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, and subject to the Grand Court of the
Cayman Islands      13  18  (the "Court") exercising its discretion
and sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement (the "Scheme of Arrangement")
pursuant to Section 86(2) of the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision), as
amended, of the Cayman Islands (the "Companies Law") and making such
facilitating orders as are appropriate pursuant to Section 87 of the
Companies Law, all of the issued share capital of the Company shall be
transferred to Sub.   Section 3.2 Application to the Court; Effective Time
of the Scheme of Arrangement; Scheme of Arrangement Closing. (a) Subject to
Section 6.4, promptly following the Acceptance Date and, if applicable, the
Subsequent Offer Period, or the expiration of the Offer without the purchase
of any Ordinary Shares thereunder, (A) if the Offer has remained open for a
minimum of twenty (20) Business Days, plus any extension of the expiration
date (up to an additional ten (10) days) that has been required by the
Company in accordance with Section 2.1, and (B) if requested by Parent or
Sub, in its sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law, the
Company shall (i) cause an application to be made to the Court requesting the
Court to summon such class meetings of shareholders of the Company as the
Court may direct ("Shareholders\' Meetings"), (ii) if directed by the Court,
convene such Shareholders\' Meetings seeking the approval required under
Section 86(2) of the Companies Law and (iii) subject to such approvals being
obtained, cause a petition to be presented to the Court seeking the
sanctioning of a Scheme of Arrangement pursuant to Section 86 of
the Companies Law and file such other documents as are required to be duly
filed with the Court to effect the Scheme of Arrangement. The Company shall,
if necessary, hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders,
subject to the Scheme of Arrangement taking full force and effect, to approve
and adopt new Articles of Association of the Company that shall be
substantially identical to Sub\'s articles of association, except as
otherwise required by Section 6.9 hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Company shall take all action necessary to solicit from its shareholders
proxies, and shall take all other action necessary and advisable to secure
the vote of shareholders required by the Companies Law and by the Memorandum
of Association of the Company or the Articles of Association of the Company
to obtain approval of the Scheme of Arrangement. Except as provided in
Section 6.6 of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
recommend that the holders of Shares vote in favor of the approval of the
Scheme of Arrangement at the Shareholders\' Meetings, and, except as provided
in Section 6.6, the Company agrees that it shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors that the shareholders
of the Company adopt this Agreement and approve the Scheme of Arrangement.
Parent shall cause all Shares owned by Parent and its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries (including Sub) to be voted in favor of approval of such Scheme
of Arrangement.   (b) As promptly as practicable following Parent\'s
request, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the Commission a
preliminary proxy statement or information statement (together with any
amendment or supplement thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and shall promptly
use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the
Commission, if any, in connection therewith and to furnish all information
regarding the Company that is required in the definitive Proxy Statement
(including, without limitation, financial statements and supporting schedules
and certificates and reports of independent public accountants). Parent, Sub
and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and Sub shall furnish to the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the
definitive      14  19  Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
shareholders of the Company and, if necessary, after the definitive Proxy
Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental
or supplemented proxy material and, if required in connection therewith,
resolicit proxies. The Company shall not use any proxy material in connection
with the meeting of its shareholders without Parent\'s prior approval, except
as required by law or the Commission.   If deemed necessary or advisable by
Parent, for purposes of the hearing by the Court of the petition to sanction
the Scheme of Arrangement, the parties shall hold a pre-closing (the "Scheme
Pre-Closing") on the Business Day prior to the day of such hearing (or such
earlier time as reasonably requested by Parent if necessary to prepare and
file any affidavit in connection with such hearing) for the purpose of
determining which of the conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied as
of such date, it being understood that the determination that any such
condition is satisfied as of such date shall not constitute a determination
or agreement by any party that such condition is satisfied as of the Scheme
Closing Date. The Scheme Pre-Closing shall be held at a location designated
by Parent.   (c) As soon as practicable after receipt of an order from
the Court sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement, the parties shall convene at
a location designated by Parent for the purpose of confirming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII (the "Scheme Closing
Date"). The closing of the Scheme of Arrangement (the "Scheme Closing") shall
be deemed to occur if all conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied
(other than any such condition which has been waived) and all of the actions
described in this Article III that are necessary to consummate a Scheme of
Arrangement have occurred. The Company, Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree
that all the conditions set forth in Article VII must be satisfied (or
waived) as of such time, and all of the actions described in this Article III
that are necessary to consummate a Scheme of Arrangement shall have occurred
as of such time, whether or not any such condition was determined to be
satisfied or occurred as of the Scheme Pre-Closing, if held.   (d) As soon
as practicable following the Scheme Closing, the Company shall cause a copy
of the Court order sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement to be duly delivered
to the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands (the "Registrar") and the
Scheme of Arrangement shall become effective as soon as a copy of the Court
order sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement has been duly delivered to the
Registrar for registration and the order and minutes have been registered by
him (the date of such registration being the "Scheme Effective Date" and the
time of such registration being the "Scheme Effective Time").   (e)
Notwithstanding paragraph (d), if the Company and Parent so agree in writing,
and the same is consistent with any order of the Court sanctioning the Scheme
of Arrangement, the Company shall cause a copy of the order to be delivered
to the Registrar prior to the Scheme Closing, and the Scheme Closing shall be
held as soon as practicable thereafter, in which case the Scheme of
Arrangement shall become effective only after both (i) a copy of the Court
order sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement is delivered to the Registrar for
registration and the order and minutes have been registered by the Registrar
and (ii) the Scheme Closing shall have occurred. In such
case, notwithstanding paragraph (d), for all purposes hereunder, the Scheme
Effective Date shall be the date on which the Scheme Closing shall have
occurred and the Scheme Effective Time shall be the time at which the Scheme
Closing is deemed by the parties to be completed.     15  20   (f) As
of the Scheme Effective Time, the Company shall be a directly wholly owned
Subsidiary of Sub.   Section 3.3 Terms of the Scheme: Transfer of Share
Capital. (a) At the Scheme Effective Time, by virtue of the Scheme of
Arrangement:   (i) Each Ordinary Share (and the associated Rights) issued 
and outstanding immediately prior to the Scheme Effective Time  (other than
Ordinary Shares (and the associated Right) which are  held by any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the  treasury of the Company, or which
are held, directly or  indirectly, by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
(including Sub)  (the "Scheme Ordinary Shares") shall be, by virtue of the
Scheme  of Arrangement and without any action required by the holder 
thereof (the "Holder"), transferred to Sub in consideration for  U.S.$45.00
in cash per Scheme Ordinary Share transferred  ("Ordinary Cash
Consideration").   (ii) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time (other than Preferred Shares which 
are held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the  treasury of
the Company, or which are held, directly or  indirectly, by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (including  Sub)) (the "Scheme Preferred Shares" and
together with the Scheme  Ordinary Shares, the "Scheme Shares") shall be, by
virtue of the  Scheme of Arrangement and without any action required by the 
Holder thereof, transferred to Sub in consideration for  U.S.$180.00 in cash
per Scheme Preferred Share, plus any  accumulated and unpaid dividends
thereon through the Scheme  Effective Date (the "Preferred Cash
Consideration" and together  with the Ordinary Cash Consideration, the "Cash
Consideration").   (b) At the Scheme Effective Time, regardless of whether
a certificate for Scheme Shares shall be surrendered for exchange,
all certificates for Scheme Shares shall be deemed cancelled and the holders
thereof shall cease to have any rights by virtue thereof, other than to
receive the Cash Consideration set forth herein. All Cash Consideration paid
upon the deemed cancellation of certificates for Scheme Shares shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Scheme Shares.   Section 3.4 Terms of the Scheme of Arrangement;
Payment. (a) Subject to and by virtue of the order of the Court under Section
86(2) of the Companies Law sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement, the terms
of the Scheme of Arrangement and the provisions for cancellation or surrender
of the certificates representing the Scheme Shares shall be as set forth in
the Scheme of Arrangement.   (b) Prior to the Scheme Effective Time, Parent
or Sub shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Exchange Agent").   (c) At the Scheme Effective
Time, Parent or Sub shall provide the Exchange Agent in immediately available
funds in U.S. dollars all funds necessary to pay the Cash Consideration (the
"Payment Fund"). As soon as possible after the Scheme Effective Time, and in
no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Scheme Effective Date,
Parent or Sub      16  21  shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent,
to send to each Holder at the address appearing in the register of members of
the Company (the "Registered Address") on the date immediately preceding the
Scheme Effective Date (the "Record Date") a bank cheque in immediately
available funds in U.S. dollars representing each such Holder\'s Cash
Consideration. The payment required to be sent by Parent or Sub, or the
Exchange Agent on their behalf, to the Holders pursuant to the Scheme of
Arrangement shall be sent by mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the
Holders entitled thereto at their respective Registered Address, and
Parent and Sub shall not be responsible for any loss or delay in transmission
posted in accordance with this Section 3.4(c). No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the Cash Consideration. Until the monies held in the Payment Fund
are paid to the Holders in accordance with this Section 3.4(c), Parent and
Sub shall cause the Exchange Agent to invest the Payment Fund as directed by
them. All earnings on investments made with the Payment Fund shall be paid to
Parent or, at its direction, to Sub. If for any reason the Payment Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which Holders are entitled under this
Section 3.4(c), Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, promptly restore
such amount of inadequacy to the Payment Fund, and in any event shall be
fully liable for payment thereof. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the Holders for nine months after the Scheme
Effective Time shall be delivered to Sub, upon demand, and any Holder who has
not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
the Parent for payment of its claim for Cash Consideration.   (d) The
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Cash
Consideration otherwise payable to any Holder pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under any law.   Section 3.5 Stock Option and Other
Plans. (a) The Company may provide and, if requested by Parent, shall provide
to the extent permitted by applicable law and the provisions of the
applicable Options and Stock Plans, that all outstanding stock options and
other rights to purchase Ordinary Shares (the "Options") heretofore granted
under any stock option or similar plan of the Company (the "Stock Plans") or
otherwise shall vest and be fully exercisable, effective immediately prior to
expiration of the Offer which results in an Acceptance Date if the Option
holder (i) tenders all Options held by such holder for exercise (conditioned
only upon occurrence of the Acceptance Date) and tenders and does not
withdraw all Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of such Options in the
Offer or (ii) irrevocably surrenders all Options held by such holder to the
Company between the final expiration date of the Offer (including any
Subsequent Offer Period) if an Acceptance Date occurs with respect to
the Offer and the earlier of the Compulsory Completion Date and the Scheme
Effective Time for cancellation in exchange for a Cash Option Payment as
provided in Section 3.5(c) hereof.   (b) The Company may make arrangements
and, if requested by Parent, shall make such arrangements to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the provisions of the applicable Options and
Stock Plans, to permit holders of Options to conditionally exercise their
Options and tender all Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise thereof in the
Offer. The Company, Parent and Sub agree that Sub shall accept as validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer all Ordinary Shares which are to be issued
pursuant to the Conditional Option Exercise (as defined below). "Conditional
Option Exercise" shall mean the exercise of all Options that are duly
surrendered to the Company for exercise, conditional only on the occurrence
of the Acceptance Date, and    17  22  accompanied by appropriate
irrevocable instructions that the Ordinary Shares issuable upon such exercise
shall be deemed to be exercised immediately prior to the expiration of the
Offer and properly tendered to Sub pursuant to the terms of the Offer and not
withdrawn.   (c) From and after the Acceptance Date until the earlier of
the Compulsory Completion Date and the Scheme Effective Time, the Company
may permit, with Parent\'s prior approval, and, if requested by Parent, shall
permit, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the provisions of the
applicable Options and Stock Plans, each holder of an outstanding Option, in
cancellation and settlement therefor, to receive payments from the Company in
cash (the "Cash Option Payment") equal to the product of (x) the total number
of Ordinary Shares subject to such Option, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, and (y) the amount by which the Ordinary Share Offer Price
exceeds the exercise price per Ordinary Share subject to such Option, each
such Cash Option Payment to be paid to each holder of an outstanding Option
upon (i) surrender to the Company of the Option and (ii) an appropriate
surrender and release agreement providing that such surrender and payment of
the Cash Option Payment shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the
holder had or may have had in respect of such Option. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 3.5 to the contrary, payment of the Cash
Option Payment may be withheld with respect to any Option until necessary
consents and releases are obtained.   (d) Upon the earlier of the Scheme
Effective Time or the Compulsory Completion Date, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and the provisions of the applicable Options and Stock Plans,
the Company shall permit each holder of an outstanding Option, in
cancellation and settlement therefor, to receive Cash Option Payments equal
to the product of (x) the total number of Ordinary Shares subject to such
Option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, and (y) the amount by
which the Ordinary Share Offer Price exceeds the exercise price per Ordinary
Share subject to such Option, each such Cash Option Payment to be paid to
each holder of an outstanding Option upon (i) surrender to the Company of the
Option and (ii) an appropriate surrender and release agreement providing that
such surrender and payment of the Cash Option Payment shall be deemed a
release of any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of
such Option. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.5 to the
contrary, payment of the Cash Option Payment may be withheld with respect to
any Option until necessary consents and releases are obtained.   (e) Subject
to the rights of holders of Options under Section 3.5(d), the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall
use its best efforts to obtain all necessary consents and releases from all
of the holders of all the outstanding Options, and shall use its best
efforts, to the extent permitted without resulting in a breach or violation
thereof, to take all actions to (i) terminate, at the earlier of
the Compulsory Completion Date or the Scheme Effective Time, the Stock Plans
and Options and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the share capital of
the Company or any Affiliate thereof (collectively with the Stock Plans,
referred to as the "Stock Incentive Plans") and (ii) amend, as of the earlier
of the Compulsory Completion Date or the Scheme Effective Time and to the

WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Section 4 Representations and Warranties of the
Company. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as
follows:   Section 4.1 Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated
(or, if not a corporation, duly organized), validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation (or, if not
a corporation, organization) and each such Person has all requisite
corporate, partnership or other power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had, does
not have, and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has,
prior to the date of this Agreement, made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of the Company\'s current Memorandum of Association, as
amended, and current Articles of Association and the comparable governing
documents of each of its material Subsidiaries, in each case as amended and
in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.   Section 4.2
Authorization and Validity of this Agreement. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Principal Shareholders Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder, and
thereunder and (subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company if
required by the Companies Law) to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Principal Shareholders Agreement by the Company, and the consummation by it
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
duly authorized and approved by its Board of Directors, and no other
corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Principal
Shareholders Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (subject to the approval of the
shareholders of the Company if required by the Companies Law). This Agreement
and the Principal Shareholders Agreement have been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming that this Agreement and the Principal
Shareholders Agreement constitute valid and binding obligations of Parent and
Sub, constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally and by general equitable principles.   Section

violation of, any preemptive rights. Except as set forth above or on Schedule

its Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to issue Shares of its capital or
any securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for, any Shares of the capital of the Company or any of its

Person on any matter. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3(c) of the Company

entire Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith,
after receiving advice from Cayman Islands counsel to the Company, that it is
necessary to take such actions in order to comply with the fiduciary duties

the foregoing, Parent, Sub and the Company agree that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.6(a) by any Affiliate,
officer, director, employee, representative, consultant, investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other agent of the Company or any of its Affiliates,
whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or

the entire Board of Directors of the Company based on the written advice of
an independent nationally recognized investment bank) reasonably determines
in good faith to have a higher value than the consideration to be received by
the shareholders of the Company (in their capacity as such) than the
transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent the transactions contemplated

behalf of the Company, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have such information returned.   Section 6.7 Notification of
Certain Matters. Parent and the Company shall promptly notify each other of
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event which has caused or
could reasonably likely cause (a) any representation or warranty made by it

Agreement, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the earliest of the Acceptance Date, the Compulsory
Completion Date, the Scheme Effective Time and the expiration of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of individuals who on or prior to such date were
directors or officers of the Company, unless such modification is required by
law. The      45  50  Company shall honor in accordance with their
terms, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all indemnity
agreements set forth in Schedule 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of any Continuing Director, the
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability set
forth in the Company\'s Memorandum of Association, as amended, and Articles
of Association, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the

the Acceptance Date, the Compulsory Completion Date, the Scheme Effective
Time and the expiration of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, (i) the
Company shall maintain in effect the Company\'s current directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently
covered on the date of this Agreement by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy (the "Indemnified Parties"); provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company be required to expend in any one
year an amount in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%), of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance which the
Company represents to be $581,800 for the twelve month period ending on June
30, 2002; provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount; and provided, further, that the Company may substitute for such
Company policies other policies with at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous, and provided that said
substitution does not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect
to matters occurring prior to the earliest of the Acceptance Date,
the Compulsory Completion Date, the Scheme Effective Date and the expiration
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, or (ii) at such time as Parent
directly or indirectly through Sub, owns the entire share capital of the
Company, the Company or Parent may cause Parent\'s, directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance then in effect to cover the Indemnified
Parties with respect to those matters covered by the Company\'s directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance policy so long as the terms thereof are no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries thereof than the Company\'s
current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering the
Indemnified Parties. If the Company elects clause (i) of the previous
sentence and such directors\' and officers\' liability insurance is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period, then Parent at such time
as Parent directly or indirectly through Sub, owns the entire share capital
of the Company, will use all reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as
much directors\' and officers\' insurance as can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
maximum premium specified above, on terms and conditions no less advantageous
to the Indemnified Parties than such insurance that shall have expired.  
(c) Company shall and, at any time that Parent owns directly or indirectly
the entire share capital of the Company, Parent shall indemnify
all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals\'

of its Subsidiaries or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit
of employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and occurring at or
prior to the earliest of the Acceptance Date, the Compulsory Completion Date,
the Scheme Effective Date and the expiration of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1, including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by
the     46  51  Transaction Documents. Without limitation of the
foregoing, in the event any such Indemnified Party is or becomes involved, in
any capacity, in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with
any matter, including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents, occurring prior to and including the earliest of
the Acceptance Date, the Compulsory Completion Date, the Scheme Effective
Time and the expiration of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the
Company, and at such time as Parent owns the entire share capital of the
Company, Parent from and after such date, shall pay, as incurred, such
Indemnified Party\'s reasonable legal and other expenses (including the cost
of any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith.
Subject to Section 6.9(d) below, Parent and the Company shall pay
all reasonable expenses, including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by
any Indemnified Party in enforcing this Section 6.9 or any action involving
an Indemnified Party resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 6.9, upon learning
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly
notify Parent and the Company thereof. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the earliest of the Acceptance Date, the Compulsory Completion Date, the
Scheme Effective Date and the expiration of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1), (i) the Company shall have the right, from and after such date,
and Parent shall have the right at any time that it owns the entire share
capital of the Company, to assume the defense thereof (with counsel engaged
by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to be reasonably acceptable to
the relevant Indemnified Party and Parent, if applicable, and the Company
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) such Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent, if applicable,
and the Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided that Parent, if applicable and the Company shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law. Parent, if applicable, and the Company shall not enter into
any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release
from all liability in respect of such matter.   (e) Notwithstanding any
other provisions hereof, the obligations of the Company and Parent contained
in this Section 6.9 shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
Parent and the Company. In the event Parent or the Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that successors and assigns of Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.   (f)
IT IS EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES TO WHOM THIS SECTION 6.9
APPLIES SHALL BE THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS SECTION 6.9, EACH OF WHOM
MAY ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 6.9.     47  52   Section
6.10 Rights Agreement. Other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement,
the Company shall not (i) redeem the Rights, (ii) amend (other than to delay
the "Distribution Date" (as defined therein) or to render the
Rights inapplicable to the Offer and the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents) or terminate the Rights Agreement prior to the
Effective Time, unless required to do so by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or (iii) take any action which would allow any "Person" (as
such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) other than Parent or Sub to be
the "Beneficial Owner" (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) of
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the Ordinary Shares without causing a
"Distribution Date" (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) or a
"Share Acquisition Date" (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) to
occur.   Section 6.11 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation and review by the other party of such
release or statement, or without the prior consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or
make such public statement as may be required by law or by any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange or automated quotation system
to which Parent or any Affiliate of Parent or, as the case may be, the
Company is a party, if it has used all commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party and to obtain such party\'s consent, but has
been unable to do so in a timely manner.   Section 6.12 Benefit Plans;
Vacation; Employment Agreements. (a) Parent shall take such action as may be
necessary so that on and after the earlier of the Compulsory Completion Date
and the Scheme Effective Date (it being understood that Parent shall have no
obligation under this Section 6.12(a) if neither of such dates occurs) and
for one year thereafter, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be provided employee benefits, plans and programs
(including but not limited to incentive compensation, deferred compensation,
pension, life insurance, medical (which eligibility shall not be subject to
any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such individual has met the
participation requirements of such benefits, plans or programs of the Company
or its Subsidiaries), profit sharing (including 401(k), severance, salary
continuation and fringe benefits)) which are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those generally available to similarly situated officers and
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, except with respect to the benefits
available under the Severance Policy. For purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting in all benefits provided to officers and employees,
the officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be
credited with their years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and prior employers to the extent service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries and prior employers is taken into account under plans of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Upon termination of any health plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, individuals who were officers or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries at the earliest to occur of the
Compulsory Completion Date or the Scheme Effective Date (it being understood
that Parent shall have no obligation hereunder if it does not own the entire
share capital of the Company) shall, if employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, become eligible to participate in such health plans established
by Parent (or existing plans maintained by the Company which satisfy the
first sentence of this Section 6.12(a)). Amounts      48  53  paid
before the earliest to occur of the Compulsory Completion Date and the Scheme
Effective Date by officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under any health plans of the Company shall after such date be taken into
account in applying deductible and out-of-pocket limits applicable under the
health plans of Parent provided as of such date to the same extent as if such
amounts had been paid under such health plans of Parent.   (b) Following the
earlier to occur of the Compulsory Completion Date and the Scheme Effective
Date, Parent shall permit and shall cause the Company to permit all
individuals who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to such date to retain and take any paid vacation days accrued but not
taken or lost under the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' vacation policies
prior to such date, provided that such vacation days are taken or paid in
lieu of being taken within one year after such date.   (c) The parties
hereto agree that, upon the Acceptance Date, a "change in control, " "change
of control" or "consolidation" as applicable, shall be deemed to have
occurred in respect of each of the employment agreements, change in control
agreements and severance agreements and other employee benefit plans and
agreements set forth on Schedule 6.12 (c) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the "Severance Protection Plans") and each of the Company and
Parent shall administer and perform its obligations under each Severance
Protection Plan as if a "change in control" or "change of control" shall have
occurred as of the Acceptance Date, notwithstanding any terms contained
therein to the contrary. This Section 6.12(c) shall not affect any terms of,
or otherwise imply that the Acceptance Date shall not constitute a "change in
control" or "change of control" under, any employment agreement, change in
control agreement, severance agreement or other employee benefit plan or
agreement that is not listed on such Schedule 6.12.   (d) From and after the
date on which Sub becomes the beneficial owner (as determined under Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company representing 90%
or more of the votes entitled to vote in the election of directors of the
Company (the "Succession Date"), Parent shall, jointly and severally with the
Company, (i) be liable to pay and perform the obligations of the Company
under the Severance Protection Plans and (ii) take such action as may be
necessary to promptly pay any severance payments or other amounts from time
to time due thereunder.   (e) From and after the Acceptance Date, the
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, maintain the Severance
Policy in full force and effect (without modification or amendment thereof,
except to the extent that any such modification or amendment does not
adversely affect any Person covered by the Severance Policy) at least until
the first anniversary of the Acceptance Date in respect of all Persons
covered by the Severance Policy as of the Offer Closing.   (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.12, no current or
former employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall have any right
to employment or continued employment with the Company or any Affiliate
following the Acceptance Date.   Section 6.13 Agreements Relating to
Preferred Shares(a) Parent and Sub agree that if an Acceptance Date occurs,
then Sub shall, and Parent shall take such action (including without   
49  54  limitation exercising any rights under the Principal Shareholders
Agreement) as necessary to cause Sub to, accept for payment and pay for
pursuant to the Offer (i) all Ordinary Shares held by the Principal
Shareholders and (ii) all Ordinary Shares that immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer are issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares
held by the Principal Shareholders.   (b) Parent and Sub agree that if Sub
purchases any Preferred Shares from any Principal Shareholder, then Parent
and Sub shall not take any action, and shall take all such actions as are
commercially reasonable to cause any Parent Designees to act accordingly, to
prevent the Company from exercising its right to redeem the Preferred Shares
in accordance with the terms thereof.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS

has formed an independent judgment concerning, the other party and its
Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, and such party has
requested such documents and information from the other party as such party
considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Each of Parent
and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, acknowledge and
agree that it has had an opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers

determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.   (b) The respective
representations and warranties of the Company, on the one hand, and each of
Parent and Sub, on the other hand, contained herein or in any certificates or

businesses and operations, each party and its representatives have received
from the other party or its representatives certain projections and other
forecasts for the other party and its Subsidiaries and certain estimates,
plans and budget information. Each party acknowledges and agrees that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans and budgets; that such party is familiar with such
uncertainties; that such party is taking full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it or its representatives; and
that such party will not (and will cause all of its respective Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates or any other person acting on its behalf to not) assert
any claim or cause of action against any of the other party\'s direct or
indirect partners, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, Affiliates,
with respect thereto, or hold any such person liable with respect
thereto.   (d) Each of Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other, agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made
by the other party that are expressly set forth in the Transaction
Documents, Disclosure Letter and any other document, certificate, exhibit or
schedule delivered pursuant to the Transaction Documents, as applicable,
neither the other party nor any of its representatives or Affiliates has made
and shall not be deemed to have made to such party or to any of its
representatives or Affiliates any representation or warranty of any kind.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each      54 
59  party agrees that neither the other party nor any of its Affiliates
makes or has made any representation or warranty to such party or to any of
its representatives or Affiliates with respect to:   (i) any projections,
forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets  of future revenues, expenses or
expenditures, future results of  operations (or any component thereof),
future cash flows (or any  component thereof) or future financial condition
(or any  component thereof) of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries 
or the future business, operations or affairs of the other party  or any of
its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to  or made available to
such party or its counsel, accountants,  advisors, lenders, representatives
or Affiliates; and   (ii) any other information, statement or documents 
heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to such  party or its
counsel, accountants, advisors, lenders,  representatives or Affiliates with
respect to the other party or  any of its Subsidiaries or the business,
operations or affairs of  the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, except
to the extent  and as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made
by  the other party and contained in the Transaction Documents,  Company
Disclosure Letter and any other document, certificate,  exhibit or schedule
delivered pursuant to the Transaction  Documents.   (e) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after such time as Parent
Designees are appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to
Section 2.3 of this Agreement, any action or inaction approved by the
Company\'s Board of Directors that would otherwise cause a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement by
the Company for any reason whatsoever.   Section 9.3 Extension; Waiver.

withdrawn (but continuing to include for this purpose all Ordinary Shares
withdrawn at the instruction of Parent) and all Ordinary Shares issuable upon
conversion of Preferred Shares that are surrendered for conversion by the

exist:   (a) there shall be threatened, instituted or pending any  action
or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (i) challenging or  seeking to, or

Company and its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole or to compel Parent or
Purchaser to dispose of or hold  separately all or any material portion of
the business or assets of  Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or
the Company and its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or seeking to impose any
limitation on  the ability of Parent or Purchaser to conduct its business or
own such  assets, (iii) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of
Parent or  Purchaser effectively to exercise      66  ANNEX A  Page
2   full rights of ownership of the Shares, including, without limitation, 
the right to vote any Shares acquired or owned by Purchaser or Parent  on all
matters properly presented to the Company\'s shareholders, (iv)  seeking to
require divestiture by Parent or Purchaser of any Shares,  (v) seeking any
material diminution in the benefits expected to be  derived by Parent or
Purchaser as a result of the transactions  contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, or (vi) otherwise directly  or indirectly relating to any
Transaction and which could reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole or on
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken  as a whole;   (b) there shall be any
action taken, or any statute, rule,  regulation, legislation, interpretation,
judgment, order or injunction  proposed, enacted, enforced, promulgated,
amended or issued after the  date of this Agreement and applicable to or
deemed applicable to (i)  Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or (ii)  the Offer or the Scheme of Arrangement or any
Transaction, by any  Governmental Entity other than the routine application
of the waiting  period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer, any
Transaction or to  the Scheme of Arrangement, that could reasonably be
expected to result  directly or indirectly in any of the consequences
referred to in  paragraph (a) above;   (c) except for inaccuracies in any
representations or  warranties of the Company that result from actions or
inactions  required by the Acquisition Agreement, (i) any representation or 
warranty of the Company contained in the Acquisition Agreement that is 
qualified as to Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct  as
though made on or as of such date (other than representations and  warranties
which, by their terms, address matters only as of another  specified date,
which shall be true and correct only as of such other  specified date), and
(ii) any representation or warranties of the  Company contained in the
Acquisition Agreement that is not qualified as  to Material Adverse Effect
shall not be true and correct (except where  the failure of any such
representations or warranties referred to in  this clause (ii) to be so true
and correct in the aggregate has not  had, does not have, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company) as
of the date of consummation  of the Offer as though made on or as of such
date (other than  representations and warranties which, by their terms,
address matters  only as of another specified date, which shall be true and
correct only  as of such other specified date);   (d) the Company shall
have failed to perform in any material  respect any obligation or to comply
in any material respect with any  agreement or covenant of the Company to be
performed or complied with  by the Company under the Acquisition
Agreement;   (e) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee 
thereof shall (i) have withdrawn, modified or amended, or proposed to 
withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser,  the
approval, adoption or recommendation, as the case may be, of the  Offer, any
Transaction, the Scheme of Arrangement or the Acquisition  Agreement, or (ii)
shall have approved or recommended, or proposed to  approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) shall have  announced a neutral position with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal  and has not rejected such
Acquisition      2  67   ANNEX A  Page 3   Proposal within three
(3) Business Days of the announcement of such  neutral position, or (iv)
shall have resolved to do any of the  foregoing;   (f) the Acquisition
Agreement shall have been terminated in  accordance with its terms;  which,
in the sole judgment of Purchaser, in any such case and regardless of
the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or Purchaser)
giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the
Offer and/or with such acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Ordinary
Shares.   The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent
and Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser, or may be waived by
Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their respective sole discretion, except as otherwise provided in the
Acquisition Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.     3   '
