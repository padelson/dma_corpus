THE MERGER; CLOSING; RandW POLICY

 

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the provisions of the Texas Business Organizations
Code (the " _TBOC_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ ").
As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue its existence under the laws of the State of
Texas as the surviving corporation (in such capacity, the Company is referred
to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Parent shall own all of the stock and other equity, if
any, in Merger Sub and shall be the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and Merger
Sub shall be treated as a direct corporate subsidiary of the Parent for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes.

2.2 _Closing_. 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ "), shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Central time, on a date that is three Business Days following the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver in
accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in Article
IX (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waived in accordance with this Agreement
on the Closing Date) at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. in Houston,
Texas, or such other place as the Parent and the Company may agree in writing.
For purposes of this Agreement " _Closing Date_ " shall mean the date on which
the Closing occurs. 

(b) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date but after the Closing, (i) a
certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the TBOC (the " _Texas Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be filed
with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and (ii) a
certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the "Delaware _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be
filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective upon the acceptance of the filing of the Texas
Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State
of Texas and the acceptance of the filing of the Delaware Certificate of
Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such later time as shall be agreed upon in writing by the Parent and the
Company and specified in each of the Texas Certificate of Merger and the
Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
TBOC and the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities,

 



3  obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Parent shall own all of
the stock and other equity, if any, in the Surviving Corporation and shall be
the sole stockholder of the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation shall be treated as a direct corporate subsidiary of the Parent
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 

2.4 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be in the form of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement until such certificate of incorporation and bylaws are thereafter
amended and restated, subject to Section 8.12(a), in accordance with their
respective terms and applicable Law.

 

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties
shall take all necessary action such that from and after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, and
such directors and officers shall serve until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.6 _Post-Closing Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time, the
Parent shall cause the LLC Sub Merger, with LLC Sub continuing as the
surviving entity in such merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the
Parent, pursuant to a merger agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the " _LLC Sub Merger Agreement_ "). At the time of and
immediately after the LLC Sub Merger, the Parent shall own all of the
membership interests and other equity, if any, in LLC Sub and shall be the
sole member of LLC Sub, and LLC Sub shall be treated as an entity disregarded
as separate from the Parent for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

2.7 _R andW Policy_. On the Execution Date, the Parent has procured the RandW
Policy, and each of the Parent and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf
of the Stockholders) have paid to (a) the RandW Insurance Provider the
underwriting diligence fee and (b) the RandW Insurance Broker 10% of the
premium charged for the RandW Policy (the " _Premium Deposit_ ") and all surplus
lines taxes necessary to bind the RandW Policy (with each of the Parent, on the
one hand, and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders), on the other hand, paying one-half of such underwriting
diligence fee, Premium Deposit and surplus lines taxes). The RandW Policy is in
full force and effect as of the Execution Date, subject to receipt by the RandW
Insurance Provider of any subjectivities noticed in the RandW Policy binder.
Immediately prior to Closing, the Parent shall remit payment to the RandW
Insurance Broker for the balance of the premium owed on the RandW Policy (the "
_Premium Balance_ "), in accordance with the terms applicable to the RandW
Policy, and take whatever other action is necessary to ensure the
effectiveness of the RandW Policy at the Closing. An amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the Premium Balance shall be deducted from the Closing Date
Cash Merger Consideration, in lieu of the payment of such amount to the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) and the further
payment by the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) of
the Stockholders proportionate share of such Premium Balance.

 



4 ARTICLE III

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB

 

3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any Party:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, so that, after the Effective Time, the Parent shall be
the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving
Corporations common stock.

 

(b) Each holder (including, if applicable, any wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Parent (other than Merger Sub) or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company) of outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (excluding any Cancelled Shares) (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(excluding any Cancelled Shares) (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_ ") and
Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (excluding
any Cancelled Shares) (the " _Series B Preferred Stock_ " and, together with
the Series A Preferred Stock, the " _Company Preferred Stock_ ") immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall have its shares converted into the right to
receive (without interest) the number of shares of Specified Parent Common
Stock set forth opposite such Stockholders name on Section 3.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. All such shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled, extinguished and retired and shall cease to exist.
Each such Stockholder shall also be entitled to receive a portion of the
Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration payable to the Stockholders
Representative (for the account of and on behalf of the Stockholders) under
this Agreement, which portion shall be determined in accordance with that
certain Direction Letter, dated as of the Execution Date, among
the Stockholders Representative and the Stockholders (the " _Direction
Letter_ "). The Stockholders and the Stockholders Representative acknowledge

(a) _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, the Parent shall pay or cause to
be paid, or shall deposit or cause to be deposited, as the case may be, the

this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

 



6 (ii) The Parent shall issue or pay or cause to be issued or paid,
as applicable, to each holder of Company Shares that delivers a completed and
duly executed letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit

cancellation (or an affidavit of lost Certificate as contemplated by the
Letter of Transmittal) and a duly executed Lock-Up Agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (each, a " _Lock-Up Agreement_") with

Stock set forth opposite such holders name on Section 3.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule;

immediately available funds to the Stockholders Representative (for the
account of and on behalf of the Stockholders), the Closing Date Cash Merger
Consideration;

 

(iv) The Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the applicable lenders
identified in Section 4.1(a)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any
other holder of Closing Indebtedness, the applicable amounts in respect of the

in the applicable Payoff Letters; and

 

(v) The Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the applicable payees set
forth on Section 4.1(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any other

(b) _Post-Closing Payments_. From and after the Closing, the Parent shall
promptly (and in any event within five Business Days after receipt) pay or
cause to be paid to the Stockholders Representative for the account of and on
behalf of each Stockholder that delivers to the Parent at any time after the
Closing Date a completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and all
applicable Certificates for cancellation (or an affidavit of lost Certificate
as contemplated by the Letter of Transmittal) with respect to all Company
Shares held by such Stockholder, the consideration (without interest)
that would have been payable to such Stockholder pursuant to Sections
4.1(a)(ii) and (iii) if such Stockholder had delivered such documents on or
prior to the Closing Date. Any other payments (including distributions by the
Escrow Agent) to be made to the Stockholders Representative (for the account
of and on behalf of the Stockholders) following the Closing shall be made by
the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub or the Escrow Agent, as
applicable.

 

(c) _Unexchanged Company Shares_. The Parent will, promptly upon receipt
thereof, deliver to the Surviving Corporation or LLC Sub, as applicable,
surrendered Letters of Transmittal received by it, and, within five Business
Days after the 18th month following the Closing Date, return to the
Surviving Corporation or LLC Sub, as applicable, any portion of the
consideration remaining to be paid to the Stockholders Representative (for
the account of and on

 



7  behalf of the Stockholders) pursuant to this Article IV who have not yet
delivered their Letters of Transmittal and any other funds that are to be paid
to the Stockholders Representative (for the account of and on behalf of the
Stockholders). Any Stockholders shall thereafter be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation or LLC Sub, as applicable, for payment of their
claims for the consideration set forth in Section 3.1 without interest
thereon.

(d) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or
scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the delivery of a completed and duly executed Letter of

thereof to vote or to have any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Stockholder
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to such holder), such Stockholder shall receive, in lieu of such
fraction of a share, a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to
the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) $29.98.

(e) _No Liability for Abandoned Property_. Any other provision of this

(f) _Payments to Persons Other than Registered Holders_. If
any consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose

deliver such Certificate accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer.

the contrary, the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and LLC Sub
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, including from any shares of Specified
Parent Common Stock payable pursuant hereto, any amount required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Laws. If the applicable withholding agent determines that
deduction or withholding is required pursuant to this Section 4.1(g), it shall
give reasonable prior notice of any amount to be deducted or withheld to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding would be made. The
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, to minimize or eliminate to the
extent permissible under applicable Laws the amount of any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be paid to the applicable Governmental Body on behalf of the
Person from whom deducted or withheld and, to the extent so paid, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 



8 (h) _No Liability after Issuance of Specified Parent Common Stock
and Payments to Stockholders  Representative and Certain Other Payments_.

of the Specified Parent Common Stock to the Stockholders, the payment by the
Parent to the Stockholders Representative of the Final Cash Merger

Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or LLC Sub shall be liable to
any Stockholder for the portion of such amount (if any) payable by the
Stockholders Representative to such Stockholder hereunder, whether payable
to such Stockholder pursuant to the Direction Letter or otherwise, and each
Stockholder shall thereafter only be entitled to seek payment of such amount
from the Stockholders Representative.

 

4.2 _Other Deliveries and Actions at Closing_.

 

(a) At the Closing, the Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver, pay or issue,

provisions of this Agreement:

(i) to the Stockholders Representative, a duly executed counterpart to
each Lock-Up Agreement;

4.3 _Cash Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare and deliver, or shall cause to be prepared and delivered, to
the Parent a statement setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of (i)
the Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "); (ii)
the Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "); (iii)
the Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), calculated in
accordance with GAAP, except as otherwise set forth in the Working Capital
Calculation, including a calculation of the Estimated Working Capital Deficit
or the Estimated Working Capital Excess, as the case may be; (iv) the Closing
Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "); and (v) the Closing Date Cash Merger
Consideration resulting therefrom; _provided_ that, if the Parent indicates in
writing to the Company at least two Business Days prior to the Closing that it
does not agree with Companys calculation of the Estimated Working Capital or
the Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration, then the Parent and the Company
will use commercially reasonable efforts to mutually reconcile such dispute
and if any adjustments are made thereto, then the adjusted calculation of the
Estimated Working Capital and/or the Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration,
as so mutually reconciled, shall be the Estimated Working Capital and/or the
Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration; _provided, however_ , that if the
Parties cannot agree on the calculation of the Estimated Working Capital or
the Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration on or prior to the Business Day
prior to the Closing, then the Companys calculation of the Estimated Working
Capital and the Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration delivered pursuant to
this Section 4.3(a) shall be deemed the Estimated Working Capital and the
Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration for purposes of the Closing, except
that the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be increased by the aggregate
amount in dispute (the " _Disputed Estimated Closing Date Amount_ ");
_provided, however,_ that the Disputed Estimated Closing Date Amount shall not
exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

(b) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing, the Parent shall
prepare, or cause the LLC Sub to prepare and deliver to the Stockholders
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ "), which shall include (i) a calculation of the Closing
Indebtedness; (ii) a calculation of the Closing Transaction Expenses; (iii) a
calculation

 



10  of Working Capital, including a calculation of the Working Capital Deficit
or the Working Capital Excess, as the case may be; (iv) a calculation of the
Closing Cash; and (v) the Parents determination of the Final Cash Merger
Consideration resulting therefrom. The Stockholders Representative shall have
a period of 30 calendar days after delivery of the Closing Statement to review
such documents and make any objections in writing to the Parent (the "
_Stockholders  Representative Objection Notice_"); _provided_ that the
Stockholders Representative Objection Notice shall specify the amount of each
such objection along with a reasonable basis and supporting documentation to
substantiate each such objection. Any items not specifically objected to in
the Stockholders Representative Objection Notice will be deemed agreed upon
as set forth in the Closing Statement. For purposes of the Stockholders
Representatives evaluation of the Closing Statement, the Parent shall, and
shall cause the LLC Sub to make available or provide, upon advance notice and
during normal business hours, reasonable access to such information, books
and records and data as may be reasonably requested by the Stockholders
Representative to analyze the Closing Statement. If the Stockholders
Representative delivers a Stockholders Representative Objection Notice to
the Parent within such 30-day period, then the Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall attempt to resolve the matter or matters in dispute. If
no Stockholders Representative Objection Notice is delivered by the
Stockholders Representative within such 30-day period, then the Closing
Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties. If disputes with
respect to the Closing Statement cannot be resolved by the Parent and the
Stockholders Representative within 30 calendar days after timely delivery of
a Stockholders Representative Objection Notice, then, at the request of the
Parent or the Stockholders Representative, the specific items remaining in
dispute (but no others) shall be submitted to such independent accounting or
consulting firm as shall be mutually agreed to by the Stockholders
Representative and the Parent (the " _Auditors_ "), which firm shall render
its determination as to such specific items remaining in dispute. If the
Parent and the Stockholders Representative cannot agree on the selection of
independent accounting or consulting firm, the Parties shall request the
American Arbitration Association to appoint such independent accounting or
consulting firm, and such appointment shall be conclusive and binding on the
Parties. The matters to be resolved by the Auditors shall be limited to the
unresolved items remaining in dispute between the Parent and the Stockholders
Representative, and the Auditors shall make such determination based solely on
written submissions by the Parent and the Stockholders Representative, and
not by independent review. The Auditors shall promptly deliver to the Parent
and the Stockholders Representative a written report setting forth its
resolution of the disputes and the reasonable basis for each of its
determinations, along with its determination of the Final Cash Merger
Consideration, which shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
principles set forth in this Agreement and shall be final and binding on the
Parties. Prior to and until the delivery of the Auditors written report,
there shall be no ex parte communications between the Parties and the
Auditors. In resolving any disputed item, the Auditors (x) shall be bound by
the provisions of this Section 4.3(b) and (y) may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such items claimed by either the
Parent or the Stockholders Representative or less than the smallest value for
such items claimed by either the Parent or the Stockholders Representative.
The fees and expenses of the Auditors shall be borne in the same proportion
that the aggregate dollar amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted
to the Auditors that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Stockholders

 



11  Representative, on the one hand, and the Parent, on the other hand, as
finally determined by the Auditors, bears to the total dollar amount of such
remaining disputed items so submitted. By way of example only, if closing
accounts receivable is the only disputed item submitted to the Auditors, and
the Stockholders Representative claims that closing accounts receivable is
$1,000, and the Parent contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the
Stockholders Representative and if the Auditors ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding the Stockholders Representative $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Auditors will be allocated 60%
(i.e., 300 / 500) to the Parent and 40% (i.e., 200 / 500) to the
Stockholders Representative. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing Date
Cash Merger Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.3(b) shall be
the " _Final Cash Merger Consideration_ " for the purposes of this Agreement.

(c) If the Final Cash Merger Consideration exceeds the Closing Date Cash
Merger Consideration, then (i) within two Business Days following the final
determination thereof, the Parent shall pay the amount of the excess by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Stockholders Representative
for the account of and on behalf of the Stockholders, which amount shall be
disbursed to the Stockholders in accordance with the Direction Letter;
provided, that such disbursements to the Stockholders shall be (x) made only
to each Stockholder that has delivered a completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal to the Parent, and all applicable Certificates for cancellation
(or an affidavit of lost Certificate as contemplated by the Letter of
Transmittal) with respect to all Company Shares held by such Stockholder; and
(y) subject to Section 4.1(b); and (ii) the Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release all of the Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount (and all interest earned thereon) to the Stockholders Representative
for the account of and on behalf of the Stockholders, which amount shall be
disbursed to the Stockholders in accordance with the Direction Letter;
provided, that such disbursements to the Stockholders shall be (x) made only
to each Stockholder that has delivered a completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal to the Parent, and all applicable Certificates for cancellation
(or an affidavit of lost Certificate as contemplated by the Letter of
Transmittal) with respect to all Company Shares held by such Stockholder; and
(y) subject to Section 4.1(b).

 

(d) If the Closing Date Cash Merger Consideration is greater than the Final
Cash Merger Consideration (such excess, the " _Parent Merger Consideration
Disbursement_ ") and the Parent Merger Consideration Disbursement (i) is less
than the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release (A) an amount equal to the Parent
Merger Consideration Disbursement from the Escrow Account to the Parent and
(B) the remainder of the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount (and any interest
thereon) to the Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the
Stockholders, which remainder shall be disbursed to the Stockholders in
accordance with the Direction Letter; provided, that such disbursements to
the Stockholders shall be (x) made only to each Stockholder that has delivered
a completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal to the Parent, and all
applicable Certificates for cancellation (or an affidavit of lost Certificate
as contemplated by the Letter of Transmittal) with respect to all Company
Shares held by such Stockholder; and (y) subject to Section 4.1(b);

 



12  or (ii) (A) is equal to or (B) exceeds the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount
(such excess, the " _Parent Escrow Disbursement_ ), the Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release all of the Closing
Adjustment Escrow Amount (and any interest thereon) to the Parent, and in the
case of clause (ii)(B), but subject to the Parents right set forth in the
proviso below, the Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall deliver a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release to the Parent an amount equal to the Parent Escrow Disbursement (and
any interest thereon) from the Escrow Account, _provided, however_ , that the
Parent (in its sole discretion) may instead require the Stockholders to pay
the Parent Escrow Disbursement (in accordance with their respective
percentages set forth on Section 4.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) in
immediately available funds to the Parent, and the Parent shall have no
obligation to cause the release of funds from the Escrow Account (other than
the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount) in respect thereof.

matters referred to in Section 6.4, contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation of any of the terms or requirements of, or give any Governmental
Body the right to revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel, terminate, or modify,
any Permit that is held by the Parent or Merger Sub, or that otherwise relates

filing) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under

Execution Date, no executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect to
make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As of the Execution Date, there are no material

disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and

reasonably designed to ensure that (i) all information required to be
disclosed by the Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and (ii) all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Parents management, including its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

(e) The Parent and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)

reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP.

 



37 (f) Since the Applicable Date, (i) there have not been any changes in the
Parents internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely
to materially affect the Parents and its Subsidiaries internal controls over
financial reporting; (ii) the Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Parents outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Parents board of directors any
"significant deficiency" or "material weakness" in the design or operation of
the Parents internal controls over financial reporting, which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Parents and
its Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
information; and (iii) none of the Parent, the Parents outside auditors or
the audit committee of the Parent Board has received any oral or
written notification of any Fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of the Parent who have a significant role in the
Parents internal controls over financial reporting. The terms "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the meanings assigned to such
terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.

books and records of the Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis,
was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in such financial statements
or the notes thereto), and fairly presents in all material respects the
financial condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders
equity, and cash flow of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, as of the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such
financial statements (taking into account the notes thereto), subject, in the
case of interim financial statements, to (i) the omission of notes to the
extent permitted by Regulation S-X and (ii) normal, recurring year-end
adjustments.

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC)), and including similar
collaboration, participation or off-set arrangements or obligations, where the
result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries in the Parent SEC Reports or the Parents financial
statements, or (ii) any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship

nor the Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement or disclosure regarding the
Transaction Documents or the Transactions without the prior approval of the
other Party; _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt, such other Party for
purposes of this Section 8.8 is the (a) Parent, in the case of the Company,
the Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates and (b) Stockholders
Representative, in the case of the Parent or any of its Affiliates (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), except
as may be required by applicable Law or

 



47  by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, in which case the Party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public statement or disclosure shall first, to the
extent practicable, consult with the other Party about, and allow the other
Party reasonable time to comment in advance on, such press release, public
announcement, or disclosure; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 8.8 shall (i) limit or restrict the Parent or any of its Affiliates
from making any public statements or presentations in connection with industry
conferences, investor meetings, analyst meetings, analyst or
investor conference calls, or in response to questions from investors,
analysts, press or other media and in each case, that does not involve the
disclosure of competitively sensitive information; (ii) limit or prohibit any
private equity fund associated with the Company from disclosing the financial
terms and conditions, or any other terms and conditions, of this Agreement and
the Transactions to its limited partners and Affiliates; or (iii) limit or
prohibit any Party from making any press release, public announcement or
other public disclosure concerning the Transaction Documents or Transactions
following a disclosure that is otherwise permitted in accordance with this
Section 8.8, except that any such disclosure under this clause (iii) shall
not contain information that was not previously publicly disclosed pursuant to
this Section 8.8. __

 

8.9 _Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement_.

 

(a) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, each
of the Stockholders hereby agrees that it will not, and that it will cause
its Affiliates, stockholders, partners, managers, members, directors,
officers, agents and representatives not to, at any time after the Execution
Date, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the
Parent, disclose or use any confidential or proprietary information of,
involving or relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (" _Confidential
Information_ "), other than in the performance of such Persons duties as an
employee or agent of, or otherwise on behalf of, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, the Parent or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the information subject to the foregoing provision of this
sentence will not include any information generally available to, or known
by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof) or
that was independently developed by such Stockholder or such Stockholders
Affiliates, stockholders, partners, managers, members, directors, officers,
agents and representatives without use or reference to Confidential
Information or was in its rightful possession before the disclosure of the
applicable Confidential Information to it; and _provided_ , _ further_ , that
the provisions of this Section 8.9 will not prohibit any retention of copies
of records or disclosure (i) required by applicable Law so long as, to the
extent practicable, reasonable prior notice is given to the Parent of such
disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded to contest the same or
(ii) reasonably necessary and made in connection with the enforcement of any
right or remedy relating to this Agreement.

 

(b) As a material inducement for the Parent to enter into this Agreement,
and in order to protect the Confidential Information and the goodwill that is
conveyed by the Stockholders hereunder, each Stockholder agrees to the
restrictions set forth in this Section 8.9. Subject to the limitations set
forth in the last two sentences of this Section 8.9(b), each Stockholder
agrees that, during the Restricted Period (and, for Leffler, for the period
that begins

 



48  on the Closing Date and ends on the date that is five years after the
Closing Date), such Stockholder shall not, and such Stockholder shall cause
such Stockholders Affiliates to not, directly or indirectly: (i) within the
Restricted Area, solicit, approach or entice away or cause to be solicited,
approached or enticed away from the Parent or any of its Affiliates any Person
who or which is a customer with respect to the Business conducted by (or that
was conducted prior to the Closing Date by) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (ii) engage or employ, or solicit or contact with a view to
the engagement or employment of, any Employee or any other Person who is an
officer, director, employee or contractor of the Parent or any of its
Affiliates and who performs services with respect to the Business conducted by
(or that was conducted prior to the Closing Date by) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.9(b) shall
not prevent (A) portfolio companies of White Deer Energy L.P., White Deer
Energy L.P. II, SCIP Limited Partnership OTH, L.P. or Sierra Nevada (Bermuda)
L.P. (such named entities, collectively, the " _White Deer and Silverfern
Funds_ "), or any of the respective Affiliates of the White Deer and
Silverfern Funds, from engaging in solicitation of customers or employees of
the Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) in
the ordinary course of business, so long as such solicitation was not directly
or indirectly initiated or encouraged by any Stockholder (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the White Deer and Silverfern Funds); or (B) Leffler from
(1) engaging in solicitation of customers of the Parent or its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) in connection with any business
other than the Business, or (2) employing or otherwise engaging, in
connection with any business other than the Business, any Employee or other
Person who is an officer, employee or contractor of the Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), whom Leffler has
not, directly or indirectly, initiated or encouraged the solicitation,
employment or engagement of such Person or whose employment or engagement by
Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company or its Subsidiaries) has
terminated, so long as such termination was not directly or indirectly
encouraged by Leffler. In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Ben
A. Guill, James K. Meneely III and Sandy Vaughan may serve as shareholders,
members, partners, officers, directors and/or managers of White Deer Energy
L.P., White Deer Energy L.P. II and/or their respective portfolio companies,
and such Stockholders shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Section
8.9(b) by virtue of such roles alone, so long as no such Stockholder directly
or indirectly initiates or encourages the solicitation of any customers or
employees of the Parent or its Affiliates.

 

(c) Leffler covenants and agrees that, until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Leffler shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or
assist others in engaging in the Business within the Restricted Area or (ii)
have a direct or indirect interest in any Person that engages, directly or
indirectly, in the Business in the Restricted Area in any capacity, including
as a partner, shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent, advisor,
trustee or consultant; _provided_ that the foregoing restrictions shall not
prohibit Leffler from (A) engaging in the Business on behalf of Parent or its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (B) owning,
directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person
traded on any national securities exchange if Leffler is not a controlling
Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not,
directly or indirectly, own five percent (5%) or more of any class of
securities of such Person.

 



49 (d) Each Stockholder covenants and agrees that, during the
Restricted Period, neither such Stockholder nor any of its representatives or
agents, shall make any public statement, or cause any public statement to be
made or attributed to such Stockholder or any of its representatives or
agents, that disparages, calls into disrepute, defames or slanders the
Parent, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
any of the foregoing entities respective successors, predecessors, officers,
directors, managers, members, employees, stockholders, agents, attorneys,
representatives, businesses, products or services.

(e) Each Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the geographic scope,
scope of activity restrictions, and duration of the covenants contained in
this Section 8.9 are the result of arms-length bargaining and are fair and
reasonable in light of (i) such Stockholders level of control over and
contact with the Companys and its Subsidiaries business, and association
with the Companys and its Subsidiaries goodwill in all jurisdictions in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business; and (ii) the
consideration that such Stockholder is receiving in connection with the
Transactions, and the goodwill that such Stockholder is conveying and for
which the Parent is paying. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that
the provisions of this Section 8.9 (and portions thereof) be enforced to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Stockholders acknowledge that
this Section 8.9 is reasonable and enforceable in all respects; nonetheless,
if any of the restrictions of this Section 8.9 (or portions thereof) are found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, overly broad, or
otherwise unenforceable, the Parties intend that such restrictions (and
portions thereof) shall not be thereby terminated but shall be modified by
such court so as to be valid and enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully
enforced.

 

(f) Each Party further acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of
this Section 8.9 would cause irreparable harm to the Parent for which it
would have no adequate remedy at Law, that it would be impractical and
extremely difficult to determine the Parents and its Affiliates damages in
the event of a breach or threatened breach, and that the Parent and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and specific
performance as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be the
exclusive remedies for a breach or threatened breach of this Section 8.9
but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law and equity,
including the recovery of damages.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will prevent
any individual from: (i) lawfully initiating communications directly with,
cooperating with, providing information to, causing information to be provided
to, or otherwise assisting in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other Governmental Body regarding a possible
violation of any law; (ii) responding to any inquiry or legal process directed
to an individual from any Governmental Body; (iii) testifying, participating
or otherwise assisting in an action or proceeding by any Governmental Body
relating to a possible violation of law, including providing documents or
other confidential information to Governmental Bodies; or (iv) receiving an
award for information provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
or another Governmental Body. No individual will be required to obtain prior
authorization from the Parent or any of its Affiliates before engaging in any
of the conduct described in the previous 

 



50  sentence, or to notify the Parent or any of its Affiliates of having engaged
in any such conduct. Further, (A) no individual shall be held criminally or
civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure
of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state, or local
government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or
investigating a suspected violation of law; and (B) no individual will be
held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law
for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in a complaint or other
document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided such filing is made
under seal.

8.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, commencing on the Closing Date and
continuing through the date that is twelve months following the Closing Date,
the Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Employee
compensation and employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to either (i) the material compensation and employee benefits
provided to such Employee by the Company on the date of this Agreement, or
(ii) the material compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of the Parent or its Affiliate that then employs such
Employee during such period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent shall
have no obligation to provide equity grants to the Employees. As of the
Closing Date, the Company shall have made or caused to be made any and all
arrangements necessary to continue in full force and effect the payroll and
health and welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to allow
continued participation of the Employees therein, until such time as the
Employees commence participation in the health and welfare benefit plans of
the Parent (the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") and are transferred to the
Parents payroll, in accordance with this Section 8.10(a). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event an industry downturn or other economic circumstances
negatively impact the Company and its Subsidiaries, the compensation and
employee benefits provided under clause (i) or (ii) above may be reduced as
part of a generally applicable reduction in salary or other compensation or
benefits that applies in the same manner to other similarly situated employees
of the Parent or its Subsidiaries or its Affiliate that then employs such
Employee during such period.

 

(b) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plans in which any Employee will
participate following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, or to cause
any third party insurance carriers to, (i) waive all limitations as to pre-
existing condition exclusions, active employment requirements, requirements
to show evidence of good health and waiting periods with respect to Employees
and their spouses and dependents, if applicable, to the same extent waived
under a similar or comparable Benefit Program in which such Employee
participated immediately before the Closing Date and (ii) cause each Parent
Benefit Plan to provide each Employee with credit for any co-payments or
deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductible
requirements or out of pocket limits under the Parent Benefit Plans for the
plan year in which participation in such Parent Benefit Plan occurs.

 



51 (c) The Parent shall cause to be provided to each Employee credit
for prior service with the Company or its Affiliates to the extent such
service would be recognized if it had been performed as an employee of the
Parent or its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting in each vacation, severance, retirement, welfare benefit and paid-
time off plan or program of the Parent, if any, in which such Employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date to the same extent as such
Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service
under the corresponding Benefit Program, if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) The Company shall continue in full force and effect, until the
Effective Time, (i) the fidelity bond, if any, issued to the Company as
described in ERISA Section 412; and (ii) the ERISA fiduciary liability
insurance policy currently in effect, if any, for the benefit of the covered
fiduciaries of the O-Tex Pumping 401(k) Plan.

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that no provision of this Agreement
shall be construed to: (i) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (ii) create any right to any compensation or benefits
whatsoever on the part of any Employee or other future, present or former
employee of the Company, its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates, the Parent, or its
Affiliates; (iii) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude
the ability of the Parent to terminate any employee, independent contractor
or Employee for any reason at any time; (iv) require the Parent to continue
any Parent Benefit Plan or Benefit Program, or other employee compensation or
benefit plans or arrangements, or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Closing Date; or (v) constitute an amendment to
any Benefit Program, Parent Benefit Plan, or other employee benefit or
compensation plan or arrangement.

 

8.11 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Stockholders and the
Company shall not, and shall not permit their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
representatives or agents (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly
or indirectly, (i) discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate,
authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as the proposed surviving,
merged, acquiring or acquired corporation, any business combination
transaction, whether by way of merger, consolidation, business
combination, purchase or disposition of any amount of the assets or equity
interests of the Company or otherwise, other than the Transactions (an "
_Acquisition Transaction_ "), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate
discussions, negotiations or submissions of written offers, inquiries,
proposals or indications of interest (other than an offer, inquiry, proposal
or indication of interest by the Parent) contemplating or relating to any
Acquisition Transaction (each an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (iii) furnish
or cause to be furnished, to any Person, any information concerning the
business, operations, properties or assets of the Company in connection with
or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of
interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) approve, endorse, or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into
any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction or (vi) otherwise cooperate
in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any
effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing.

 



52 (b) Commencing on the Execution Date, each Stockholder shall, and
shall cause the Company and their Affiliates and Representatives to, (i)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than the Parent) conducted heretofore
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) notify the Parent orally and in
writing promptly (but in no event later than one Business Day) after receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or for access to the properties, books or records of
the Company by any Person other than the Parent (such notice shall indicate
the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, or intending to
make an Acquisition Proposal or offer or requesting non-public information
relating to the Company or access to the properties, books or records of the
Company, the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal, or modification or
amendment to such Acquisition Proposal and shall include copies of any written
Acquisition Proposal or amendments or supplements thereto, and the Company
shall keep the Parent informed, on a current basis, of any material changes
in the status and any material changes or modifications in the material terms
of any such Acquisition Proposal), (iii) to the extent not previously
requested, request the return or destruction of any confidential written or
electronic materials provided to any Person in connection with a contemplated
or potential Acquisition Proposal and (iv) and immediately prohibit any access
by any Person (other than the Parent and its representatives) to any physical
or electronic data room relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill," or similar agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and will enforce or cause to be enforced
each such agreement at the request of the Parent.

8.12 _Charter Provisions Regarding Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the
current or former managers, directors, officers, members, employees, agents
and fiduciaries of the Company (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ ")
as provided as of the Execution Date in the Organizational Documents of the
Company shall survive the Transactions and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six years
from the Closing Date. The Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Company after the Closing) not to, repeal such arrangements in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Company Indemnitees
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Indemnitees shall not
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.12 in connection
with (i) any matter as to which any Parent Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Article XI or (ii) any action, claim or dispute
between or among the Stockholders or the holders of Company Options.

 



53 (b) In the event the Parent or the Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent or the Company or such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or
such transferee, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 8.12.

(c) The obligations of the Parent under this Section 8.12 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnitee to whom this Section 8.12 applies without the consent of such
Company Indemnitee so adversely affected.

 

8.13 _D andO Tail Policy_. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company or the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) will cause to be
put in place, and shall fully prepay immediately prior to, and conditioned
upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, an extended reporting period
endorsement under their existing directors and officers liability insurance
coverage for their directors and officers, which will provide such directors
and officers with coverage for six years following the Closing Date of not
less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially
less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company or the
Stockholders (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"). An amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the premium for the DandO Policy shall be added to the Closing Date
Cash Merger Consideration.

 

8.14 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Stockholders Representative will prepare or cause to be prepared
each Tax Return of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Taxable Period that is required to be filed after the Closing Date. Each such
Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except
to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. As provided in Section
8.14(h), the Parent shall include the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
Parents U.S. federal consolidated income Tax Return for the period beginning
the day after the Closing Date, which will effectively require the Company
and its Subsidiaries to file a separate U.S. federal income Tax Return for the
short stub period from January 1, 2017 through the Closing Date. Reasonably in
advance of the due date, including extensions, for filing any Tax Return
under this Section 8.14(a) (other than Tax Returns relating to sales, use,
payroll or other taxes that are required to be filed contemporaneously with,
or promptly after, the close of a taxable period, in each case a copy of
which shall be provided to the Parent by the Stockholders Representative upon
the Parents written request), the Stockholders Representative will deliver a
copy of each Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and
workpapers, to the Parent for its review and reasonable comment. The Parent
will provide any reasonable comments to the Stockholders Representative
within 15 days after the receipt of such Tax Return. The
Stockholders Representative shall incorporate or cause to be incorporated
any such comments subject to the Stockholders Representatives approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
The Stag Leap Representative shall provide

 



54  such final Tax Returns to Parent for execution and filing and Parent shall
cause each such Tax Return to be filed timely and payment of Taxes to be
timely paid with the appropriate Governmental Body and will provide a copy
thereof to the Stockholders Representative. Not later than five days prior to
the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to each Tax Return for a
Pre-Closing Taxable Period, the Stockholders Representative shall pay to (or
at the direction of) the Parent the amount of any Company Taxes with respect
to such Tax Return.

 

(b) The Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or
cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for all Straddle Periods. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of the due date, including extensions,
for filing any such Tax Return (other than Tax Returns relating to sales, use,
payroll or other taxes that are required to be filed contemporaneously with,
or promptly after, the close of a taxable period, in each case a copy of
which shall be provided to the Stockholders Representative by the Parent
upon the Stockholders Representatives written request), the Parent will
deliver a copy of each Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation
and workpapers, to the Stockholders Representative for its review and
reasonable comment. The Stockholders Representative will provide any
reasonable comments to the Parent within 15 days after the receipt of such Tax
Return. The Parent shall incorporate or cause to be incorporated any such
comments subject to the Parents approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). The Parent shall cause each
such Tax Return to be filed timely and payment of Taxes to be timely paid
with the appropriate Governmental Body and will provide a copy thereof to the
Parent. Not later than five days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes with respect to each Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the
Stockholders Representative shall pay to (or at the direction of) the Parent
the amount of any Company Taxes with respect to such Tax Return.

 

(c) For any U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. Tax purposes, Taxes
that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date in the following manner. For allocations of income or deductions
required to determine any income Taxes, sales and use Taxes, payroll Taxes or
other transactional Taxes for a Straddle Period, such allocation shall be made
by means of a closing of the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of all Taxes other than
income Taxes, sales and use Taxes, payroll Taxes or other transactional Taxes
in respect of the Straddle Period shall be allocated between the period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the period beginning after the
Closing Date based on the number of days for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the
number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date, on the other hand. For purposes of this paragraph, exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the
deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a daily basis. Any
franchise Tax or other Tax providing the right to do business for a specified
period shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income,
operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured,
regardless of whether the right to do business for another period is obtained
by the payment of such Tax.

 



55 (d) The Stockholders, the Parent, the Company and each of their
respective Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in contesting or defending
against any audit, litigation or other claim for Taxes (each, a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or
activities of the Company or any Subsidiary relating to any Pre-Closing
Taxable Period or any Straddle Period. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and, upon the request of the Party or Parties preparing the Tax
Return or controlling the Tax Proceeding, the provision to such Party or
Parties of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax
Return or Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any
material provided hereunder. All out-of-pocket expenses related to
such cooperation shall be borne by the Party requesting such cooperation.
Notwithstanding the above, the control and conduct of any Tax Proceeding that
is a third-party Indemnification Claim shall be governed by Article XI. Any
information obtained by a Party or its Affiliates from another Party or its
Affiliates in connection with any Tax matters to which this Agreement applies
shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit
or other proceeding, or as may otherwise be necessary to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(e) Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Integrated Mergers, taken together, to qualify, and will not take
or knowingly fail to take (and will cause its Subsidiaries not to take or
knowingly fail to take and use its reasonable best efforts to prevent any
other Affiliate of such Party from taking or knowingly failing to take) any
action that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Integrated Mergers,
taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(f) Any refunds of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than any refund resulting from the carryback of a net operating loss or other
Tax attribute from a period beginning after the Closing Date to a period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, which refund shall be for the account
of the Parent) (whether in the form of cash received or a credit or offset
actually realized against Taxes otherwise payable) (" _Tax Refunds_ ") for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the Stockholders. Any Tax
Refunds for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the
account of the Parent. Any Tax Refunds for any Straddle Period shall be
equitably apportioned between the Stockholders and the Parent in accordance
with the principles provided for in Section 8.14(c). To the extent that the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries receives a Tax Refund that is for the
account of the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 8.14(f), the Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid the amount of such Tax Refund (and any interest
received from the Governmental Body), net any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
or expenses incurred by the Parent or its Affiliates in procuring such
refund, to the Stockholders. To the extent that any Stockholder receives a Tax
Refund that is for the account of the Parent pursuant to this Section 8.14(f),
such Stockholder shall pay the amount of such Tax Refund (and any
interest received from the Governmental Body), net any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs or

 



56  expenses incurred by such Stockholder or its Affiliates in procuring such
refund, to the Parent. The amount due to the Stockholders or the Parent, as
applicable, under this Section 8.14(f) shall be paid to the Stockholders or
the Parent, as applicable, within 30 days of the receipt of the Tax Refund
from the applicable Governmental Body (or, if the Tax Refund is in the form of
a credit or offset against Taxes otherwise payable, within 30 days after the
due date of the Tax Return claiming such credit or offset).

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any Tax deductions attributable
to or arising from the Transaction Expenses, including payments in
cancellation of Company Options, shall, with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, be deducted in the Pre-Closing Taxable Period or, with respect
to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date.

 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, no election shall be made under Sections
338 or 336(e) with respect to the acquisition of the Company Shares.
Furthermore, neither the Parent nor its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) will make any other election after the Closing Date
(including any elective entity classification election under
Treasury Regulation § 301.7701-3) with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries that would have effect prior to the Closing Date and that would
materially increase the amount of Company Taxes. Notwithstanding the above,
the Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) may
make an election described in the previous sentence provided that any
additional Taxes resulting therefrom will not be deemed to constitute Company
Taxes. Consistent with Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-76, the Parent has agreed to and
shall include the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Parents U.S. federal
consolidated income Tax Return for the period beginning the day after the
Closing Date.

8.15 _Interim Financial Statements_.

 

(a) From the Execution Date to the Closing, the Company will make
available to the Parent, within 25 days of the end of the applicable monthly
accounting period for the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding Raptor),
monthly unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding Raptor), on a consolidated
basis, for each such monthly accounting period and, within 45 days after the
end of the quarterly accounting period for any fiscal quarter of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (excluding Raptor) occurring after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing, quarterly unaudited consolidated balance sheets and
related statements of income of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding
Raptor), on a consolidated basis, for such quarterly accounting periods. Such
financial statements will fairly present in all material respects the
financial position and operating results, equity and income of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (excluding Raptor) as of, and for the periods ended on, the
respective dates thereof.

 

(b) Commencing on the Execution Date, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and its and their officers and employees, to use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare (i) an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its

 



57  Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2017 and (ii) unaudited consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2017 and 2016 (collectively, the " _Interim Financial Statements_ "), and
to cause such Interim Financial Statements to be delivered to the Company as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the 40th calendar day
following the Closing Date.

(c) From the Execution Date until the Closing, upon written request by the
Parent, the Company shall request Grant Thornton, after discussing
specifications with the Parent, to (i) provide a review of the Interim
Financial Statements in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards 100
(Interim Financial Information), (ii) provide its written consent for the use
of its audit reports with respect to the Audited Financial Statements in any
registration statement filed with the SEC under the Securities Act or current
or periodic report filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act (an " _SEC
Filing_ "), in each case to the extent the foregoing are to be filed with the
SEC by the Parent, its Affiliates or their respective successors and assigns,
and (iii) conduct such other procedures as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate for Grant Thornton to provide the foregoing. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their officers and employees to,
reasonably cooperate with Grant Thornton in the completion of a review and the
Interim Financial Statements, including, if requested by Grant Thornton, the
execution and delivery to Grant Thornton of representation letters, in form
and substance customary for representation letters provided to external audit
firms by management of the company whose financial statements are the subject
of a review pursuant to Statement of Auditing Standards 100 (Interim Financial
Information), as may be reasonably requested by Grant Thornton, with respect
to the Interim Financial Statements. To the extent required by the Grant
Thornton, the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
officers and employees to, provide such reasonable further cooperation,
including by providing such additional management letters of representation,
as may be reasonably requested by Grant Thornton, in order for Grant Thornton
to provide any further written consents to the inclusion or incorporation by
reference of the Audited Financial Statements in any future SEC Filings of
Parent, its Affiliates, or their respective successors and assigns or provide
auditor comfort letters to underwriters and initial purchasers
customarily furnished in connection with the offering of any equity or debt
securities by Parent, its Affiliates or their respective successors and
assigns.

 

(d) All reasonable and documented costs and expenses of Grant Thornton and
any other third parties (including, without limitation, Penlight Consulting,
LLC, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Tax Group Partners) incurred in connection
with clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 8.15 shall be borne by Parent.

 

8.16 _Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file a resale
registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act with the
SEC registering the resale of the Specified Parent Common Stock (the " _Resale
Shelf_ ") within 30 days of the Closing Date, (ii) have the Resale Shelf
declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing
and (iii) maintain the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf for a period of three
years following the date such Resale Shelf was declared effective by the SEC
(the " _Required Effective Period_ ").

 



58 (b) Notwithstanding Section 8.16(a):

 

(i) The Parent shall not be required to file the Resale Shelf (or any
amendment thereto) or, if the Resale Shelf has been filed but not declared
effective by the SEC, request effectiveness of such Resale Shelf, or, if such
Resale Shelf has been declared effective by the SEC, may suspend the use of
any prospectus that is part of the Resale Shelf, for up to 90 calendar days
from the date of the Suspension Notice (as defined below), by providing
written notice to the Holders if the Parent shall have furnished to such
Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer (or other
authorized officer) of the Parent stating that the Parents Board of
Directors has determined in its reasonable good faith judgment that the filing
of the Resale Shelf (or any amendment thereto) or the request for
effectiveness of such Resale Shelf should be delayed or the offer or sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Shelf should be suspended (as
applicable); _provided_ that the Parent may not invoke a delay or suspension
pursuant to this Section 8.16(b)(i) for more than 90 calendar days in the
aggregate in any 12 month period. The Parent may invoke this Section
8.16(b)(i) only if the Parents Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its advisors or legal counsel, that the filing of the
Resale Shelf (or any amendment thereto), the request for effectiveness of such
Resale Shelf or offer or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale
Shelf (as applicable) would reasonably be expected to: (i) have a Material
Adverse Effect on any proposal or plan by the Parent or any of its
subsidiaries to engage in any material acquisition of assets or stock (other
than in the ordinary course of business) or any material merger,
consolidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization or other
transaction involving the Parent or any of its subsidiaries; or (ii) require
premature disclosure of material non-public information (" _MNPI_ ") that the
Parent has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential;
_provided_ that a Suspension Event (as defined below) shall automatically
expire upon the public disclosure of the information to which the MNPI
relates.

(ii) In the case of an event that causes the Parent to delay the filing or
effectiveness of the Resale Shelf, or suspend the use of any prospectus that
is part of the Resale Shelf, as set forth in Section 8.16(b)(i) (a "
_Suspension Event_ "), the Parent shall give a notice to the Holders (a "
_Suspension Notice_ ") of such delay or suspension and such notice shall state
that such delay or suspension shall continue only for so long as the
Suspension Event or its effect is continuing. The Parent shall not include
any MNPI in the Suspension Notice or otherwise provide such information to
Holders unless specifically requested in writing. No Holder shall sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale Shelf at any time after it has
received a Suspension Notice from the Parent and prior to receipt of an End
of Suspension Notice. Holders may recommence sales pursuant to the Resale
Shelf following further written notice to such effect (an " _End of Suspension
Notice_ ") from the Parent, and such End of Suspension Notice shall be given
by the Parent to the Holders promptly following the conclusion of any
Suspension Event.

 



59 (iii) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the
Parent gives a Suspension Notice with respect to the Resale Shelf, the Parent
agrees that it shall:

(A) extend the Required Effective Period, which such Resale Shelf shall be
maintained effective pursuant to Section 8.16(a) by the number of days during
the period from the date of receipt by the selling Holders named in the Resale
Shelf of the Suspension Notice to and including the date of receipt by the
selling Holders of the End of Suspension Notice;

(B) as promptly as practicable after selling Holders receipt of an End
of Suspension Notice, prepare a post-effective amendment or supplement to the
registration statement or the prospectus or any document incorporated therein
by reference, or file any required document so that, as thereafter delivered
to purchasers of the Registrable Shares included therein, the prospectus will
not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and

(C) provide copies of any supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to
resume sales, with respect to each Suspension Event;

_provided_ that such period of time shall not be extended beyond the date
that there are no longer Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement.

 

(c) For purposes of this Section 8.16:

 

(i) " _Holder_ " means any party that beneficially owns Registrable
Securities.

 

(ii) " _Registrable Securities_ " means at any time Specified Parent Common
Stock held or beneficially owned by any Holder; _provided, however,_ that as
to any Registrable Securities, such securities shall irrevocably cease to
constitute Registrable Securities upon the earliest to occur of:

 

(A) the date on which such securities have been disposed of pursuant to the
Resale Shelf;

 

(B) the date on which such securities have been disposed of pursuant to
Rule 144;

 

(C) the date on which such securities cease to be outstanding; and

 

(D) the end of the Required Effective Period, as the same may be extended
pursuant to Section 8.16(b)(iii).

 



60 8.17 _Listing_. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the listing (subject to official notice of issuance) of the Specified
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE.

 

8.18 _Stockholder Waiver of Notice_. All Stockholders who hold Series A
Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock (as such terms are defined in
the Restated Certificate of Formation with New Amendments of the Company,
which was filed with the Texas Secretary of State on June 2, 2016 (the "
_Restated Certificate_ ")) hereby waive, with respect to the Transactions,
(a) their right under Section 4(d) of the Restated Certificate to receive (i)
written notice of any Liquidation (as such term is defined in the Restated
Certificate) in accordance with the notice provisions in the Amended and
Restated Stockholders Agreement of the Company, dated effective as of
September 7, 2012, and (ii) a certificate prepared by an officer of the
Company describing the facts of such Liquidation and the aggregate Series A
Liquidation Value or Series B Liquidation Value (as such terms are defined in
the Restated Certificate), as applicable, in each case at least 10 days prior
to such Liquidation, and (b) any similar or other notice rights, if any, set
forth in the TBOC or the DGCL.

decree or judgment prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions;

 

(c) By either the Parent or the Company in the event that the Closing has
not occurred on or prior to December 31, 2017 (the " _Termination Date_ ");

Authority has made a request for additional information or documentary
material relevant to the Transactions after the initial filing, the
Termination Date shall be

 



63  automatically extended until February 28, 2018; _provided, further,
however,_ that (i) the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(c) if such failure of the Closing to occur is due to the
failure of the Company, the Stockholders Representative or any Stockholder to
perform and comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements
to be performed or complied with by the Company, the Stockholders
Representative or such Stockholder, as applicable, and (ii) the Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c) if such failure of
the Closing to occur is due to the failure of the Parent to perform and
comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements to be
performed or complied with by the Parent; or

 

(d) By either the Parent or the Company if there shall have been a breach
or inaccuracy of the other Partys representations and warranties in this

Agreement (which, in the case of the right of termination (i) by the Company,
shall also include any breach by Merger Sub and (ii) by the Parent, shall
also include any breach by the Stockholders Representative or any

such failure is reasonably capable of being cured by the Termination Date, in
which case, so long as the breaching Party is using commercially reasonable

no event beyond the Termination Date) after receipt of notice from the
terminating party of its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(d) to cure such failure before the terminating Party may so
terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , no Party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d) if (i) any of such Partys

applicable, not to be satisfied or (ii) there has been, and continues to be,

Any Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1
shall give written notice of such termination to the other Parties to this

Sections 8.6, 13.1, 13.3, 13.6, 13.8, 13.9; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10.1(c) or

willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by such Party or for Fraud by
such Party and all rights and remedies of a non-breaching Party under this
Agreement in the case of any such willful and intentional breach or Fraud, at
law and in equity, shall be preserved, including the right to recover
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Except to the extent otherwise
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Parties agree that, if

(ii) Any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement (whether in
respect of pre-Closing or post-Closing period), including under Section
11.1(a)(ii) or 11.1(b)(ii) and under Section 11.2(b), shall survive until
fully discharged in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(iii) No indemnifying Party shall have any liability for indemnification
claims made under this Article XI with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty unless a Claim Notice in respect of such claim is
timely given in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the applicable
Expiration Date. If a Claim Notice has been timely given in accordance with
this Agreement on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date, then the
applicable representation or warranty shall survive as to such Indemnification
Claim until such Indemnification Claim has been finally resolved.

 

(e) _Calculation of Losses_. In calculating amounts payable to any
Stockholder Indemnitee or Parent Indemnitee (each such person, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") for a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount
of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other
Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made and shall be computed
net of (i) payments actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party under any insurance policy (other than the RandW Policy) with respect to
such Losses ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the amount of any such
payments shall be adjusted to account for the cost incurred by an Indemnified
Party for increased insurance premiums (other than in connection with the RandW
Policy) and (B) nothing contained herein or otherwise shall create any
obligation on the part of any Indemnified Party to pursue any insurance
recovery with respect to any Losses other than under the RandW Policy; (ii) any
prior or subsequent actual recovery by the Indemnified Party from any Person
with respect to such Losses ( _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained
herein or otherwise shall create any obligation on the part of any Indemnified
Party to pursue any such recovery with respect to any Losses other than under
the RandW Policy); and (iii) the amount of any net Tax benefit, which shall be
measured by actual cash Tax savings, that is attributable to any deduction or
loss resulting from or arising out of the relevant Loss and that is actually
realized by the Indemnified Party during or prior to the taxable year in which
the Indemnified Party receives the relevant indemnification payment. In
addition, each Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonably efforts to
mitigate any Losses that an Indemnified Party asserts under this _Article X_
within a reasonable period of time following the discovery by such Indemnified
Party of the fact, event or circumstances giving rise to such Losses (and, for
an indemnified Person that is not a natural person, the bringing to the
attention of a responsible officer thereof of such fact, event or
circumstance). In the event that an Indemnified Party shall

 



68  fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such
Losses, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein,
the indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified
Party for such portion of any Loss that could reasonably have been avoided if
the Indemnified Party had made such efforts.

 

(f) _Recovery_. In the event that any Losses are suffered by any one or
more Indemnified Parties for which any such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Article XI and any such Indemnified Party is
indemnified by an indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, then such
Losses shall be deemed to have been fully satisfied and shall no longer exist
and, therefore, any further recovery by such Indemnified Party or any other
indemnified Party from any indemnifying Party for such same Losses would
constitute an unintended "double" recovery and shall be prohibited under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.3(f) is intended solely
to preclude "double" recovery for such same Losses, and nothing contained
herein shall be construed to preclude recovery for different Losses caused or
deemed to be caused by the same event or similar Losses incurred by multiple
Indemnitees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Indemnitees shall not
be required to pay over to the Stockholders Representative (for the benefit
of the Stockholders) any amounts recovered pursuant to the RandW Policy, unless
such amounts are duplicative of amounts paid by the Stockholders
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders) with respect to any
Indemnification Claims by the Parent or Merger Sub under Section 11.1(a)(i).

(g) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Escrow_. 

(i) From and after the Closing, the remedies provided in this Article XI
shall be the sole and exclusive legal remedies of the Parties with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and any
of their respective current or former businesses, operations, facilities or
properties, except in the case of Fraud and except for claims by the Parent
Indemnitees for recovery under the RandW Policy.

(ii) Any indemnity amounts payable to a Parent Indemnitee in accordance
with this Article XI shall be paid, if and to the extent there are any funds
remaining in the Escrow Account, first from the Indemnification Escrow Amount
(and any interest thereon) in the Escrow Account by delivery of joint written
instructions from the Stockholders Representative and the Parent to the
Escrow Agent to pay to such Parent Indemnitee an amount equal to the lesser of
(A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount (and any interest thereon) remaining in
the Escrow Account (without taking into account such release) and (B) the
amount of such Indemnification Claim submitted by the Parent Indemnitees in
accordance with this Article XI. Any amounts payable to a Parent Indemnitee
in accordance with this Article XI in excess of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (and any interest thereon) remaining in the Escrow Account (without
taking into account such release) or following the date when there are
no funds remaining in the Escrow Account shall, at the election of the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), be satisfied in
cash or Specified Parent Common Stock, which shall have a market value
measured as of the market close on the Business Day immediately preceding the
date of final and conclusive settlement of the applicable Indemnification
Claim.

 



69 (iii) On the First Escrow Release Date, the Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall prepare and deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release one-half of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount (and any interest thereon), remaining in the
Escrow Account held by the Escrow Agent less the aggregated amount of all
Losses specified in any then-unresolved good faith claims for indemnification
made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to the
Stockholders Representative (for the benefit of the Stockholders).

(iv) On the Second Escrow Release Date, the Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall prepare and deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release all of the remaining
Indemnification Escrow Amount (and any interest thereon), if any, held in the
Escrow Account held by the Escrow Agent less the aggregated amount of all
Losses specified in any then-unresolved good faith claims for indemnification
made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to the
Stockholders Representative (for the benefit of the Stockholders).

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
agree that recovery for Indemnification Claims by the Parent Indemnitees
pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i) shall be subject to the following requirements:

 

(i) Until the Second Escrow Release Date and while funds remain in the
Escrow Account, the Parent Indemnitees shall first seek recovery from the
Escrow Account for Indemnification Claims pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i).
After the Second Escrow Release Date, or at the point when no funds remain in
the Escrow Account, the Stockholders shall not have any liability for any
Losses arising pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), other than in the case of Fraud
and except with respect to any breach relating to a Company Fundamental
Representation.

 

(ii) With respect to any breach relating to any representation or warranty
contained in the Company Fundamental Representations or any representation or
warranty contained in the first two sentences of Section 5.9(b), at the point
(A) when no funds remain in the Escrow Account and (B) no recovery is allowed
under the RandW Policy, the Parent Indemnitees may seek recovery from the
Stockholders subject, in each case, to the applicable limitations contained in
this Article XI; _provided, however_ , that after the point when no funds
remain in the Escrow Account and prior to seeking recovery under the RandW
Policy with respect to any such breaches, the Parent Indemnitees may seek
recovery directly from the Stockholders in an amount up to, but not exceeding,
$1,325,000 in the aggregate (which together with the Indemnification Escrow
Amount is equal to the required retention amount under the RandW Policy).

 

11.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) Each Indemnitee agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts
giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this Article XI
or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, such Indemnitee reasonably
believes is likely to give rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant
to this Article XI, such Indemnitee must assert its claim

 



70  for indemnification under this Article XI (each, an " _Indemnification
Claim_ ") by providing a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to
the indemnifying Party allegedly required to provide indemnification
protection under this Article XI specifying, in reasonable detail, the nature
and basis for such Indemnification Claim or potential Indemnification Claim
(e.g., the underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged
to have been breached). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnitees failure
to send or delay in sending a Claim Notice will not relieve the indemnifying
Party from liability hereunder with respect to such Indemnification Claim,
except to the extent the indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure or delay and except as is otherwise provided herein, including in
Section 11.3(d).

 

(b) In the event of the assertion of any third party Indemnification Claim
for which, by the terms hereof, an indemnifying Party is obligated to
indemnify an Indemnitee, the indemnifying Party will have the right, at such
indemnifying Partys expense, to assume the defense of same (so long as prior
to assuming the defense of same, such indemnifying Party acknowledges its
obligation to indemnify the indemnified Party in writing) including the
appointment and selection of counsel on behalf of the Indemnitee so long as
such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
_ however_ , to the extent that the object of such third party
Indemnification Claim is to obtain an injunction, restraining order,
declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnitee
which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business,
operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnitee, (ii) if the
named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both the Indemnitees and the indemnifying Party and the
former shall have been advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the
indemnifying Party) that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to them that are different from or additional to those available to
indemnifying Party, (iii) if the indemnifying Party fails to provide
reasonable assurance to the Indemnitee of its financial capacity to defend the
claim and provide indemnification with respect to such claim, (iv) if the
Indemnitee demonstrates there is a reasonable probability that the claim would
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (including potentially establishing a precedent or custom adverse
to the Indemnitee, whether or not monetary damages are also asserted in
connection with such claim) the indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume the defense of same, but rather Indemnitee shall control the defense
(although the indemnifying Party will have reasonable information and
consultation rights in connection therewith and the Indemnitee not shall
settle such Indemnification Claim without the other indemnifying Partys
prior consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If the indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such
third party Indemnification Claim, it shall within 30 days notify
the Indemnitee in writing of its intent to do so. The indemnifying Party will
have the right to settle or compromise or take any corrective or remediation
action with respect to any such Indemnification Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by the
indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the
indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee will be entitled, at its own cost, to
participate with the indemnifying Party in the defense of any such
Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
such third-party Indemnification Claim but fails to diligently prosecute such
Indemnification Claim, or if the indemnifying Party 

 



71  does not assume the defense of any such Indemnification Claim, the
Indemnitee may assume control of such defense and in the event it is finally
determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article XII that the
Indemnification Claim was a matter for which the indemnifying Party is
required to provide indemnification under the terms of this Article XI, the
indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of
such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses). The Party
in charge of the defense shall keep the other party reasonably apprised at all
times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with
respect thereto. If any Indemnitee desires to participate in, but not
control, any such defense or settlement it may do so at its sole cost and
expense.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, (i) that does not unconditionally release the
Indemnitees from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such Indemnification Claim, (ii) that imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against Indemnitee, or (iii) under which the Indemnitee would be
required to pay any portion of any monetary damages arising as a result of the
claim, in each case without the Indemnitees prior written consent.

(d) Any indemnity payments made under this Agreement shall be treated for
all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Cash Merger Consideration
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

11.5 _Materiality_. For purposes of this Article XI, any failure of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement to be true and correct
and any Losses arising out of or resulting from such failure shall be
determined without giving effect to any qualifications regarding materiality,
the use of the word "material" in the definitions of "Company Material
Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications
contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 

11.6 _No Reliance; Waiver of Certain Damages_.

 

(a) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY CONTAINED IN ARTICLE
V AND IN ANY CERTIFICATION OF A RESPONSIBLE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY PURSUANT
TO SECTION 9.2(d) CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY TO THE PARENT AND MERGER SUB IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE STOCKHOLDERS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE VII CONSTITUTE THE SOLE
AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE STOCKHOLDERS TO THE PARENT
AND MERGER SUB IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. THE REPRESENTATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB CONTAINED IN ARTICLE
VI AND IN ANY CERTIFICATION OF A RESPONSIBLE OFFICER OF PARENT OR MERGER SUB
PURSUANT TO SECTION 9.3(C) CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE 

 



72  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB TO THE COMPANY IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR
SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, NO PARTY MAKES ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PARTY OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER MADE BY SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF
ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF, OR ANY PERSONS RELIANCE ON,
ANY INFORMATION, DISCLOSURE OR OTHER DOCUMENT OR OTHER MATERIAL MADE AVAILABLE
TO THE PARENT OR TO THE COMPANY IN ANY DATA ROOM, ELECTRONIC DATA ROOM,
MANAGEMENT PRESENTATION OR IN ANY OTHER FORM IN EXPECTATION OF, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT). EXCEPT FOR
SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROJECTION, FORECAST,
STATEMENT, OR INFORMATION MADE, COMMUNICATED, OR FURNISHED (ORALLY OR IN
WRITING) TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING OPINIONS,
INFORMATION, PROJECTIONS, OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OR MAY BE PROVIDED TO
ANY PARTY OR ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, AGENT OR REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCH
PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES). 

(b) No Party nor any Affiliate of a Party shall assert or threaten, and
each Party hereby waives and shall cause such Affiliates to waive, any claim
or other method of recovery, in contract, in tort or under applicable Law,
against any Person that is not a Party (or a successor to a Party) relating to
the Transactions.

 

(c) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR (I) PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES OR (II) INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL DAMAGES, DAMAGE TO
REPUTATION OR LOSS OF GOODWILL (CLAUSES (I) AND (II) COLLECTIVELY, " _EXCLUDED
DAMAGES_ "), WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE;
_PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ , THAT THIS SECTION 11.6(c) SHALL NOT LIMIT A PARTYS
RIGHT TO RECOVERY UNDER THIS ARTICLE XI FOR ANY EXCLUDED DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT
SUCH PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH
A MATTER FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION
UNDER THIS ARTICLE XI.

ARTICLE XII

 

CONSENT TO JURISDICTION

 

12.1 _Sole and Exclusive Method for Resolution of Disputes_. Any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in
this Article XII, which shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the
resolution of any such disputes.

 



73 12.2 _Negotiation Between Executives_. The Parties involved in the
dispute shall attempt to resolve the dispute between them promptly by
negotiation between executives who have authority to settle the controversy
and who are at a comparable or higher level of management than the persons who
have been involved in the negotiation of this Agreement. Any Party may give
the other Parties written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal
course of business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements under this
Section 12.2 shall fall away if there has been no resolution within 60 days
after the delivery of the initial notice. Within seven days after delivery of
such notice, the receiving Party or Parties shall submit to the other a
written response. The notice and response shall include (a) a statement of
that Partys position and a summary of the arguments supporting that position,
and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party and
of any other person who will accompany the executive. Within 15 days after
delivery of the initial notice, the executives of the Parties shall meet at a
mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter continue to meet as often
as they reasonably deem necessary, to use their good faith and reasonable
efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute. All negotiations pursuant to this
clause shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence, and any documents
or information exchanged pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be returned
immediately following the earlier of the conclusion of negotiations or the
institution of litigation.

 

12.3 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The Parties irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Texas in Harris County or the federal
courts located in the Southern District of the State of Texas, for the
purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions
(and each agrees that no such Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought by it except in such courts). The Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and agree not to plead or claim) any
objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions in the courts of Texas in Harris County or
the federal courts located in the Southern District of the State of Texas or
that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and agree that service of process upon such Party in any
such Proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice in
accordance with Section 13.3 of this Agreement. Each of the Parties also
agrees that any final and non-appealable judgment against a Party in
connection with any Proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such Party
and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or
exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such award or judgment.

 

12.4 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR TO DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

 



74 12.5 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary
damages, each of the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the jurisdiction
provided in Section 12.3 and all such rights and remedies at law or in equity
may be cumulative, except as may be limited by Article XI and the following
sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is explicitly
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the
Parents obligation to consummate the Transactions only in the event that (a)
all conditions in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (other than those not satisfied
primarily due to the Parents failure to have performed its obligations under
this Agreement) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (or,
with respect to certificates to be delivered at the Closing, are capable of
being satisfied upon the Closing) at the time when the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to Section 2.2; and (b) the Stockholders Representative has
irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted, then the
Closing pursuant to Article II will occur. The Parties further agree that no
Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 12.5 and each Party waives any objection that
there is an adequate remedy at law or that the award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason of law or equity or any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

ARTICLE XIII

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

13.1 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented at any time prior to the Closing only by written agreement of
the Parties hereto.

13.2 _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. The rights and remedies of the
Parties are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay
by any Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement
or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a
waiver of such right, power, or privilege and no single or partial exercise of
any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other
right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law,
(a) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the
specific instance for which it is given; and (b) no notice to or demand on
one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that Party or of
the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action
without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement.

13.3 _Notices_. Any notice, demand or communication required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered personally, by
reputable overnight delivery service or other courier or by certified mail,

benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns. No Party
may assign or transfer this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent may assign any of its
rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than its
obligation to issue the Specified Parent Common Stock in accordance with this
Agreement) without the prior written consent of the other Parties to any
Subsidiary (including the Surviving Corporation or LLC Sub from and after the
Closing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that the Parent and, from and after the Closing,
the Surviving

 



76  Corporation or LLC Sub may assign any of their respective rights under the
Transaction Documents by way of security to any banks or holders of debt
securities or financial institutions or hedge counterparties or any other
Person lending money, providing credit or otherwise providing financing to any
of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, including in connection with any and all subsequent re-financings.
Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be
null, void and ineffective. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no assignment pursuant to this Section 13.4 shall release the assigning Party
of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement.

 

13.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of (a) the Parties and their successors and

Article XI), (d) the Company Indemnitees (solely with respect to rights to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.12) and (e) the Stockholders (solely
with respect to Article IV, Article XI, this Article XIII and Article XIV).
Except as provided by the foregoing sentence, (i) none of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by any third party,
including any creditor of any Party or any of their Affiliates, and (ii) no
such third party shall obtain any right under any provision of this Agreement
or shall by reasons of any such provision make any claim in respect of any
liability (or otherwise) against any other Party.

 

13.6 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OR PRINCIPLES THAT MIGHT REFER THE GOVERNANCE
OR CONSTRUCTION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

 

13.7 _Entire Agreement_. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive the execution of this Agreement, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, among the Parties or
between any of them with respect to such subject matter.

 

13.8 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
(a) such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction; and (b) the
Parties shall promptly amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any such provision contained herein that is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law to the intent of the Parties.

 



77 13.9 _Representation by Counsel_. Each of the Parties agrees that it has
been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and that
it has executed the same upon the advice of such independent counsel. Each
Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this
Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not
be construed against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the
Parties waive the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

13.10 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding
to the Sections of this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure
of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations
or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent from such item,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to such other representations or
warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and
solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to the Company.
The headings, if any, of the individual sections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations
and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure is
not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of
the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties to determine whether any
obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any
schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 

13.11 _PDF; Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by PDF
signatures by any Party and such signature shall be deemed binding for all
purposes hereof, without delivery of an original signature being thereafter
required. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same document.

THE STOCKHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE
