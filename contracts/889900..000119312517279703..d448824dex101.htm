payment of any consideration therefor. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to effectuate such cancellation.

 

Section 2.2 _Closing_.

 

(a) The sale and purchase of the Units shall take place at a closing (the "
_Closing_ ") to be held at the Houston, Texas offices of Gibson, Dunn and
Crutcher LLP at 10:00 a.m., Houston time on the second Business Day following
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of all
conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in  _Article VIII_
(other than such conditions as may, by their

 



11  terms, only be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place or
at such other time or on such other date as the Sellers Representative and
the Buyer mutually may agree in writing. The day on which the Closing takes
place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 

(b) At the Closing:

(i) the Buyer shall issue or pay, as applicable, or cause to be issued or
paid, as applicable, to each applicable Seller:

(A) the Aggregate Stock Closing Consideration, free and clear of all

and terminate all applicable obligations and liabilities of the Company and
any of its Affiliates related thereto, as specified in the Debt Payoff Letters
and in accordance with this Agreement;

 

(iv) the Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered on behalf of the Company

Instructions and in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company any Estimated Transaction Expenses that constitute

contrary contained herein, no fractional Buyer Common Shares shall be issued
to the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers in exchange for Units,
no dividend or distribution with respect to Buyer Common Shares shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights

share, at Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers Representative, on
behalf of and for delivery to each applicable Seller who otherwise would
receive any such fractional share, an aggregate amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Price Per Share by (ii) the

receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)(i)(A)_ (such aggregate amount, the

reasonably requested by the Buyer to evidence and record such discharge and
release as promptly as practicable; and (iv) the payee shall return to the
Company all instruments evidencing the applicable Payoff Indebtedness
(including all notes) and all collateral securing the applicable Payoff
Indebtedness (each such payoff letter, a " _Debt Payoff Letter_ ").

(e) With respect to any Transaction Expenses which will not have been paid in
full prior to the Closing Date, at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers Representative shall submit to the Buyer reasonably
satisfactory documentation setting forth an itemized list of all, and amounts
of all, Transaction Expenses, including the identity of each payee, dollar
amounts owed, wire instructions and any other information necessary to effect
the final payment in full thereof, and copies of final invoices from each such
payee (subject to redaction to preserve confidential information of the
Sellers or attorney-client communications) (the " _Transaction Expenses Payoff
Instructions_ ").

Aggregate Cash Closing Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount

Working Capital based on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (B) Indebtedness (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), (C) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ ") and (D) all Transaction
Expenses that are accrued or expected to be due and remain unpaid as of the
Closing (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ") (with each of Estimated Net
Working Capital, Estimated Cash and Estimated Indebtedness determined as of
the Calculation Time and, except for Estimated Transaction Expenses, without
giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein) and (iii) on the basis
of the foregoing, a calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price; _provided_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, that, in making such calculations, Estimated Net
Working Capital shall exclude any amounts relating to or included in Estimated
Cash, Estimated Indebtedness, and Estimated Transaction Expenses to avoid any
double-counting of any particular adjustment. Estimated Net Working Capital,
Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Cash shall be calculated in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Balance
Sheet ( _provided_ , that in the event of a conflict between GAAP
and consistent application thereof, GAAP shall prevail), subject to such
differences in accounting principles, policies and procedures as are set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ of the Disclosure Schedules (GAAP as so modified
pursuant to  _Schedule_ __ _ 2.3_, the " _Applicable Accounting Principles_
"). All calculations of Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness,
Estimated Cash and Estimated Transaction Expenses shall be accompanied by
a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Company certifying that
such estimates have been calculated in good faith in accordance with this
Agreement. Without limiting any of the Buyers other rights or remedies, the

faith or in a manner consistent with the terms hereof by delivering to the
Sellers Representative a written notice of its disagreement at least two
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Buyer_ __ _s
Notice of Disagreement_ "), specifying in reasonable detail the nature of its
objections to the

 



14  Sellers Representatives estimates. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer
in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any objections set forth in the
Buyers Notice of Disagreement prior to the Closing, and the Sellers
Representative shall make such revisions to the disputed items as may be
mutually agreed between the Sellers Representative and the Buyer; _provided_ ,
that if and to the extent that the Buyer and the Sellers Representative have
not resolved all such differences by the close of business on the Business Day
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the parties shall proceed to close
based upon the Preliminary Closing Statement as prepared by the Sellers
Representative (with such modifications as may have been mutually agreed
between the Sellers Representative and the Buyer prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_) or as otherwise agreed to by the
Sellers Representative and the Buyer before the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, any failure of the Buyer to raise any objection or dispute in the
Buyers Notice of Disagreement shall not in any way prejudice Buyers right
to raise any matter in the Final Closing Statement.

Section 2.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to the Sellers Representative a written statement

without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein); _provided_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, that, in making such calculations, Closing Net
Working Capital shall exclude any amounts included in Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, and Closing Transaction Expenses to avoid any double-counting
of any particular adjustment. Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Cash shall be calculated in accordance with the
Applicable Accounting Principles. All calculations of Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction
Expenses shall be accompanied by a certificate of a duly authorized officer of
the Buyer certifying that such amounts have been prepared in good faith in
accordance with this Agreement. If the Buyer does not deliver the Final
Closing Statement to the Sellers Representative within 90 days after the
Closing Date, then, at the election of the Sellers Representative (acting in
its sole discretion), either (x) the Sellers Representative may prepare and
present the Final Closing Statement within an additional 30 days thereafter or
(y) the Preliminary Closing Statement will be deemed to be the Final Closing
Statement in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_. If the Sellers
Representative elects to prepare the Final Closing Statement in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence, then all subsequent references in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ to the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative, on the other hand, will be deemed to be references to the
Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,

disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying the nature and amount
of any dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Final
Closing Statement. The Sellers Representative and the Sellers shall be deemed
to have agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses not
specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and
amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_.

(c) During the 15-day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement
by the Sellers Representative to the Buyer, the parties in good faith shall
seek to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
the computation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses as specified therein. Any
disputed items resolved in writing between the Sellers Representative and the
Buyer within such 15-day period shall be final and binding with respect to
such items, and if the Sellers Representative and the Buyer agree in writing
on the resolution of each disputed item specified by the Sellers
Representative in the Notice of Disagreement and the amount of the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing
Transaction Expenses, the amounts so determined shall be final and binding on
the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Sellers Representative and the
Buyer have not resolved all such differences by the end of such 15-day
period, either party shall have the right to submit, in writing, to an
independent public accounting firm (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
each item in the Final Closing Statement remaining in dispute after such 15th
day. Within 10 days of submission of any such disputed amount to the
Independent Accounting Firm, both the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall enter into the Independent Accounting Firms standard engagement letter
and shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render its decision
within 45 days of its referral. The Independent Accounting Firm shall make a
written determination as to each such disputed item and the amount of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing
Transaction Expenses, which determination shall be final and binding on the
parties for all purposes hereunder and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those
items and amounts in the Sellers Representatives and the Buyers respective
calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses that are identified as being items and
amounts to which the Sellers Representative and the Buyer have been unable
to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be KPMG LLP or, if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by the Sellers Representative
and the Buyer. If KPMG declines to accept such engagement and the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer are unable to select an alternative Independent
Accounting Firm within five Business Days of the expiration of the 15-day
period referred to above, then either the Sellers Representative or the Buyer
may thereafter request that the American Arbitration Association select an
Independent Accounting Firm. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30 days following the
submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written determination of
the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.9_. In
acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled
to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

 



16 (d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_, including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
and of any enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the
Sellers and the Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation
shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values
of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the
merits of the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the
Representatives of each party incurred in connection with the preparation or
review of the Final Closing Statement and preparation or review of any Notice
of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such party.

(e) The Buyer and the Sellers Representative will, and will cause the
Company to afford to the Buyer and its Representatives, in the case of the
Sellers Representative, and to afford to the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives, in the case of the Buyer, reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company and to any other information
reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_. Each party shall authorize its
accountants to disclose work papers generated by such accountants in
connection with preparing and reviewing the calculations of the Net Working
Capital, Cash, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses as specified in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_; _provided_ , that such accountants shall not be
obligated to make any work papers available except in accordance with such
accountants disclosure procedures and then only after the non-client party
has signed an agreement relating to access to such work papers in form and
substance acceptable to such accountants.

 

(f) The Estimated Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as
follows:

 

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means
an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_
_minus_ the Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_ (B) the Estimated
Indebtedness _minus_ the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, _plus_ (C) the Closing Cash as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ _minus_ the Estimated Cash, 
_plus_ (D) the Estimated Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Closing Transaction
Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In
such event, the Buyer shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of and for delivery by the Sellers Representative to
each applicable Seller.

 



17 (iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount.
In such event, the Sellers shall each pay their Pro Rata Share of the Net
Adjustment Amount to the Buyer. In the event that any Seller shall fail to pay
such amount of such deficiency within the time period set forth in _Section
2.4(g)_, the Buyer may, in its sole discretion, deliver written notice to the
Escrow Agent and the Sellers Representative specifying such amount, and the
Escrow Agent shall deliver a number Buyer Common Shares from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund to the Buyer equal to (x) the amount of such deficiency divided
by (y) the Price Per Share, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ , that the defaulting Seller (A) shall promptly restore
the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the extent any Buyer Common Shares are so
distributed therefrom and (B) shall remain liable in the event the Indemnity
Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the amount of such deficiency. No failure
on the part of the Buyer to deliver a notice as specified in the immediately
preceding sentence shall relieve the Seller of the obligation to pay the
amount of such deficiency to the Buyer.

(g) Payments in respect of _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_ shall be made in cash
within three Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated in writing by the party entitled to such payment at least two
Business Days prior to such payment date.

 

Section 2.5 _Tax Treatment and Purchase Price Allocation_. The parties to this
Agreement intend that the purchase by the Buyer and sale by the Sellers
contemplated hereunder shall be treated for tax purposes in a manner
consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-6, Situation 2. The Buyer shall prepare and
provide to the Sellers Representative within 60 days after all adjustments to
the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ have been completed in
accordance with the terms thereof, a schedule (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the amounts paid and the liabilities
assumed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
adjusted as necessary to determine the purchase price of the Company assets
Buyer is treated as purchasing hereunder for federal income tax purposes (the
" _Tax Allocation Purchase Price_ "), among such assets. The Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the general
principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations pursuant
thereto or any successor provision. Unless the Sellers Representative objects
to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule within 30 days after receipt
thereof, such Schedule shall become final. If the Sellers Representative
objects to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule within 30 days of receipt,
then the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree, within 30 days of the Sellers Representatives
objection to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, to an allocation of the
Tax Allocation Purchase Price among the purchased assets hereunder for federal
income tax purposes that is consistent with the allocation methodology
provided by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
cannot agree on an appropriate Allocation within the time period specified in
the preceding sentence, then the Buyer and the Sellers shall not be bound by
the Allocation. If, however, the Allocation is agreed to by the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Sellers
Representative does not

 



18  object to the Purchase Price allocation Schedule delivered Buyer within the
period specified in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_), then the Buyer and the Sellers
agree to report based on the Allocation and shall file all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed in connection with transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a manner consistent therewith, and neither the Buyer nor the
Sellers shall take any position (whether in Tax proceedings, on Tax Returns,
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation statement except as
may be subsequently adjusted pursuant to an audit by IRS or by court decision.

 

Section 2.6 _Sellers Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller, by his, her or its execution of this Agreement, hereby
consents to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and to the appointment of
MS Incentive Plan Holdco, LLC as such Sellers representative and attorney-in-
fact, with full power of substitution to act on behalf of the Sellers to the
extent and in the manner set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
All decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Sellers
Representative with respect to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all decisions,
actions, consents and instructions relating to the defense or settlement of
any claims for indemnification, and the Sellers Representatives allocation of
the Aggregate Closing Consideration or any other payment made by the Buyer
hereunder among the Sellers, shall be binding upon all Sellers. The provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, including the power of attorney granted hereby,
are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest
and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more Sellers, or by
operation of Law, whether by death or other event.

 

(b) In the event the Sellers Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the Sellers (acting
by the vote of the Sellers who immediately prior to the Closing held a
projected interest in the Purchase Price equal to or greater than a majority
of the projected Purchase Price) shall select another representative to fill
the vacancy of the Sellers Representative, and such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Sellers Representative for all
purposes under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

(c) The Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any decision, action, consent or
instruction of the Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
as being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the Sellers, and the
Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done
in accordance with any such decision, action, consent or instruction. The
Buyer shall be entitled to unconditionally assume that any action taken or
omitted, or any document executed by, MS Incentive Plan Holdco, LLC,
purporting to act as the Sellers Representative under or pursuant to this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has been unconditionally
authorized by Sellers to be taken, omitted to be taken, or executed on their
behalf so that they will be legally bound thereby, and no Seller shall
institute any claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding against the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates alleging that MS Incentive Plan Holdco, LLC did
not have the authority to act as the Sellers Representative on behalf of
Sellers in connection with any such action, omission or execution. No
modification or revocation of the power of attorney granted by the Sellers
herein to MS Incentive Plan Holdco, LLC to serve as the Sellers

 



19  Representative shall be effective as against the Buyer until it has received
a document signed by all Sellers effecting said modification or revocation.
The Buyer and its Affiliates are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by the Sellers Representative and any acts done by
the Buyer in accordance with any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Sellers Representative.

 

(d) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Sellers Representative while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment. The Sellers shall, severally (in proportions
based on each Sellers Pro Rata Share), indemnify the Sellers Representative
and hold the Sellers Representative harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on
the part of the Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Sellers Representatives duties
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including the reasonable
fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Sellers Representative.
This right of indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
Any Person dealing with the Sellers Representative is entitled to rely on the
actions taken by, and consents and approvals given by, the Sellers
Representative without the need for further investigation. A Person shall be
entitled to rely on the Sellers Representatives actions, consents and
approvals notwithstanding any knowledge of the relying Person. No Person shall
have any liability for relying on the Sellers Representative in the foregoing
manner.

 

Section 2.7 _Withholding_. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it determines it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
doing so is reasonably practicable, the Buyer shall provide written notice to
the Sellers Representative prior to withholding any amounts under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith
and at the Sellers Representatives expense with the Sellers
Representatives efforts to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such deduction or withholding, including
by providing any certificates or forms that are reasonably requested by the
Sellers Representative to establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any
deduction or withholding. Any amounts that are so deducted and withheld shall
be paid to the relevant Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Seller.

interruption of the conduct of the business of the Company. The Buyers
environmental due diligence shall be limited to a visual site inspection and
limited environmental compliance evaluation of the assets, the real property,
and the operations of the Company, and in no event shall the Buyer perform
any invasive testing or sampling of the ambient air, soil, surface water or
ground water absent the express written consent of the Sellers Representative,

operating safety rules, regulations and operating policies of the Company and
any third Person operator of any Companys assets. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Buyer shall have no right of access to, and the Sellers

available to the Buyer information relating to bids received from others in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and information and analysis (including financial
analysis) relating to such bids; (ii) without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned

to which consents the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, it being understood that such commercially reasonable efforts do not
include the payment of money or any other consideration).

(b) The Buyer hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each of
the operators of the assets of the Company and each of the Seller Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses attributable to personal injury,

associated with the Losses had been informed, to the extent arising out of,
resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental property
assessment or other due diligence activity conducted by the Buyer or any of
its representatives with respect to the real property or other assets of the
Company, EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART,
THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY OF THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY LOSSES ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT

documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other party
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms
of the confidentiality agreement dated May 10, 2017 between the Buyer and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing Date, at which time such Confidentiality
Agreement and the obligations of the parties under this _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)_ shall terminate. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior
to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

(b) For a period of two years following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
not, and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates and shall undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective Representatives of
such Seller and its Affiliates not to, disclose to any third party, any
Confidential Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Seller or
its Affiliates may furnish such portion (and only such portion) of the
Confidential Information as such Seller or such Affiliate reasonably
determines it is legally obligated to disclose if: (i) it receives a request
to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms
of a subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued by a Governmental
Authority; (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such request or except in
the case of a request for information from regulators pursuant to a routine
audit, it notifies the Buyer of the existence, terms and circumstances
surrounding such request and consults with the Buyer on the advisability of
taking steps available under applicable Law to resist or narrow such request;
(iii) it exercises its commercially

 



51  reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Confidential
Information; and (iv) disclosure of such Confidential Information is required
to prevent such Seller or such Affiliate from being held in contempt or
becoming subject to any other penalty under applicable Law. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Confidential Information_ " consists of all information
and data relating to the Company or the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than data or information that is or becomes available to the public
other than as a result of a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ or that was
independently developed by such Person without use or reference to
Confidential Information or was in their rightful possession before the
disclosure of the applicable Confidential Information to them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any individual Seller may disclose
Confidential Information to the extent reasonably required in the performance
of its duties as an employee of the Company or its Affiliates following the
Closing and (ii) each Seller and its Affiliates may disclose Confidential

and (C) to comply with applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any
governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory organization or stock exchange.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Buyer
acknowledges that NGP and Denham manage a variety of private equity funds that
currently own, and may in the future acquire, interests in portfolio companies
in the oilfield services business and that none of the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ shall apply to NGP, Denham or to any members, owners,
officers, managers, directors, partners, employees, agents or representatives
of NGP or Denham, unless Confidential Information has been actually disclosed
to any such fund or portfolio company of NGP or Denham, as applicable, in
which case the provisions hereof shall only apply to such fund or portfolio
company. For purposes hereof, the fact that a representative of NGP or Denham
serves as a member of the board of directors or equivalent governing body of
any private equity fund or portfolio company shall not, in and of itself,
constitute actual disclosure of Confidential Information to such fund or
portfolio company, and the use of mental impressions (i.e. impressions not
written or otherwise reduced to record) by NGP or Denham or any of their
members, owners, officers, managers, directors, partners, employees, agents
or representatives shall not be a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_.

(c) Effective as of the Closing, each Seller hereby assigns to the Buyer all
of such Sellers right, title and interest in and to any confidentiality
agreements entered into by such Seller (or its Affiliates or Representatives)
and each Person (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives)
who entered into any such agreement or to whom Confidential Information was
provided in connection with a business combination involving the Company or
its Affiliates. From and after the Closing, each Seller will take all actions
reasonably requested by the Buyer in order to assist in enforcing the rights
so assigned. Each Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such Person to return to such Seller any documents, files, data or
other materials constituting Confidential Information that was provided to
such Person in connection with the consideration of any such business
combination.

Ancillary Agreements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer shall not be
required by this Section to take or agree to undertake any action, including
entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement,

Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (B) limit the Buyers freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, the
Company or any of its assets or businesses or any of the Buyers or its
Affiliates other assets or businesses or (C) limit the Buyers ability to
acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership with respect to, the

provided that any such amount required to be paid by the Company prior to
Closing that remains unpaid at the Closing shall be deemed a Transaction
Expense for purposes of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS 

Section 7.1 _Tax Returns_. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company after the
Closing Date that relate to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the Sellers Representative shall
be responsible for preparing and filing any U.S. federal income tax
partnership returns of the Company and any state income tax partnership
returns of the Company to the extent neither the Company nor the Buyer would
have any liability or potential liability for any Taxes reflected on such
returns, in each case to the extent such returns relate to taxable periods
(or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. In preparing
such Tax Returns, the Transaction Expenses shall be treated as having accrued
on or before the Closing Date. The Sellers shall be responsible, severally
and not jointly, in accordance with such Sellers Pro Rata Share, for all
Taxes that are shown as due on any such Tax Return (a) relating to any taxable
year or other taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date ("
_Pre-Closing _

 



57   _Period_ ") or (b) attributable to the pre-Closing portion of any taxable
period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "). No later than five Business Days prior to the due date
of any such Tax Return, each Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of Taxes
that are its responsibility with respect to such Tax Return under the
prior sentence, except to the extent that all or a portion of the amount of
such Taxes (together with interest and penalties relating thereto, if any) is
reflected in the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ in a manner that actually reduces the Purchase
Price. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in accordance with past practices of the Company, and submitted
(with copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation
then available) to the Sellers Representative for the Sellers Representatives
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) not less than thirty days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return, or, for any Tax Return due to be filed within thirty days
after the Closing Date, as soon as practicable after Closing. If the Sellers
Representative disputes any item on any Tax Return delivered to it under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_, shall notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items)
within fifteen days and shall provide an explanation of the reason for its
objection. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall act in good faith
to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return
is required to be filed. If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative cannot
resolve any disputed item, the question shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm, and the fees of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
borne equally by the Seller and the Buyer. If any disputed item has not been
resolved by the time a Tax Return is required to be filed, or the Sellers
Representatives period for review and objection to such Tax Return has not
expired by the time a Tax Return is required to be filed, the Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by the Buyer, and if the disputed item is
resolved thereafter in a manner different than as reflected on such Tax
Return, the Buyer shall file an amended Tax Return that reflects such
resolution.

 

Section 7.2 _Cooperation_. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
cooperate fully, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by either the Buyer or the
Sellers Representative, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant
to this _Article VII_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a "
_Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to such Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Buyers or the Sellers Representatives
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.

 

Section 7.3 _Transfer Taxes_. In the event that any Transfer Taxes (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, not any Taxes based on or measured by income) are
payable in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Sellers, severally and not jointly, in accordance with each such
Sellers Pro Rata Share, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,
shall each be liable for fifty percent of any and all Transfer Taxes. The
Sellers Representative and the Buyer agree to cooperate in the execution and
delivery of all instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to remit
and/or minimize the amount of any Transfer Taxes. If any Seller is required
by Law to pay any such Transfer Taxes, the Buyer shall promptly reimburse such
Seller within ten days of receipt of written request from such Seller for
fifty percent of such Transfer Taxes. If the Buyer is required by Law to pay
any such Transfer

 



58  Taxes, the Sellers, severally and not jointly, in accordance with each such
Sellers Pro Rata Share, shall promptly reimburse the Buyer within ten days of
receipt of written request from the Buyer for fifty percent of such Transfer
Taxes. The Buyer shall timely file any Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes as
required by Law and shall notify the Sellers Representative when such filings
have been made. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall cooperate and
consult with each other prior to filing any Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes to
ensure that all such Tax Returns are filed in a consistent manner.

 

Section 7.4 _Straddle Period Proration_. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Straddle Period, (i) any property Taxes for the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be equal to the amount of
such property Taxes for such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii)
all other Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined based on an actual closing of the books used
to calculate such Taxes as if such Tax period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. In the case of clause (ii), exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions computed as if the Closing Date was
the last day of the Straddle Period) shall be allocated between the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the
Straddle Period thereafter in proportion to the number of days in each such
portion.

Section 7.5 _Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, except to the extent that Taxes are reflected in
the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.4_ or in the calculation of "Indebtedness" in a manner that actually
reduces the Purchase Price, each Seller shall be liable for, and shall pay,
and each Seller agrees to indemnify and hold the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company) harmless from and against all Pre-Closing Taxes, in
each case severally and not jointly, in accordance with such Sellers Pro Rata
Share. Payment by each Seller of any amount due under this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ shall be made within ten days following written notice from the Buyer.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers indemnification obligations under
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ shall not be subject to any of the limits on
indemnification set forth in _Article IX_.

 

Section 7.6 _Tax Proceedings_. With respect to any Tax for which the Sellers
are responsible under  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ with
respect to a Pre-Closing Period, the Sellers Representative shall have the
right, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, to control the prosecution,
settlement or compromise of any proceeding involving such Tax, _provided,_
_however_ , that to the extent that any such proceeding could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse post-Closing impact on the Buyer or the Company
(a) the Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any such proceeding at its
sole cost and expense if such adverse post-Closing impact is reasonably
expected to be material and (b) the Sellers Representative shall not
settle or otherwise compromise any such proceeding without the Buyers prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, if such settlement or compromise will have a material adverse post-
Closing impact on the Buyer or on the Company.

 



59 Section 7.7 _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the obligations of Sellers set forth in this _Article VII_ shall
survive until sixty days following the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax liability in question.

Section 9.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) A party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") in respect
of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any
person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall deliver
notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Sellers (by means of delivery to
the Sellers Representative) or the Buyer, as applicable (the Sellers or the
Buyer in such case are referred to herein as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
with reasonable promptness after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice
of the Third Party Claim, and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any claim for which any
Seller may be liable as an Indemnifying Party under  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_,
any such Claim Notice shall be delivered to such Seller (as opposed to the
Sellers Representative) and such Seller shall have the rights and obligations
of an Indemnifying Party described in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_. The failure
to deliver a Claim Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



64 (b) If an Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice in respect of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all
Losses that may result from a Third Party Claim that is exclusively for civil
monetary damages at law pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of a Claim Notice from
the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any such Third Party
Claim if the reasonably likely Loss related to such Third Party Claim exceeds
the maximum obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder with respect to
such Third Party Claim unless first consented to in the sole discretion of the
Indemnified Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim to the extent
equitable or permanent injunctive relief is sought by such Third Party Claim
or such Third Party Claim would impose criminal liability on any Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, any such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party with respect
thereto, including, upon reasonable request and at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, providing access to information, making documents
available for inspection and copying and making employees available for
interviews, depositions and trial.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, then:

(i) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (A) the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing
by the Indemnifying Party or (B) the named parties to the Third Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, and counsel to the Indemnified Party reasonably determines
that representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party may present such counsel to the
Indemnified Party with a conflict of interest; and

 

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall make reasonably available to the Indemnifying
Party all pertinent books, records and other documents and materials in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under its or its Affiliates control as are
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party for the defense of such Third
Party Claim, and shall execute such documents and use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such other actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement,
compromise or adjustment relating to, such Third Party Claim, and shall
otherwise cooperate as reasonably requested by Indemnifying Party in the
defense of such Third Party

 



65  Claim; provided that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such
settlement, compromise or judgment (A) involves a finding or admission
of criminal wrongdoing, (B) does not include an unconditional written release
by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from
all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (C) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
other than solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates will be indemnified hereunder.

 

(d) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Loss or a claim or demand hereunder that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall deliver a Claim Notice in
respect thereof to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness
after becoming aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and shall provide
the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this _Article IX_.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.9_, each
Indemnifying Party hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any
court in which an Action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against
any Indemnified Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may
have under this Agreement with respect to such Action or the matters alleged
therein and agrees that process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with
respect to such claim anywhere.

 

Section 9.5 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (other than _Article VII_ ): (a) an
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ for any Losses relating to or arising out of any
individual event, matter or occurrence, or series of related events, matters
or occurrences, unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds
$50,000 (and any such Losses relating to or arising out of any individual
event, matter or occurrence, or series of related events, matters or
occurrences for an amount less than or equal to $50,000 shall not be
considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement and shall be excluded from
the calculation of Losses for purposes of determining whether or not Losses
exceeding the Deductible has occurred for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_,
but the amount of any Losses relating to or arising out of any individual
event, matter or occurrence, or series of related events, matters or
occurrences for an amount greater than $50,000 shall be considered Losses for
their full amount), (b) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_, _Section_
__ _ 9.2(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ unless and until the aggregate
amount of indemnifiable Losses for claims which may be recovered from
the Indemnifying Party under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _
9.2(b)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable

 



66  only for the amount of such Losses in excess thereof, and (c) the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an
Indemnifying Party arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(iii)(C)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)(i)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_
shall be an amount equal to $25,000,000, _provided_ , that the foregoing
clauses (a)-(c) shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the
inaccuracy or breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation, any Seller
Fundamental Representation, any Company Fundamental Representation, the first
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.12_ (Title to Assets) or _Section_ __ _ 4.15_
(Taxes), or to any claim for Fraud. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
9.5_, the amount of indemnifiable Losses recovered by the Buyer with respect
to any distribution of Indemnity Escrow Shares to the Buyer from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be deemed to equal (x) the Price Per Share multiplied by
(y) the number of Indemnity Escrow Shares distributed to the Buyer from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund. The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article
IX_ shall be determined net of (i) any net Tax benefit actually realized
(including as the result of any refund, deduction or credit) by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates as a result of such Losses in the
year of the applicable Loss or in the following year and (ii) any insurance
or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification, less any costs incurred to recover such amounts and any
increase in premiums resulting from such claim.

Section 9.6 _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge_.
If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Buyer expressly
reserves the right to seek indemnification for any Losses arising out of or
relating to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
herein, notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or
imputed knowledge of the Buyer or any of its Representatives in respect of any
fact or circumstance that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether
before or after the execution and delivery hereof. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Sellers agree that knowledge or lack of reliance shall not be a
defense in law or equity to any claim of any breach by the Sellers or the
Company of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Sellers or the
Company herein.

Section 9.7 _Materiality Qualifications_. Both for purposes of determining
breach and for calculating the amount of any Loss arising from a breach of
any representation or warranty subject to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)(i)_ (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 4.6_, _4.7(b)_ , _5.10_ and _5.11_
), all "material," "materially," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse
Effect," and other like qualifications shall be disregarded (including any
such qualification included in any schedule, certificate or other document
delivered pursuant hereto and in any representations or warranties subject to
any such schedule, certificate or other document).

Section 9.8 _Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) The Indemnity Escrow Shares shall be the sole and exclusive source of
recovery for the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to the Sellers
indemnification obligations under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(iii)(C)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)(i)_,
other than with respect to claims for Losses as a result of, arising out of
or relating to a breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations, the Company
Fundamental Representations or the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.12_
(Title to Assets) or to any claim for Fraud. To the extent that a Seller is

 



67  required to make an indemnification payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5_
or this _Article IX_ , the first method of satisfaction of such payment, and
the initial recourse to recover for such indemnification payment, shall be
the release of Indemnity Escrow Shares in the Indemnity Escrow Fund in the
manner provided in this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ and the Escrow Agreement; and
then, to the extent any amounts remain owing (subject to the limitations
contained in this _Article IX_ ), such amounts shall be payable directly by
the applicable Seller in cash. The Indemnity Escrow Shares to be deposited
into the Indemnity Escrow Fund will be issued in the names of the Sellers,
whether in book-entry or certificated form, with each Seller being issued such
Sellers Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Escrow Shares. Whenever any
disbursement of Indemnity Escrow Shares is made, such disbursement shall be
comprised of Indemnity Escrow Shares registered in the name of the Seller that
is required to satisfy an indemnity obligation or entitled to take receipt of
such Indemnity Escrow Shares, as applicable, and in each case pursuant to
this  _Article IX_ and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, no fractional Buyer Common Shares shall be disbursed from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, and, to the extent that any such fractional security
would be required to be so disbursed but for this sentence, such fractional
security shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number of the
applicable securities.2

 

(b) Anything in this _Article IX_ to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights
and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any and
all Tax matters shall be governed by _Article VII_ to the extent this _Article
IX_ is inconsistent with _Article VII_.

 

Section 9.9 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any
Indemnified Party may have the right to assert claims for indemnification
under or in respect of more than one provision of this Agreement in respect of
any fact, event, condition or circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover the amount of any Losses suffered by such Person more
than once, regardless of whether such Losses may be as a result of a breach
of more than one representation or warranty or covenant. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, any item included in the calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Transaction Expenses or Closing Indebtedness, in
each case, that resulted in an actual reduction to the Purchase Price or was
otherwise accrued as a specific payable, reserve or expense on the Closing
Balance Sheet shall not, to the extent of such reduction or accrual, form the
basis for a claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

Section 9.10 _Exclusive Remedy; Waiver_.

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF THE CLOSING
OCCURS AND EXCEPT (I) AS PROVIDED IN THIS  _ARTICLE IX_ OR (II) IN THE CASE
OF FRAUD, NO PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY, AND NO PARTY SHALL MAKE ANY
CLAIM, FOR ANY LOSS OR OTHER MATTER (AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT OF
CONTRIBUTION AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES), UNDER,
ARISING

portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

76 Section 11.19 _Role of Vinson_ __ _ and Elkins L.L.P.; Waiver of Conflicts and
Privilege_.

manager of any Seller or the Company (any such Person, a "
_Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, by any legal counsel (including Vinson and
Elkins L.L.P.) currently representing the Company in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements (the "
_Current Representation_ ").

(c) The parties agree that, following the Closing, with respect to any
communication between any legal counsel (including Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.) or
other advisor, on the one hand, and any Seller, the Company or any Designated

expectation of client confidence shall be exclusively vested in and belong to,
and may controlled exclusively by, the Sellers and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Buyer or the Company. Accordingly, following the Closing, (i)
the Buyer and the Company will not have access to any such communications or
the files of any such legal counsel or other advisor relating to the Current
Representation, (ii) to the extent such files constitute property of
the client during the Current Representation, only the Sellers (and not the
Company) shall hold such property rights, (iii) such legal counsel or other
advisor shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such Privileged
Communications to Buyer or the Company by reason of any Post-Closing
Representation, (iv) Sellers may use the Privileged Communications in any
dispute that relates in any way to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including in any claim for
indemnification brought by the Buyer or its Representatives) and (v) neither
the Buyer nor the Company may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any action against or involving any of the parties or seek
to obtain such communications (whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege or through other means). The Buyer waives and will not
assert, and agrees to cause the Company to waive and to not assert, any
attorney-client privilege in connection with any Post-Closing Representation
relating to the Current Representation, including in connection with a dispute
with the Buyer and, following the Closing, with the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises after Closing between Buyer
or the Company, on the one hand, and a third party (other than a party to this
Agreement), on the other hand, the Company may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of Privileged Communications by counsel to
such third party; _provided_ _that_ the Company may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative.

The Buyer and the Sellers Representative hereby agree that:



     | (a) | the Buyer shall be entitled to, through the release of the

the Buyer of amounts in respect of the Cash Portion (as defined below) (the
Escrowed Shares and the Cash Portion together, the " _Escrowed Share Amount_
"), any amounts that the Buyer is entitled to recover from the Sellers
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement provided such amounts are mutually agreed
to or finally determined in accordance with the Purchase Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if the Buyer is entitled to recover any portion of the
Escrowed Share Amount in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, then the

Escrowed Share Amount or any part thereof in accordance with the provisions
of the Purchase Agreement shall also be entitled to the interest earned on the

The Escrow Agent shall not, by reason of its execution of this Agreement,
assume or be deemed to have assumed any responsibility or liability for any
transactions between the other Parties other than for the performance of its

this Agreement. The Party on whose behalf, or pursuant to whose direction,

its partners, associates, officers, directors, employees and agents from and
against any and all claims, demands, losses, penalties, costs, expenses, fees
and liabilities, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses,
directly or indirectly, sustained or incurred by the Escrow Agent as a result
of the taking of such action, except where such action or omission involves
the wilful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith of the Escrow Agent, and
in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and any act done or omitted by it
pursuant to the advice of any legal counsel it may employ shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith. This indemnity shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.



   6.3 | Duties of Escrow Agent 
---|--- 

The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except as expressly
provided in this Agreement and shall not be obligated to recognize, nor have
any liability or responsibility arising under, any other agreement to which

notwithstanding that reference thereto may be made herein.



   6.4 | Responsibilities of Escrow Agent

sufficiency, genuineness or validity of any property deposited with the Escrow

     | (b) | The Escrow Agent may, acting reasonably, rely upon any
instrument in writing believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine and
sufficient and properly presented in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
---|---|---

costs associated therewith will be borne one-half by the Buyer, on the one
hand, and one-half by the Sellers Representative, on the other hand. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | In case any property held by the Escrow Agent hereunder
shall be attached, garnisheed or levied upon under any order of a court or the
delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by any order of any court or any
other order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court
affecting such property or any part thereof, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized in its sole discretion to obey and comply with all writs,
orders, final judgments or decrees so entered or issued and in case the
Escrow Agent complies with any such writ, order, final judgment or decree the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the other Parties, their heirs,
executors, legal representatives, successors or assigns or to any other
person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance. 
---|---|--- 



   6.5 | Replacement of Escrow Agent 
---|--- 

The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from all further duties and
liabilities hereunder by giving to the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
60-days advance notice in writing which resignation will take effect on the
appointment of, and acceptance by, a successor in accordance with this
Agreement. In the event of the Escrow Agent resigning as aforesaid, a
replacement escrow agent shall be appointed by the other Parties jointly and
failing such appointment the retiring Escrow Agent may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction on such notice as such justice may direct, for the
appointment of a new escrow agent. Any escrow agent appointed in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall be vested with the same powers, rights,
duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named herein as
escrow agent, without any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed, and the
expression "Escrow Agent" herein shall include such replacement escrow agent.
If a new escrow agent is appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
new Escrow Agent will be entitled to receive a reasonable fee for its
services, which may be different from the fees payable to the retiring Escrow
Agent, as may be approved by such court or agreed by the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative. At the time of appointment of the successor escrow
agent, the Escrow Agent will deliver the Escrowed Share Amount to such
successor.

 



   6.6 | No Agency or Trust Relationship 
---|--- 

The Buyer and the Sellers Representative acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is
acting solely at their request and for their convenience and the Escrow Agent
shall not be deemed to be the agent or trustee of any Party in respect of the
escrow herein referred to, and the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are
purely mechanical in nature and shall not give rise to any fiduciary
obligation to any Party.

 



\- 9 - ---|--- 

The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith except where such action or omission involves the
wilful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent may act pursuant to the advice of counsel with respect to any
matter relating to this Agreement and will not be liable for any action taken
or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such advice.



   6.8 | Limitation of Responsibility 
---|--- 

The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to know or determine the performance or
non-performance of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement
except as expressly required or contemplated in the performance by the Escrow
Agent of the functions contemplated to be performed by it under this
Agreement. The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent are limited to
those expressly stated herein. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ are
not intended to and shall not restrict or remove any other rights which the
Escrow Agent may have at law or in equity to seek relief or direction a court
of competent jurisdiction in addition to such as are expressly set forth
herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Escrow Agent is
hereby authorized to disregard any and all notices or other communication,
other than written notices given by any of the other Parties, and is hereby
expressly authorized to comply with any and all processes, orders, judgments
or decrees of any court of competent jurisdiction and shall not be liable to
any of the other Parties for such compliance. If the Escrow Agent complies
with any such process, order, judgment or decrees of any court, it shall not
be liable to any of the other Parties for compliance, notwithstanding any
such process, order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside, or vacated, or being subsequently found to have been
issued or entered without jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall be under no
duty or obligation to ascertain the identity, authority, or rights of the
Parties (or their agents) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or
deliver this Agreement, or any instruments, documents, or papers related
hereto or funds deposited or called for hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not
be liable for any reasonable error of judgment or any act or omission or any
mistake or fact or law.

 



   6.9 | Dispute 
---|--- 

In the event of any conflicting demands or claims with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to
discontinue all further acts until such conflicts are resolved, and the
further right to commence or defend any action or proceeding for the
determination of such conflict, including, without limitation of the
foregoing, a suit or action in interpleader. In the event that the Escrow
Agent should commence any action to determine any such conflict between the
Parties, including but not limited to an action in the nature of an
interpleader, the Escrow Agent shall, upon deposit of the Escrowed Share
Amount held hereunder with a court of competent jurisdiction, be _ipso facto_
released and discharged from any and all duties and obligations imposed upon
the Escrow Agent hereunder with respect to the subject matter of such action.

connection with this Agreement, for or to the credit of such Party, either (i)
is not intended to be used by or on behalf of any third party or (ii) is
intended to be used by or on behalf of a third party in which case such third
party will complete and execute forthwith a declaration in the Escrow Agents

ARTICLE II

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

_Section 2.1_ _Shelf Registration_.

 

(a) _Shelf Registration_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, but in
no event more than 30 days following the Closing Date, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file a Shelf Registration
Statement under the Securities Act covering the Registrable Securities. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Shelf Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable
after the date of filing of such Shelf Registration Statement (the "Filing
Date"). The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_
to be continuously effective under the Securities Act until the earliest of
(i) all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement
have been distributed in the manner set forth and as contemplated in such
Shelf Registration Statement, (ii) there are no longer any Registrable
Securities outstanding or (iii) three years from the Effective Date (the
"Effectiveness Period"). A Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ shall be on such appropriate registration form of
the Commission as shall be selected by the Company; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Company is a WKSI at the time a Shelf Registration Statement is
required to be filed hereunder, such Shelf Registration Statement shall be
filed as an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement. A Shelf Registration
Statement when declared effective (including the documents incorporated
therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (and, in the case of any prospectus
contained in such Shelf Registration Statement, in the light of the
circumstances under which a statement is made). As soon as practicable
following the date that

 



4  a Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_ becomes effective, but in any event within five Business Days of such
date, the Company shall provide the Holders with written notice of the
effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement; provided that no such notice
shall be required if such Shelf Registration Statement is an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement.

 

(b) _Resale Registration Opt-Out_. Any Holder may deliver advance written
notice (a "Resale Opt-Out Notice") to the Company requesting that such Holder
not be included in a Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)_. Following receipt of a Resale Opt-Out Notice from a Holder,
the Company shall not be required to include the Registrable Securities of
such Holder in such Shelf Registration Statement.

 

(c) _Failure to Become Effective_. If a Shelf Registration Statement required
by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ does not become or is not declared effective
within 120 days after the Filing Date (the "Target Effective Date"), then the
Holders shall be entitled to a payment (with respect to each of the Holders
Registrable Securities which are included in such Shelf Registration
Statement), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, (i) for each non-
overlapping 30-day period for the first 60 days following the Target
Effective Date, an amount equal to (A) 0.25% times (B) the product of (x) the
Purchased Share Price times (y) the number of Registrable Securities, then
held by such Holder and included on such Shelf Registration Statement (such
product of (x) and (y) being the "Liquidated Damages Multiplier"), and (ii)
for each non-overlapping 30-day period beginning on the 61st day following
the Target Effective Date, with such payment amount increasing by an
additional amount equal to 0.25% times the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per
non-overlapping 30-day period for each subsequent 60 days (i.e., 0.5% for
61-120 days, 0.75% for 121-180 days, and 1.0% thereafter) up to a maximum
amount equal to 1.0% times the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per non-
overlapping 30-day period (the "Liquidated Damages"), until such time as the
Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective or there are no longer any
Registrable Securities outstanding. The Liquidated Damages shall accrue on a
daily basis and be paid to the Sellers in cash within ten Business Days of the
end of such 30-day period. Any Liquidated Damages shall be paid to the
Sellers in immediately available funds. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ shall relieve the Company from its obligations
under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_.

(d) _Waiver of Liquidated Damages_. If the Company is unable to cause a Shelf
Registration Statement to become effective by the Target Effective Date as a
result of an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar
transaction, then the Company may request a waiver of the Liquidated
Damages, which may be granted by the consent of the majority of Holders that
have been included on such Shelf Registration Statement, in their sole
discretion, and which such waiver shall apply to all the Holders included on
such Shelf Registration Statement.

(e) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company may delay the filing of a Shelf Registration Statement required
by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ and may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder
whose Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement,
suspend such Selling Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of the
Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall
discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement) if (i) the 

 



5  Company is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or
other similar transaction and the Company determines in good faith that the
Companys ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be
materially and adversely affected by any required disclosure of such
transaction in the Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) the Company has
experienced some other material non-public event the disclosure of which at
such time, in the good faith judgment of the Company, would materially and
adversely affect the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Selling Holders be suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Shelf Registration Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of
60 days in any 180 day period. Upon disclosure of such information or the
termination of the condition described above, the Company shall provide
prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are included
in the Shelf Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any
suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other actions
necessary or appropriate to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities
as contemplated in this Agreement.

 

 _Section 2.2_ _Piggyback Registration_.

 

(a) _Participation_. If the Company proposes to file (A) a registration
statement under the Securities Act providing for the public offering of
Common Stock, for its own account or for the account of a selling stockholder,
for sale to the public in an Underwritten Offering, excluding a registration
statement on Form S-4 or Form S-8 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any
successor forms thereto), a registration statement for the sale of Common
Stock issued upon conversion of debt securities or any other form not
available for registering the Registrable Securities for sale to the public,
or (B) a prospectus supplement to an effective Shelf Registration Statement,
so long as the Company is a WKSI at such time or, whether or not the Company
is a WKSI, so long as the Registrable Securities were previously included in
the underlying Shelf Registration Statement, then, in each case with respect
to an Underwritten Offering of Common Stock, the Company will notify each
Holder of the proposed filing and afford each Holder an opportunity to
include in such Underwritten Offering all or any part of the Registrable
Securities then held by such Holder (the "Included Registrable Securities")
that may properly be offered on such registration statement (a "Piggyback
Registration"). Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that the fact
that such a notice has been delivered shall constitute confidential
information and such Holder agrees not to disclose that such notice has been
delivered or effect any public sale or distribution of Common Stock until the
earlier of (i) the date that the applicable registration statement or
prospectus supplement has been filed with the Commission and (ii) 20 days
after the date of such notice. Each Holder desiring to include in such
Piggyback Registration all or part of such Registrable Securities held by such
Holder that may be included in such Piggyback Registration shall, within three
Business Days after receipt of the above-described notice from the Company in
the case of a filing of a registration statement and within two Business Days
after the day of receipt of the above-described notice from the Company in the
case of a filing of a prospectus supplement to an effective Shelf
Registration Statement with respect to a Piggyback Registration, so notify the
Company in writing, and in such notice shall inform the Company of the number
of shares of Registrable Securities such Holder wishes to include in such
Piggyback Registration and provide the Company with such information with
respect to such Holder as shall be reasonably necessary in order to assure
compliance with federal and applicable state securities Laws. If no request
for inclusion from a Holder is received within the time period specified in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, such Holder shall have

 



6  no further right to participate in such Piggyback Registration. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to register any
Registrable Securities upon the request of any Holder pursuant to a Piggyback
Registration, or to permit the related prospectus or prospectus supplement to
be used, in connection with any offering or transfer of Registrable Securities
by a Holder other than pursuant to an Underwritten Offering. If, at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten
Offering and prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, the Company
shall determine for any reason not to undertake or to delay such Underwritten
Offering, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to the Selling Holders and (x) in the case of a determination
not to undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of its
obligation to sell any Included Registrable Securities in connection with
such terminated Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case of a determination
to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any
Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in the
Underwritten Offering. Any Holder may deliver written notice (a "Piggyback
Opt-Out Notice") to the Company requesting that such Holder not receive notice
from the Company of any proposed Underwritten Offering; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Holder may later revoke any such Piggyback Opt-Out
Notice in writing. Following receipt of a Piggyback Opt-Out Notice from a
Holder (unless subsequently revoked), the Company shall not be required to
deliver any notice to such Holder pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ and
such Holder shall no longer be entitled to participate in Underwritten
Offerings by the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_.

(b)  _Priority of Piggyback Registration_. If the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering of shares of Common Stock
included in a Piggyback Registration advise the Company that the total shares
of Common Stock which the Selling Holders and any other Persons intend to
include in such offering exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering
without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of Common Stock offered or the market for the Common Stock, then
the Common Stock to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall include
the number of shares of Common Stock that such Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters advise the Company can be sold without having such adverse
effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to the Company and (ii)
second, pro rata among the Selling Holders and any other Persons who have been
or are granted registration rights on or after the date of this
Agreement (the "Other Holders") who have requested participation in the
Piggyback Registration (based, for each such Selling Holder or Other Holder,
on the percentage derived by dividing (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
proposed to be sold by such Selling Holder or such Other Holder in such
offering; by (B) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be
sold by all Selling Holders and all Other Holders in the Piggyback
Registration).

 

(c) _General Procedures_. In connection with any Underwritten Offering, the
Company shall be entitled to select the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters.
In connection with an Underwritten Offering contemplated by this Agreement in
which a Selling Holder participates, each Selling Holder shall be obligated to
enter into an underwriting agreement with the Managing Underwriter
or Underwriters which contains such representations, covenants, indemnities
and other rights and obligations as are customary in underwriting agreements
for firm commitment offerings of equity securities. No Selling Holder may
participate in such Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder agrees
to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting
agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires,

 



7  powers of attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably required
under the terms of such underwriting agreement. No Selling Holder shall be
required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the
Company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Selling Holder and its ownership of the securities
being registered on its behalf and its intended method of distribution and
any other representation required by Law. If any Selling Holder disapproves of
the terms of an Underwritten Offering, such Selling Holder may elect to
withdraw therefrom by notice to the Company and the Managing Underwriter; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that such withdrawal must be made at least one
Business Day prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering to be
effective. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall affect the Companys
obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

_Section 2.3_ _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations under
this _Article II_ , the Company will, as promptly as practicable:

(a) subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, prepare and file with the Commission
such amendments and supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement and the
prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep a Shelf
Registration Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and as may be
necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to
the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration
Statement;

 

(b) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a Shelf Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or
amendment thereto (other than any amendment or supplement resulting from the
filing of a document incorporated by reference therein), upon request, copies
of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed to be filed
(excluding exhibits and any document incorporated by reference therein), and
provide each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to any information
pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is
contained therein and make the corrections reasonably requested by such
Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to filing such Shelf
Registration Statement or such other registration statement and the
prospectus included therein or any such supplement or amendment thereto, and
(ii) such number of copies of such Shelf Registration Statement or such other
registration statement and the prospectus included therein and any such
supplements and amendments thereto as such Persons may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable
Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement or any other
registration statement;

 

(c) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement
or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders shall
reasonably request, provided that the Company will not be required to
qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction where it is not
then required to so qualify or to take any action which would subject it to
general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so
subject;

 



8 (d) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i)
the filing of a Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus included therein or
any amendment or supplement thereto (other than any amendment or supplement
resulting from the filing of a document incorporated by reference therein),
and, with respect to such Shelf Registration Statement or any other
registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, in each case
other than an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, when the same has become
effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written comments from the Commission
with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any written request
by the Commission for amendments or supplements to such Shelf Registration
Statement or any other registration statement or any prospectus or prospectus
supplement thereto;

 

(e) immediately notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i)
the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus contained in a
Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated
by this Agreement or any supplemental amendment thereto, includes an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; (ii) the issuance
or threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of any proceedings
for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Company of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable
Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any
jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice but subject to _Section_
__ _ 2.1(e)_, the Company agrees to as promptly as practicable amend or
supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate
action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and to take such
other action as is necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat
thereof or proceedings related thereto;

(f) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months,
beginning with the first full calendar month after the Effective Date of such
registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions
of Section l1(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

(g) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Selling Holders
access to such information and the Company personnel as is reasonable and
customary to enable such parties and their representatives to establish a due
diligence defense under the Securities Act; provided that the Company need not
disclose any non-public information to any such representative unless and
until the Selling Holders and such representatives have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Company;

 

(h) use all commercially reasonable efforts to procure customary legal
opinions and auditor "comfort" letters in connection with the sale of
Registrable Securities by any Selling Holder utilizing the Shelf Registration
Statement;

 



9 (i) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then
listed;

(j) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(k) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement not later than the Effective Date; and

(l) if reasonably requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as such
Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale
and distribution of Registrable Securities by such Selling Holder, including
information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities being offered
or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the
offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; and (ii)
make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment.

 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Company of the happening
of any event of the kind described in subsection (e) of this _Section_ __ _
2.3_, shall forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities
until such Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended prospectus contemplated by subsection (e) of this _Section_ __ _
2.3_ or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so
directed by the Company, such Selling Holder will deliver to the Company (at
the Companys expense) all copies in its possession or control, other than
permanent file copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of
the prospectus and any prospectus supplement covering such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

 

 _Section 2.4_ _Cooperation by Holders_. The Company shall have no obligation
to include Registrable Securities of a Holder in the Shelf Registration
Statement or in an Underwritten Offering under _Article II_ of this Agreement
if such Selling Holder has failed to timely furnish such information which, in
the opinion of counsel to the Company, is reasonably required in order for
the registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to comply
with the Securities Act.

_Section 2.5_  _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of_ _Registrable_
_Securities_. Regardless of whether a Holder elects to include shares of
Common Stock that constitute Registrable Securities in an Underwritten
Offering, each Holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees that it shall
not, to the extent requested by the Company or an underwriter of securities of
the Company, directly or indirectly sell, offer to sell (including any short
sale or hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a
sale), grant any option or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Registrable
Securities or other securities of the Company or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock of the Company

 



10  then owned by such Holder during the period beginning 14 days prior to the
expected date of "pricing" of such offering and continuing for a period not to
exceed 90 days following the effective date of a registration statement for
an Underwritten Offering or the date of a prospectus supplement filed with the
Commission with respect to the pricing of an Underwritten Offering, other than
the sale or distribution of shares of Common Stock that constitute
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such period shall in no event be greater than that which applies to
executive officers and directors of the Company. In order to enforce the
foregoing covenant, the Company shall have the right to impose stop transfer
instructions with respect to the Registrable Securities and such other
securities of each Holder (and the securities of every other Person subject to
the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period.

_Section 2.6_ _Expenses_.

 

(a) _Certain Definitions_. "Registration Expenses" means all expenses incident
to the Companys performance under or compliance with this Agreement to
effect the registration of Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ or a Piggyback Registration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, and the disposition of such securities,
including, without limitation, all registration, filing, securities exchange
listing and NASDAQ fees, all registration, filing, qualification and other
fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, fees of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, including, transfer taxes and fees of
transfer agents and registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses, the fees and disbursements of counsel and independent
public accountants for the Company, including the expenses of any special
audits or "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance
and compliance. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_,
the Company shall not be responsible for legal fees incurred by Holders in
connection with the exercise of such Holders rights hereunder. In addition,
the Company shall not be responsible for any "Selling Expenses," which
means all underwriting fees, discounts and selling commissions and transfer
taxes allocable to the sale of the Registrable Securities.

(b)  _Expenses_. The Company will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses in
connection with a Shelf Registration Statement or a Piggyback Registration,
whether or not any sale is made pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement
or Piggyback Registration. Each Selling Holder shall pay all Selling Expenses
in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder.

 

 _Section 2.7_ _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _By the Company_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its
directors, officers, employees, agents and managers, and each Person, if any,
who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees, agents and
managers, against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, "Losses"),
joint or several, to which such Selling Holder or controlling Person may
become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise,
insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect 

 



11  thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact (in the case of any prospectus, in light
of the circumstances under which such statement is made) contained in the
Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated
by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein, or any free writing prospectus related thereto, or any amendment or
supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and
will reimburse each such Selling Holder, its directors and officers and each
such controlling Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions
or proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not be liable
in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder or such controlling Person in writing expressly for inclusion
in the Shelf Registration Statement or such other registration statement, or
prospectus supplement, as applicable.

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees to, severally and
not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers,
employees and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of the Securities Act or of the Exchange Act to the same extent
as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Selling Holders, but only
with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing
by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in the Shelf
Registration Statement or prospectus supplement relating to the Registrable
Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto.

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to any indemnified party other than under this _Section_ __
_ 2.7(c)_ except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. In any action brought against any indemnified
party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and
undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified party under this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_ for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of
liaison with counsel so selected; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) if the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (ii)
if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have
concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified
party that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably
may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then
the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and
to assume such legal

 



12  defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the
reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable
expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying
party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
indemnifying party shall not settle any indemnified claim without the consent
of the indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability
or obligation on, includes a complete release from liability of, and does not
contain any admission of wrong doing by, the indemnified party.

 

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _
2.7_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to the Company or any Selling Holder or is insufficient to hold
them harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on
the one hand and of such Selling Holder on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the
one hand and each Selling Holder on the other shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has
been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph
were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph. The amount paid by an
indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence
of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any Loss which is the subject of this paragraph. No Person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall
be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which
an indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 

 _Section 2.8_ _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Company to register Registrable Securities granted to the Sellers
by the Company under this _Article II_ may be transferred or assigned by each
Seller only to one or more transferee(s) or assignee(s) of such Registrable
Securities who are Affiliates of such Seller. The Company shall be given
written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and
address of each such transferee and identifying the securities with respect to
which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and each
such transferee shall assume in writing responsibility for its obligations of
such Seller under this Agreement.

 

 _Section 2.9_ _Aggregation of_ _Registrable_ _Securities_. All Registrable
Securities held or acquired by Persons who are Affiliates of one another
shall be aggregated together for the purpose of determining the availability
of any rights under this Agreement.
