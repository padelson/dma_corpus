AGREEMENT 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE 1 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

  

    1.1 _ The Offer. _ 

  

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE 7_ , as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days) after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares at the Offer Price. The consummation of the Offer, and the obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall be subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer (in the aggregate) and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares that, together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned by the Purchaser, equals at least a majority of the Shares then issued and outstanding (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. The conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ are for the sole benefit of the Purchaser and may be asserted by the Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be waived to the extent permitted by applicable Law by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, subject to this _Section 1.1_. 

  

 (b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_, the Purchaser shall accept for payment (the time of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable following the Expiration Date, and, in any event, no more than three (3) Business Days after the Expiration Date. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Purchaser expressly reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to 

  

      

  

increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that except with the prior
written approval of the Company, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the
Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
(iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer,
(iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of the other
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ in a manner adverse to the
holders of Shares, (vi) impose conditions to the Offer that are in addition
to the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ hereto, (vii) except as
provided in _Section 1.1(e) and 1.1(f)_, terminate, accelerate, extend or
otherwise modify or amend the Expiration Date, or (viii) otherwise modify
or amend any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any
material respect to the holders of Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall any waiver by the Parent or the Purchaser of any condition to the
Offer (other than the Minimum Condition) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to be a modification or amendment of the Offer that is
adverse to the holders of Shares.

  

 (d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 12:00 midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such date and time, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

  

 (e) If on any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_) have not been satisfied or waived by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer for successive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if on the Initial Outside Date the only then unsatisfied or non-waived condition (excluding the Minimum Condition) is the HSR Condition, the Purchaser shall not be required to extend, and shall not extend without the written consent of the Company, the Offer beyond the Extended Outside Date; and (ii) except as provided in clause (i) above, if on the Initial Outside Date any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied, the Purchaser shall not be required to extend, and shall not extend without the written consent of the Company, the Offer beyond the Initial Outside Date; _provided_ , _further,_  that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer (x) for more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate after the Company delivers or is required to deliver to the Purchaser a notice, in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_, that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative has received a Competing Proposal, or (y) if the Company has delivered to the Purchaser a Notice of Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_,  until the second Business Day after the conclusion of the four (4) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period contemplated by _Section 5.3(d)_, except to the extent that prior to the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day, four (4) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, the Company Board has rejected the Competing Proposal giving rise to such notice (including any material changes, developments or modifications to such Competing Proposal) and reconfirmed the Company Board Recommendation, which rejection of such Competing Proposal and reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation has been publicly announced by the Company in the event that the Competing Proposal had previously been made public. In addition, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff. 

  

 (f) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE 7_. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE 7_ , 

  

      

  

the Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days following such termination),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause
the Purchaser to) promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on
behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof and the Purchaser shall
not (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser not to) accept any Shares
pursuant to the Offer.

  

 (g) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Purchaser may, but shall not be required to, provide guaranteed delivery procedures for the tender of Shares in the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Purchaser provides guaranteed delivery procedures, for purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, the Parent and the Purchaser shall include for purposes of its determination thereof Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures if and only if Shares subject to such guarantees have been received by, or on behalf of, the Purchaser as of the Expiration Date. The Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by federal securities Laws, including the Exchange Act. The Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly notify the other party and correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, the Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Parent and the Purchaser or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such responses and the Parent and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. 

  

  

    
 1.2 _ Company Actions. _ 

  

  

 (a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14d-9 thereunder, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.3_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in customary form, and a notice, in compliance with Section 251(h) and Section 262 of the DGCL, of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the DGCL. The Company shall set the Stockholder List Date as the record date for purposes of receiving the notice required by 

  

      

  

Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation.
The Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. To the
extent requested by the Purchaser, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9
to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares together with
the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares. The Parent and the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to
promptly notify the other party and correct any information included in, or
incorporated by reference into, the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that
it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by federal
securities Laws, including the Exchange Act. The Purchaser and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before
it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Purchaser
and its counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide the Purchaser and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any
oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
any such written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Purchaser
and its counsel.

   

 (b) From time to time as requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such information (including updated lists of holders of the Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial holders of Shares. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate with the Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Equity Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer. Subject to any and all Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, the Parent and the Purchaser and their agents shall: (i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and listings, computer files or files of securities positions in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE 7_ , the Parent and the Purchaser shall, at the Company\'s request, either, in the Parent\'s sole discretion, (1) destroy any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or control (and if requested by the Company, certify in writing to such destruction) or (2) deliver (and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver) to, the Company any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or control.

ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

   

    2.1 _ Conversion of Securities. _ At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, the
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

 (a) _ Conversion of Company Shares._ Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares irrevocably accepted for payment in the Offer and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

  

 (b) _ Purchaser Equity Interests._ All outstanding Equity Interests of the Purchaser held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become (in the aggregate) one hundred (100) shares of newly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

    
 2.2 _ Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall designate a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). The Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or promptly after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the payments contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.1_, the Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make such payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively. Earnings from such 

  

      

  

investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Purchaser, and no
part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

   

 (b) _ Procedures for Surrender._ 

    

 (i) _ Certificates._ As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as the Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Purchaser, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. 

   

 (ii) _ Book-Entry Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior 

   

      

   

to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held
through The Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall
be in such form as the Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree;
and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal,
in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for
Book-Entry Shares representing Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders, which
shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value
of such Shares in accordance with and to the extend provided by Section 262 of
the DGCL.

    

 (c) _ Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability._ Any portion of the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, in respect of such holder\'s surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (e) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a); provided_, _however_ , that the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in 

  

      

  

a reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

    
 2.3 _ Dissenting Shares. _ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. The Company shall give the Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

    
 2.4 _ Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Treatment of Options._ Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") under any stock option or other equity or equity-based plan of the Company, including the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "), whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "). No holder of a Company Option that, as of immediately prior to such cancellation, has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such cancelled Company Option. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment, if any. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall make, by a payroll payment through the Company\'s or the Purchaser\'s payroll provider and subject to withholding, if any, as described in _Section 2.5_ to each holder of Company Options, such holder\'s Option Payment. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (b) _ Treatment of Restricted Stock Units._ Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit with respect to the Shares (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") under any Company Equity Plan, whether or not then vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company RSU shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company RSU and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "). On or as soon as practicable following the Closing, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall make, by a payroll payment through the Company\'s or the Purchaser\'s payroll provider and subject to withholding, if any, as described in _Section 2.5_ below to each holder of Company RSUs, such holder\'s RSU Payment. 

  

 (c) _ Termination of Company Equity Plans._ As of the Effective Time, all Company Equity Plans and the ESPP shall be terminated and no further Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Equity Interests or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder. 

  

 (d) _ Board Actions._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including obtaining any required consents) to effect the transactions described in this _Section 2.4._

  

  

    
 2.5 _ Withholding Rights. _ The Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts that the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

    
 2.6 _ Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. _ As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary resolution, to (a) terminate the Company\'s Amended and Restated 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, (b) ensure that no Offering (as defined in the ESPP) shall be commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (c) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the Offering in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause a new Purchase Date (as defined in the ESPP) to be set under the ESPP, which date shall be the Business Day immediately prior to the anticipated Closing Date, (d) prohibit participants in the ESPP from altering their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the ESPP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP), and (e) provide that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase Company Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP (as amended pursuant to this _Section 2.6_) be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time without interest.

Agreement and only, in each case, as and to the extent disclosed therein
(other than disclosures in any exhibits or schedules thereto or in any

the context in which such disclosure is made that such disclosure shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection of this
Agreement, the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Parent and the
Purchaser as follows:

   

    
 3.1 _ Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. _ 

  

  

 (a) The Company and each of its "significant subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act) (each, a " _Significant Subsidiary_ ") is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to the Purchaser true and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") not filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC, (ii) any amendments to the Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") not filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC and (iii) the certificates of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Significant Subsidiary. The Company is in compliance with the terms of the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, and the Significant Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with their respective organizational or governing documents. 

  

 (c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for each Company Subsidiary, as applicable: (A) its true and complete name and jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, and (B) the record owner(s) of its outstanding shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests. All Equity Interests in each Company Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, non-assessable (to the extent applicable) and not in violation of preemptive rights and are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Except for Equity Interests of the Company Subsidiaries or as otherwise set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any Equity Interest of any Person (including the Company), or has any obligation or has made any binding commitment, in each case to a Third Party, to acquire any such Equity Interest, or to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person. 

  

  

    
 3.2 _ Capitalization. _ 

  

  

 (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 34,000,000 Company Shares, of which, as of the close of business on November 14, 2014 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), there were 

  

      

  

17,075,394 Company Shares issued and outstanding and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Preferred Stock_ "), of which no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued
and outstanding. The Company does not hold any Company Shares in treasury. No
Company Subsidiary owns any Company Shares or has any option or warrant to
purchase Company Shares or any other Equity Interest in the Company. All of
the outstanding Company Shares have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. No
outstanding Company Shares are subject to forfeiture restrictions, repurchase
rights or other restrictions under the Company Equity Plans.

  

 (b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has no Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock subject to or reserved for issuance, except for (i) 50,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement, (ii) 1,911,349 Company Shares subject to outstanding Company Options under the Company Equity Plans, (iii) 691,100 Company Shares subject to outstanding Company RSUs under the Company Equity Plans, (iv) 287,153 Company Shares reserved for future issuance under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan for awards not yet granted, and (v) 1,106,437 Company Shares reserved for future issuance under the ESPP. All shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Shares subject to issuance under the Company Rights Agreement or Company Equity Plans or the ESPP, as the case may be, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. 

   

 (c) _Section 3.2(e)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list, as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, of (A) each holder of Company Options, (B) the number of Company Options held by each such holder, (C) the number of Company Shares subject to each such Company Option (i.e., the original amount less exercises and any forfeitures), and (D) the exercise price and expiration date of each such Company Option. _Section 3.2(e)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list, as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, of (v) each holder of Company RSUs, (w) the number of Company RSUs held by each such holder, (x) the number of Company Shares subject to each such Company RSU (i.e., the original amount less any forfeitures), and (y) the expiration date of each such Company RSU. All Company Options and Company RSUs are evidenced by stock option or restricted stock unit agreements, forms of which have been made available to the Parent, and no stock option agreement or restricted stock unit agreement contains any terms that are inconsistent with or in addition to such forms in any material respect. Each Company Option and each Company RSU may, by its terms, be treated as set forth in _Section 2.4_. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. 

  

 (d) Each grant of a Company Option was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan, the Securities Act and all other applicable Laws. The per-share exercise price of each Company Option was not less than the fair market value of a Company Share on the date on which the grant of such Company Option was by its terms to be effective (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan and, to the extent applicable, Sections 409A and 422 of the Code). 

  

 (e) Except for Equity Interests set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_, the Company Rights outstanding under the Company Rights Agreement and the Company Options and Company RSUs set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_, there are no outstanding Equity Interests or other options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character issued by the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to or based on the value of any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, acquire or sell any Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. From the close of 

  

      

  

business on the Capitalization Date until the date of this Agreement, the
Company has not issued any Company Shares, Company Options and Company RSUs or
other Equity Interests other than Company Shares issued upon the exercise of
any Company Options or settlement of Company RSUs outstanding as of the close
of business on the Capitalization Date in accordance with their terms or in

All income and other material Taxes due and payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid in full or are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established and maintained in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, other than automatic extensions of time not requiring the consent of any Governmental Entity. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of all income Tax Returns of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the last three taxable years. No written claim that could give rise to Taxes has been made to the Company or any Company Subsidiary within the previous six years by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns. 

  

 (b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries did not, as of the dates of the financial statements, materially exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in the financial statements.

statements. There are no current or pending, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, audits, examinations, assessments, inquiries, or other
Proceedings or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigations for or

Entities with respect to Taxes other than matters that have been disclosed

Subsidiaries. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to an income or other material Tax assessment
or deficiency which waiver has not expired or been terminated. No closing
agreements, private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda or similar
agreements or rulings have been sought from, entered into or issued by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary within the previous six years that could increase the amount of
Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 (d) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under _Section 5.3(c)_ unless (i) the Company has not breached this  _Section 5.3_ (unless such breach was _de minimis_ in nature and did not adversely affect the Parent or the Purchaser or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) as it relates to such Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company has provided written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to the Purchaser that the Company intends to take such action, which notice includes an unredacted copy of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (including the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal and any equity or debt financing materials related thereto, if any), provided, if the proposed Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company is in response to an Intervening Event, then such notice shall include, in lieu thereof, a summary, in all material respects, of the Intervening Event, (iii) during the four (4) Business Day period following the Purchaser\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, negotiate with the Purchaser in good faith (to the extent the Purchaser desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or, with respect to an Intervening Event, as would permit the Company Board (consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law) to not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iv) following the end of the four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by the Purchaser in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or, as applicable, with respect to the Intervening Event, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal or any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, as applicable, shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this sentence, references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period. 

  

 (e) From and after the date hereof, until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE 7_ , the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours), notify the Purchaser in the event that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative receives (i) any Competing Proposal or statement by any Person that it is planning or intends to submit a Competing Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than requests for information that could not reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal. The Company shall notify the Purchaser (orally and in writing) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of the identity of such Person and provide a copy of such Competing Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of such Competing Proposal, indication, inquiry or request). The Company shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed (orally and in writing) promptly (and in any event at the Purchaser\'s request and otherwise no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of any material changes or material developments) of the status of any Competing Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto), including furnishing the Purchaser with copies of any material written 

  

      

  

inquiries, material correspondence and draft documentation related thereto
exchanged between the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and Company
Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making a Competing Proposal
and their representatives, on the other hand.

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through the Company Representatives, from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law with respect to a Competing Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company\'s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure permitted under  _Section 5.3(f)(i)_ shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change unless it includes either an express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (g) The Company agrees that any violation by any of the Company Subsidiaries or any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the Company. 

  

 (h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 (ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event or development or material change in circumstances (including any acceleration or deceleration of existing changes to the extent of such acceleration or deceleration) first occurring or arising (or first becoming known to the Company) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, to the extent that such event, development or change in circumstances (A) is disproportionately more favorable to the business, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, when compared to other Persons operating in the same industries in the same geographic markets as the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (B) was not reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the following events, developments or changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening Event: (1) the receipt, existence or terms of a Competing Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (2) any events, developments or changes in circumstances relating to the Parent or the Purchaser or any of their affiliates, (3) the actual or potential sale of the Company\'s Connected business, including the purchase price or other terms and conditions thereof, or (4) changes in the market price or trading volume of Company Shares or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the underlying causes of such change or fact shall not be excluded by this clause (4). 

   

    

   

   

                                    

   

   

 (iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Competing Proposal (except the references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "85%") made by a Third Party which was not solicited or obtained in violation of _Section 5.3(a)_ and which, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, and after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account the various legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Competing Proposal, including the financing terms thereof, the expected timing and risk and likelihood of consummation, and the Third Party making such Competing Proposal (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger (after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms thereof which may be proposed by the Purchaser (including pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_)). 

   

  

    
 5.4 _ Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings. _ 

  

  

 (a) The Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) take such actions as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (iii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries in order to effect the Closing by not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Extended Outside Date, and to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with the HSR Act) that would prevent effecting the Closing by not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Extended Outside Date or delay the Closing beyond two (2) Business Days prior to the Extended Outside Date, in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iv)(A) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof), make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith (such fees to be paid by Parent and the Purchaser), with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under the HSR Act, and (B) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under other applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and any Other Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings.

consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to
obtain any Third Party consent described in the first sentence of this
_Section 5.4(b)_ such party shall take any such actions reasonably requested
by the other party hereto (at such other party\'s sole cost and expense), to
minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and the Parent, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which would
reasonably be expected to result, after the Acceptance Time or the Effective

 (c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section 5.4_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, Investigation, action or Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, Investigation, action or Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

fact(s), change(s), event(s), development(s) or circumstance(s) that have
occurred, arisen or come into existence or first become known to any party,
that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of
any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, (b) the failure of the
Company or the Purchaser and/or the Parent, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or

covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise modify the
conditions to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder.

 5.7 _ Indemnification of Directors and Officers. _ 

  

  

 (a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and the Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless all the past and present directors or officers of the Company and of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ") as provided by the terms of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement, in each case, arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether or not asserted prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), to the full extent permissible under the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Surviving Corporation and the Parent shall advance 

  

      

  

expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the
defense of any Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters subject
to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.7(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Covered Person to whom expenses
are advanced shall, prior to such advancement, undertake to repay such
advanced expenses to the Surviving Corporation, if it is ultimately determined
by a final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification.

  

 (b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of Covered Persons for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. Following the Effective Time, the indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors or officers of the Company shall continue in full force and effect with respect to matters arising out of acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the Company\'s directors and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company\'s existing policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided to the Purchaser) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, which premium the Company represents and warrants to be approximately $231,000. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

  

 (d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_. 

  

 (e) The obligations under this _Section 5.7_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns) without the consent of such affected indemnitee (or their respective successors and assigns) (it being expressly agreed that the Covered Persons (including successors and assigns) shall be Third Party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_). 

  

  

    
 5.8 _ Takeover Statutes. _ If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, the Parent or the Purchaser, the Offer, the Merger or the Support Agreements or any other 

         

transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company
Board shall use commercially reasonable efforts to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

  

    
 5.9 _ Section 16 Matters. _ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a "covered person" of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs pursuant to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\. 

  

    
 5.10 _ Rule 14d-10(d) Matters. _ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, from and after the date hereof and until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE 7_ , enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case, to any current or former director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (each member of which the Company Board shall have determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of NASDAQ Equity Rule 5605(a)(2) and shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

    
 5.11 _ Transaction Litigation. _ The Company shall control, and the Company shall give the Purchaser the opportunity to participate in the defense of, any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company or any other Person against the Company and/or members of the Company Board relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger (collectively, " _Transaction Litigation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation, or consent to the same, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In connection with any Transaction Litigation and the Company\'s performance of its obligations under this _Section 5.11_, the Parties shall enter into a customary common interest or joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques as reasonably required to preserve any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide information if doing so, in the opinion of the Company\'s legal counsel, would cause the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if any information is withheld pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall inform the Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable the Company to provide such information without causing the loss of any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege. 

  

    
 5.12 _ Stock Exchange De-listing. _ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with the Purchaser and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Shares from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date. 

       

                                    

    

    
 5.13 _ Obligations of the Purchaser. _ The Parent will take all actions necessary to cause the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 (a) During the period from the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, subject to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement or employment agreement, the Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Person who is employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time who continues in the employment of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") compensation and benefits (including severance benefits) that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that no equity-based change in control, retention or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits provided immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be taken into account for these purposes. 

  

 (b) The Continuing Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the Parent (to the extent a Continuing Employee is brought under any such plan), the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries under which each Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under comparable Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or require the funding of any such benefit. 

  

 (c) To the extent that, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation changes the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements in which Continuing Employees participate, the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee to the same extent waived under a comparable Benefit Plan, and (ii) with respect to the plan year in which the change was made, provide a credit to each Continuing Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employee under the Benefit Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that nothing in this _Section 5.14_ or otherwise contained in this Agreement is intended to or does or shall constitute an amendment to or establishment of any employee benefit or other plan or, subject to the express provisions of _Sections 5.14(a)_,  _(b)_ , and _(c)_ , shall prevent the amendment or termination of any such plan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee to any Continuing Employee of (i) employment or (ii) without limiting the express provisions of provisions of _Sections 5.14(a)_, _(b)_ , and _(c)_ , any specific term or condition of employment. The provisions of this _Section 5.14_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any union or collective bargaining representative thereof), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and 

  

      

  

assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement.

  

 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in all cases prior to the Closing Date), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall complete the works council and trade union notifications and consultations they are required by applicable Laws to have completed prior to the Closing Date in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and their respective effects and shall have complied with all other notification, consultation and similar obligations (whether statutory or contractual) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries required to be complied with by them prior to the Closing Date in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and their respective effects. Prior to distribution of any correspondence or other documentation with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any of their respective effects to any of their employees or any works council, trade union or similar employee representative body, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide the Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered in good faith by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries).

 8.6 _ Headings. _ The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

    
 8.7 _ Severability. _ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if _Section 5.3_ or the Termination Fee is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any rule of Law or public policy, then the parties agree the remainder of this Agreement shall be unenforceable (it being understood that the validity, legality and enforceability of _Section 5.3_ and the Termination Fee are essential to the parties and a material inducement to the entering into of this Agreement by the parties, and not severable pursuant to this _Section 8.7_). Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

    
 8.8 _ Entire Agreement. _ This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended hereby) constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements (except the Confidentiality Agreement, as amended hereby) and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   

    
 8.9 _ Assignment. _ This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties, _provided_ that the Parent or the Purchaser may assign any of their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Parent without the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve the Parent or the Purchaser, as the case may be, of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 8.9_ shall be null and void. 

   

    
 8.10 _ No Third Party Beneficiaries. _ This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than (a) pursuant to _Section 5.7_ , (b) if the Closing occurs, the right of the holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration, (c) if the Closing occurs, the right of holders of Company Options to receive their respective Option Payments and (d) if the Closing occurs, the right of the holders of Company RSUs to receive their respective RSU Payments, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto, and consequently, may not accurately characterize actual facts or circumstances. 

  

    
 8.11 _ Non-Recourse. _ Except for any Proceeding arising under or related to any Support Agreement, any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein. Except for any liability or obligation arising under or related to any Support Agreement, no former, current or future direct or indirect equityholders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, members, managers, agents, trustees, affiliates, general or limited partners or assignees of the parties hereto (except permitted assignees under _Section 8.9_) or of any former, current or future direct or indirect equityholder, controlling Person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member, manager, agent, trustee, affiliate, general or limited 

        

partner or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, but for the
avoidance of doubt excluding the parties hereto) will have any liability or
obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto or for any Proceeding based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or failure to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby), in each case whether
based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise.

  

    
 8.12 _ Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. _ Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including" and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. The schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all purposes. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or article in which such words appear. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. 

  

    
 8.13 _ Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury. _ 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by any other party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or Federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.13_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of 

  

      

  

execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the
Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue
of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.13_ and
agrees that service made in such manner shall have the same legal force and
effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.13(c)_. 

  

  

    
 8.14 _ Counterparts. _ This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

  

    
 8.15 _ Specific Performance. _ The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any state or Federal Court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, without necessity of posting bond or other security (any requirements therefor being expressly waived).
