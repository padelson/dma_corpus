Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of the Company
into Merger Sub on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") not owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will immediately
following the execution of this Agreement approve this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, subject to Section 6.12 hereof, for Federal income tax purposes it
is intended that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection

Merger, the payment of cash in connection with the Merger, the issuance by
Parent of shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Parent ("
_Parent Common Stock_ ") in connection with the Merger (the " _Share
Issuance_ ") and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Transactions_."

  



  

## Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger
shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 650 Town Center

on the second Business Day following the satisfaction (or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by

  

##      
   

## 

  

## their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be agreed in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_."

  



  

## Section 1.03 _Effective Time_.  Prior to the Closing, Parent shall
prepare, and on the Closing Date, the Surviving Entity shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other
appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with such Secretary of State on the Closing Date, or at such later
time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_
").

  



  

## Section 1.04 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided herein and in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL.

  



  

## Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by the DGCL or applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (b) The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter

the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Entity, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

## Section 1.07 _Officers_ **.** The officers of the Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Entity, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until

CERTIFICATES**

## Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_.  At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares

Entity.

  



  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
(or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub)
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash, Parent Common Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

### (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

  



  

#### (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(b), 2.01(d) and 2.02(e), each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock outstanding prior to the Effective

##### (i) for each such share of Company Common Stock with respect to which
an election to receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been
effectively made, and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.03 (each, an
" _Electing Share_ "), the right to receive (subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 2.01(e)) 0.3247 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), including the associated
special stock purchase rights issued (" _Parent Rights_ ") pursuant to the
Rights Agreement dated as of October 6, 1996 between Parent and the Bank of
New York, as Rights Agent (the " _Parent Rights Agreement_ "); and

  



  

##### (ii) for each such share of Company Common Stock other than Electing
Shares (each, a " _Non-Electing Share_ ") the right to receive (subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 2.01(e)) $17.75 in cash, without interest
(the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and each stockholder of the Company that
holds Non-Electing Shares shall be deemed to have made a cash election (a "
_Cash Election_ ") with respect to such Non-Electing Shares.

  

##### 

  

#### (2) The cash payable, and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued, upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to

#### contemplated by Section 2.02(e), are referred to collectively as "
_Merger Consideration_." As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
2.02, without interest.

  

#### 

  

#### (3) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record
date within said period, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly
adjusted.

  

#### 

  

### (d) _Dissenter Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Dissenter Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment for
such Dissenter Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Sections 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenter Rights_ ") shall not be converted
into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c)(1), but rather
the holders of Dissenter Shares shall be entitled to payment for such
Dissenter Shares in accordance with the Dissenter Rights; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment under the Dissenter
Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid in accordance with the
Dissenter Rights shall cease and such Dissenter Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c)(1). The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any written notice of intent to demand payment, or any written
demand for payment, received by the Company in respect of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

### (e) _Proration_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary:

  



  

#### (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted
into the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(1) shall be equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y)
0.6642 (the " _Stock Cap_ "), and all other shares of Company Common Stock
shall be converted into the Cash Consideration.

  

#### 

  

#### (2) if the aggregate number of Electing Shares exceeds the Stock Cap,
then (x) all Non-Electing Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (y) the Electing Shares
of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Electing Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Electing Shares held by

  



  

4      
   



  

#### such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Cap
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Electing Shares, with
the remaining number of such holders Electing Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and

  

#### 

  

#### (3) if the aggregate number of Electing Shares is less than the Stock
Cap (the amount by which the aggregate number of Electing Shares is less than
the Stock Cap being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then
(x) all Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and (y) the Non-Electing Shares of each holder thereof
will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Non-Electing Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the number of Non-Electing Shares held by such holder by
(B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, with the
remaining number of such holders Non-Electing Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

## Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement and in any event not less than three days prior to dissemination of
the Joint Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company and the
stockholders of Parent, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall
also act as the agent for the Companys stockholders for the purpose of
receiving and holding their Forms of Election and Certificates and shall
obtain no rights or interests in such shares. Promptly following the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Article II, through the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and (ii) the amount of cash
consideration payable, in each case, pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in exchange
for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the
purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash
in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.02(e). The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver Parent Common
Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 out of the Exchange
Fund. The Exchange Fund may not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) who did not complete an Form of
Election pursuant to Section 2.03, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as

  



  

5      
   



  

### Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash, if any,
and the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  Thereafter,
such holder shall be treated as a holder of Parent Common Stock for purposes
of voting or quorum for any meeting of the stockholders of Parent. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c).  No interest shall be paid
or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

### (c) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date on
or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Certificate
formerly representing Company Common Stock with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid and/or issued in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been paid and/or issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however,
to the Surviving Entitys obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this

  



  

6      
   



  

### Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid
at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity
of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  



  

### (e) _No Fractional Shares_.

  

### 

  

#### (1) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent
Common Stock.  For purposes of this Section 2.02(e), all fractional shares
to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated
and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

  

#### 

  

#### (2) In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be
entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent,
equal to the product of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled under Section
2.01(c) (or would be entitled but for this Section 2.02(e)) and (B) an amount
equal to the average of the closing sale prices for Parent Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in The Wall Street Journal,
Northeastern edition, for each of the ten consecutive trading days ending
with the second complete trading day prior to the Effective Time.

  

#### 

  

### (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Entity for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration (including any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) and any applicable dividends or
distributions with respect to any Parent Common Stock constituting Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.02(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon.

  



  

### (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or
any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such cash, shares, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

7      
   



  

### (h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in direct
obligations of the U.S. Treasury or otherwise with the consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent.

  



  

### (i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority, the Surviving Entity will be treated as
though it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock, sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market
value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such
cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

  



  

### (j) _Income Tax Treatment_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.  Subject to any revision to the structure of the transaction as
provided under Section 6.12(c) hereof, the parties hereto hereby adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meanings of
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the U.S.  Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code.

  



  

## Section 2.03 _Elections_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date referred to in
paragraph (b) below, is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled, with respect to all or any portion of such shares, to make
an unconditional Stock Election on or prior to such Election Date, on the
basis hereinafter set forth.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent shall prepare a form of election, which form shall be subject
to the reasonable approval of the Company (the " _Form of Election_ ") and
shall be mailed with the Joint Proxy Statement to the record holders of
Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting), which Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who wishes to elect to receive the stock
consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(1) for any or all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder. The Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to make the Form of Election and the Joint Proxy Statement available
to all persons who become record holders of Company Common Stock during the
period between such record date and the Election Date, including using
reasonable efforts to mail a Form of Election to all such persons who become
record holders prior to the seventh Business Day prior to the Election Date.
Any such holders election to receive the stock consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01(c)(1) shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., Pacific Standard
Time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Election Date_ "), a Form of Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by Certificates for the shares of Company Common Stock to which
such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in

  



  

8      
   



  

### blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the
Company (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm which is a
member of a registered national securities exchange or of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company
having an office or correspondent in the United States, provided such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three New
York Stock Exchange trading days after the date of execution of such
guarantee of delivery). Failure to deliver Certificates covered by any
guarantee of delivery within three New York Stock Exchange trading days after
the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery shall be deemed
to invalidate any otherwise properly made Stock Election. Parent and the
Company will announce the anticipated Closing Date at least three Business
Days, but not more than ten Business Days, prior thereto. If the Closing is
delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Date shall be similarly delayed
and Parent will promptly announce such rescheduled Election Date and Closing.

  



  

### (c) Any Form of Election may be revoked by the stockholder who submitted
such Form of Election to the Exchange Agent only by written notice received
by the Exchange Agent (i) prior to 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Election
Date or (ii) after such time, if (and only to the extent that) the Exchange
Agent is legally required to permit revocations and only if the Effective
Time shall not have occurred prior to such date. In addition, all Forms of
Election shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in
writing by Parent and the Company that the Merger has been abandoned. If a
Form of Election is revoked, the Certificate or Certificates (or guarantees
of delivery, as appropriate) for the shares of Company Common Stock to which
such Form of Election relates shall be promptly returned to the stockholder
submitting the same to the Exchange Agent and any such shares shall be
treated as Non-Electing Shares (unless and until another duly completed
Form of Election (and the Certificate or Certificates, or guarantees of
delivery, as applicable, to which such Form of Election relates) has been
submitted to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Agreement).

  

### 

  

### (d) The determination of the Exchange Agent in its sole discretion shall
be binding as to whether or not elections to receive the stock consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(1) have been properly made or revoked pursuant to
this Section 2.03 with respect to shares of Company Common Stock and when
elections and revocations were received by it. If no Form of Election
is received with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, or if the
Exchange Agent determines that any election to receive the stock
consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(1) was not properly made with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock, such shares shall be treated by
the Exchange Agent as Non-Electing Shares at the Effective Time, and such
shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.01(c)(1)(ii) (subject to Section 2.01(e)). The
Exchange Agent shall also make all computations as to the proration
contemplated by Section 2.01(e), and absent manifest error any such
computation shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock.  The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual agreement of
Parent and the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section
2.03 for the implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be
necessary or desirable fully to effect such elections.

## Section 2.04 _Company Equity Awards_.

  

## 

  

### (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option then outstanding
under any Company Stock Plan, whether or not then exercisable, shall be
assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Common
Stock in accordance with this Section 2.04(a). Each Company Stock Option so
converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (acknowledging that the Company Stock Plans (other than the 1998
Independent Director Stock Option Plan) provide for accelerated vesting in
connection with this Transaction) as set forth in the applicable Company
Stock Plan and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each unvested Company Stock
Option under the 1998 Independent Director Stock Option Plan shall be fully
vested and exercisable, (ii) each Company Stock Option shall be exercisable
for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (without regard to any adjustment
provided in Section 2.01(e)), rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock
Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company
Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the conversion of any Company Stock Options which are "incentive
stock options," within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, into options
to purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made so as not to constitute a
"modification" of such Company Stock Options within the meaning of Section
424 of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding purchase right under the
Companys Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Employee
Stock Purchase Plan_ ") shall be assumed by Parent in such manner that Parent
is a corporation "issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to
which Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning of the Code, and shall be
converted into a right to purchase Parent Common Stock in accordance with
this Section 2.04(b). Each purchase right so assumed and converted by Parent
under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions set forth in the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
the documents governing the outstanding purchase rights under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the
purchase price of shares of Parent Common Stock and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of such purchase rights
shall be adjusted in accordance with the Exchange Ratio.

  

### 

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, each RSU shall vest according to its terms and
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be issued to each holder of RSUs, in complete settlement thereof, a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (net of any applicable withholding) equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to RSUs
credited to the holders account immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (without regard to any adjustment provided
in Section 2.01(e)), such product to be rounded to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

10      
   



  

### (d) At the Effective Time, the forfeiture conditions on each Performance
Award shall lapse according to its terms and, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be issued to each holder
of a Performance Award, in complete settlement thereof, a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (net of any applicable withholding) equal to the product
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon achievement of
all performance goals set forth in the holders Performance Award multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio (without regard to any adjustment provided in Section
2.01(e)), such product to be rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company
Supplemental Retention Plan as of the Effective Time. In connection with
such termination, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be issued to each participant in the Supplemental
Retention Plan, in complete settlement of such participants rights with
respect to Supplemental Retention Units, a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (net of any applicable withholding) equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Supplemental Retention Units
credited to such participants account immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (without regard to any adjustment
provided in Section 2.01(e)), such product to be rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (f) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise or settlement of the Company Equity Awards being assumed or
settled in accordance with this Section 2.04. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Company Equity Awards and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as the Company Stock Options being assumed in accordance
with this Section 2.04 remain outstanding.

other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since

### 

  

### (b) As of its respective date, each Company SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities

such Company SEC Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the
extent that information contained in any Filed Company SEC Document has been
revised or superseded by a later filed Filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements
of the Company included in the Company

  



  

15      
   



  

### SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments). The books and records of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements.

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the
Companys most recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto) included in the
Filed Company SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any Liabilities of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes thereto,
except for Liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (d) None of the Company Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January
1, 2001 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and

to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent
in connection with the Share Issuance (the " _Form S-4_ ") will, at the time
the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented
or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first
mailed to the Companys stockholders or Parents stockholders or at the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

  



  

## Section 3.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31,
2003, the Company has conducted its business in all material respects only in
the ordinary course, and since such date there has not been:

  



  

16      
   



  

##### (i) any event or development, condition or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) any change in accounting methods, principles or practices by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, except insofar as may have been required
by a change in GAAP; or

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) any material elections with respect to Taxes by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or settlement or compromise by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of any material Tax Liability or refund.

  

##### 

  

## Section 3.09 _Taxes_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Except with respect to any divestitures that may be undertaken
pursuant to Section 6.03(a), none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
any Company affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Except with respect to any divestitures
that may be undertaken pursuant to Section 6.03(a ), to the
Companys knowledge, there is no agreement, plan or other circumstance that
would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries timely have filed with the
appropriate Tax authority or other Governmental Authority all material Tax
Returns required to be filed, taking into account any extensions of time
within which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns are complete
and accurate in all material respects, subject to such exceptions as would
not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have paid all Taxes (other than such
Taxes as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for
which adequate reserves have been taken) that have become due, whether or not
shown on any Tax Return, subject to such exceptions as are unlikely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries did not, as of the dates of the financial
statements contained in the most recent Company SEC Documents, exceed the
reserve for Tax Liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than in any notes thereto)
contained in such financial statements, subject to such exceptions as are
unlikely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of the
financial statements in the most recent Company SEC Documents, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any Liability for Taxes
outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with past
custom and practice, subject to such exceptions as would not be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (c) There are no audits or other administrative proceedings or court
proceedings currently pending or in progress with regard to any material
Taxes or material Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received a written notice
or announcement of any audits or other administrative proceedings or court
proceedings, subject to exceptions for any audits or

  



  

17      
   



  

### proceedings that, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, are unlikely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has granted any
waivers or extensions of the time to assess any Taxes.

  

### 

  

### (d) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary except Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable
and Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, subject to such exceptions as would not be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (e) All Taxes required to be withheld, collected or deposited by or with
respect to the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been timely withheld,
collected or deposited as the case may be, and to the extent required by
applicable Law, have been paid to the relevant Tax authority or other
Governmental Entity, subject to such exceptions as are unlikely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is responsible for the
Taxes of any other person (other than the Company or a Company Subsidiary)
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local, or foreign Law), as a transferee or by Contract that would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, is bound by or has any
obligation under any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnity agreement
or similar Contract or arrangement, subject to such exceptions as would not
be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a party to
any distribution occurring during the two (2) years preceding the date of
this Agreement in which the parties to such distribution treated the
distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code is applicable.

  

### 

  

### (h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has entered into or
participated in any listed transaction within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or any confidential corporate tax shelter
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.6111-2.

  

### 

  

## Section 3.10 _Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans_. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, since
December 31, 2003, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
terminated, adopted, amended, modified or agreed to amend or modify (or
announced an intention to amend or modify) any collective bargaining
agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock appreciation,
restricted stock, stock option, phantom stock, performance, retirement,
thrift, savings, stock bonus, cafeteria, paid time off, perquisite, fringe
benefit, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization,
medical or other welfare benefit or other plan, program, arrangement or
understanding, whether oral or written, formal or informal, funded or
unfunded (whether or not legally binding) maintained, contributed to or
required to be maintained or contributed to by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any other person or entity that, together with the Company or
any

  



  

18      
   



  

## Company Subsidiary, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, a " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ "), in each
case providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer, director
or independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, a "
_Company Participant_ ") and whether or not subject to United States law
(collectively, " _Company Benefit Plans_ ") or has made any change in any
actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding obligations with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is a Company Pension Plan, or any
change in the manner in which contributions to any such Company Pension Plan
are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined, other than
changes made pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party.

  



  

## Section 3.11 _ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of
all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")) ("
_Company Pension Plans_ "), "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other material Company Benefit Plans
maintained, or contributed to, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
the benefit of any Company Participant. Each Company Benefit Plan (other
than Company Multiemployer Pension Plans), and, to the knowledge of the
Company, each Company Multiemployer Pension Plan has been administered in
material compliance with its terms and applicable Law, and the terms of any
applicable collective bargaining agreements. The Company has delivered or
made available, or will as soon as practicable following the date hereof
deliver or make available, to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (i)
each Company Benefit Plan required to be listed on Section 3.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit
Plans, written descriptions thereof), (ii) the two most recent annual reports
required to be filed, or such similar reports, statements,
information returns or material correspondence filed with or delivered to any
Governmental Entity, with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (including
reports filed on Form 5500 with accompanying schedules and attachments),
(iii) the most recent summary plan description prepared for each Company
Benefit Plan, (iv) each trust agreement and group annuity contract and other
documents relating to the funding or payment of benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan, (v) the most recent determination or qualification letter
issued by any Governmental Entity for each Company Benefit Plan intended to
qualify for favorable tax treatment, as well as a true, correct and complete
copy of each pending application for a determination letter, if applicable,
and (vi) the two most recent actuarial valuations for each Company Benefit
Plan.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each Company Benefit Plan (other than any Company Multiemployer
Pension Plan) intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code has been the subject of a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Benefit Plan is qualified and
exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has been revoked
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened, nor has
any such Company Benefit Plan (other than any Company Multiemployer Pension
Plan) been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its costs or require security under
Section 307 of ERISA.

  



  

19      
   



  

### (c) During the past six years neither the Company nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate has maintained, contributed to or been obligated to maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent Liability under, any Company
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, other than any Company
Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Company Multiemployer Pension Plan_ "). There have
been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions" (as such term is defined
in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of
fiduciary responsibility with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that
is subject to ERISA (other than any Company Multiemployer Pension Plan) and,
to the knowledge of the Company, with respect to any Company Multiemployer
Pension Plan that, in each case, could reasonably be expected to subject the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Company Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA,
or, to the knowledge of the Company, any trusts created thereunder or any
trustee or administrator thereof to the tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or to any material Liability
under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA or to any other material Liability
for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable Law. During
the six years prior to the date of this Agreement, no Company Pension Plan or
related trust has been terminated. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has incurred any material Liability that remains unsatisfied with
respect to a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms
are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) since
the effective date of such Sections 4203 and 4205 with respect to any
Company Multiemployer Pension Plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan, whether or not subject to ERISA, (i) no such Company Benefit
Plan is funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in
Section 419(e) of the Code), (ii) except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each such Company Benefit Plan
that is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1)
of the Code), complies with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f)
of the Code or any similar state statute, (iii) no such Company Benefit Plan
provides benefits after termination of employment, except where the cost
thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible dependents
or beneficiaries) or as required pursuant to any collective bargaining
agreement or by Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute and
(iv) Section 3.11(d)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Letter indicates whether
each welfare plan is self-insured or insured through third-party coverage.

  

### 

  

### (e) No amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in combination with any other
event) by any Company Participant who is an executive officer of the Company
who currently has in effect a change of control agreement or has
an employment agreement with change of control provisions under any
Company Benefit Plan or other compensation arrangement currently in effect
would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and no such executive officer is
entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company or any other
person in the event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the
Code is imposed on such executive officer.

  



  

20      
   



  

### (f) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not,
and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof
will not (either alone or in combination with any other event) (i) entitle
any Company Participant to any additional compensation, severance or other
benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any
breach or violation of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) under, any Company Benefit Plan.

  

### 

  

### (g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice of
any, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no (i) material pending
termination proceedings or other suits, claims (except claims for benefits
payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit Plans), actions or
proceedings against or involving or asserting any rights or claims to
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) pending investigations (other
than routine inquiries) by any Governmental Entity with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan. To the knowledge of the Company, all contributions,
premiums and benefit payments under or in connection with the Company Benefit
Plans that are required to have been made by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary have been timely made, accrued or reserved for in all material
respects.

  

### 

  

### (h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any material
Liability or obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit
Plan, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

## Section 3.12 _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, investigation
or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

## Section 3.13 _Compliance With Applicable Laws_. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their relevant personnel and operations are in compliance
with all applicable Laws, including applicable Gaming Laws and Laws relating
to occupational health and safety, except to the extent that the failure to
be in compliance with any such Law has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has received any written communication during the past
two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or a
Company Subsidiary is not in compliance with any applicable Law, except where
such non-compliance has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
and to the knowledge of the Company, each of their respective directors,
officers and persons performing management functions similar to officers,
have in effect all permits, findings of suitability, licenses, variances,
certificates of occupancy, exemptions, authorizations, operating
certificates, franchises, entitlements, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Entities (collectively, " _Permits_ "), necessary or advisable
for them

## to own, lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their
businesses as now conducted or proposed to be conducted, except for
such Permits the absence of which has not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  There has occurred no
violation of, suspension, reconsideration, imposition of penalties or fines,
imposition of additional conditions or requirements, default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, or event giving to others any right
of termination, amendment or cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, any such Permit, except for any such violation, default or
event which has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
suffered a suspension or revocation or imposition of penalties or fines with

### 

  

### (c) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on Parents
most recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto) included in the Filed
Company SEC Documents, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any
Liabilities of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet
of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, except
for Liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (d) None of Parent Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1,
2001 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d)
of the Exchange Act.

  

### 

  

## Section 4.07 _Information Supplied_.  None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any
time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to Parents stockholders or the
Companys stockholders or at the time of Parent Stockholders Meeting or the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is
made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by the Company in writing for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

  



  

## Section 4.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31,
2003, Parent has conducted its business in all material respects only in the
ordinary course, and since such date there has not been:

  



  

##### (i) any event or development, condition or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) any change in accounting methods, principles or practices by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, except insofar as may have been required by
a change in GAAP; or

  



  

31      
   



  

##### (iii) any material elections with respect to Taxes by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or settlement or compromise by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary of any material Tax Liability or refund.

  

##### 

  

## Section 4.09 _Taxes_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Except with respect to any divestitures that may be undertaken
pursuant to Section 6.03(a ), none of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any
Parent affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Except with respect to any divestitures that may
be undertaken pursuant to Section 6.03(a), to Parents knowledge, there is no
agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries timely have filed with the
appropriate Tax authority or other Governmental Entity all material Tax
Returns required to be filed, taking into account any extensions of time
within which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns are complete
and accurate in all material respects, subject to such exceptions as would
not be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries have paid all Taxes (other than such Taxes as are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been taken) that have become due, whether or not shown
on any Tax Return, subject to such exceptions as are unlikely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.  The unpaid Taxes of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries did not, as of the dates of the financial statements contained
in the most recent Parent SEC Documents, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance
sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in such financial
statements, subject to such exceptions as are unlikely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of the financial statements in the
most recent Parent SEC Documents, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business
or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice, subject to such
exceptions as would not be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (c) There are no audits or other administrative proceedings or court
proceedings currently pending or in progress with regard to any material
Taxes or material Tax Returns of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received a written notice or
announcement of any audits or other administrative proceedings or court
proceedings, subject to exceptions for any audits or proceedings that, if
resolved in a manner unfavorable to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, are
unlikely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary has granted any waivers or extensions of the time to assess
any Taxes.

  

### 

  

### (d) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary except Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and
Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, subject to such exceptions as would not be reasonably expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

32      
   



  

### (e) All Taxes required to be withheld, collected or deposited by or with
respect to Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have been timely withheld,
collected or deposited as the case may be, and to the extent required by
applicable Law, have been paid to the relevant Tax authority or other
Governmental Entity, subject to such exceptions as are unlikely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (f) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is responsible for the Taxes
of any other person (other than Parent or Parent Subsidiary) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or
foreign Law), as a transferee or by Contract that would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary is a party to, is bound by or has any obligation under any
Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnity agreement or similar Contract
or arrangement, subject to such exceptions as would not be reasonably
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (g) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been a party to any
distribution occurring during the two (2) years preceding the date of this
Agreement in which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution
as one to which Section 355 of the Code is applicable.

  

### 

  

### (h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has entered into or
participated in any listed transaction within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or any confidential corporate tax shelter
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.6111-2.

  

### 

  

## Section 4.10 _Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans_. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, since
December 31, 2003, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has terminated,
adopted, amended, modified or agreed to amend or modify (or announced an
intention to amend or modify) any collective bargaining agreement or any
bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock appreciation,
restricted stock, stock option, phantom stock, performance, retirement,
thrift, savings, stock bonus, cafeteria, paid time off, perquisite, fringe
benefit, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization,
medical or other welfare benefit or other plan, program, arrangement or
understanding, whether oral or written, formal or informal, funded or
unfunded (whether or not legally binding) maintained, contributed to or
required to be maintained or contributed to by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or any other person or entity that, together with Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code (each, a " _Parent ERISA Affiliate_ "), in each case
providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer, director or
independent contractor of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (each, a " _Parent
Participant_ ") and whether or not subject to United States law
(collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") or has made any change in any
actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding obligations with
respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is a Parent Pension Plan, or any
change in the manner in which contributions to any such Parent Pension Plan
are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined, other than
changes made pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement to which Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary is a party.

  



  

33      
   



  

## Section 4.11 _ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments_.

  

## 

  

### (a) All "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) (" _Parent Pension Plans_ "), "employee welfare benefit plans" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other material Parent Benefit Plans
maintained, or contributed to, by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for the
benefit of any Parent Participant (other than Parent Multiemployer Pension
Plans), and, to the knowledge of Parent, each Parent Multiemployer Pension
Plan, have been administered in material compliance with their terms and
applicable Law, and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreements.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each Parent Benefit Plan (other than any Parent Multiemployer Pension
Plan) intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code has been the subject of a determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service to the effect that such Parent Benefit Plan is qualified and exempt
from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of
the Code, and no such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Parent
Benefit Plan (other than any Parent Multiemployer Pension Plan) been amended
since the date of its most recent determination letter or application
therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its costs or require security under Section 307 of ERISA.

  

### 

  

### (c) During the past six years neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA
Affiliate has maintained, contributed to or been obligated to maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent Liability under, any Parent
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, other than any Parent
Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Parent Multiemployer Pension Plan_ "). There have
been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions" (as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of
fiduciary responsibility with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is
subject to ERISA (other than any Parent Multiemployer Pension Plan), and to
the knowledge of Parent, with respect to any Parent Multiemployer Pension
Plan, in each case, that could reasonably be expected to subject Parent, any
Parent Subsidiary or any officer of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of
Parent Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof
to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975
or to any material Liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA or to
any other material Liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any
other applicable Law. During the six years prior to the date of this
Agreement, no Parent Pension Plan or related trust has been terminated.
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has incurred any material Liability
that remains unsatisfied with respect to a "complete withdrawal" or a
"partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
respectively, of ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and
4205 with respect to any Parent Multiemployer Pension Plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan, whether or not subject to ERISA, (i) no such Parent Benefit
Plan is funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in
Section 419(e) of the Code), (ii) except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each such Parent Benefit Plan that
is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of
the Code), complies with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of
the Code or any

  



  

34      
   



  

### similar state statute and (iii) no such Parent Benefit Plan provides
benefits after termination of employment, except where the cost thereof is
borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible dependents or
beneficiaries) or as required pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement
or by Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute.

  

### 

  

### (e) No amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in combination with any other
event) by any Parent Participant who is an executive officer of Parent who
currently has in effect a change of control agreement or has an
employment agreement with change of control provisions under any Parent
Benefit Plan or other compensation arrangement currently in effect would be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and no such executive officer is entitled to
receive any additional payment from Parent or any other person in the event
that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on
such executive officer.

  

### 

  

### (f) The execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof
will not (either alone or in combination with any other event) (i) entitle
any Parent Participant to any additional compensation, severance or other
benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Parent Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any breach
or violation of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) under, any Parent Benefit Plan.

  

### 

  

### (g) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received notice of any,
and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no (i) material pending
termination proceedings or other suits, claims (except claims for benefits
payable in the normal operation of Parent Benefit Plans), actions or
proceedings against or involving or asserting any rights or claims to
benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan or (ii) pending investigations (other
than routine inquiries) by any Governmental Entity with respect to any Parent
Benefit Plan. To the knowledge of Parent, all contributions, premiums and
benefit payments under or in connection with Parent Benefit Plans that are
required to have been made by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary have been
timely made, accrued or reserved for in all material respects.

  

### 

  

### (h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any material Liability
or obligations, including under or on account of a Parent Benefit Plan,
arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary and treating such persons as consultants or independent
contractors and not as employees of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

## Section 4.12 _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, investigation
or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, has

nor is there any Judgment outstanding against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

## Section 4.13 _Compliance With Applicable Laws._ Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries and their relevant personnel and operations are in compliance
with all applicable Laws, including applicable Gaming Laws and Laws relating
to occupational health and safety, except to the extent that the failure to
be in compliance with any such Law has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has received any written communication during the past
two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Parent or a
Parent Subsidiary is not in compliance in any material respect with any
applicable Law, except where such non-compliance has not or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of their respective
directors, officers and persons performing management functions similar to
officers, have in effect all Permits, necessary or advisable for them to own,
lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses
as now conducted or proposed to be conducted, except for such Permits the
absence of which has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. There has occurred no violation of,
suspension, reconsideration, imposition of penalties or fines, imposition of
additional conditions or requirements, default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under, or event giving to others any right of
termination, amendment or cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, any such Permit, except for any such violation, default or
event which has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has suffered a suspension or revocation or imposition of penalties or fines
with respect to any Permit held under the Gaming Laws, other than in the
ordinary course. There is no event which, to the knowledge of Parent, would
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, cancellation, non-renewal
or adverse modification of any such Permit, except for any such event that
has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.13(a) does not
relate to matters with respect to Taxes (which are the subject of Section
4.09), ERISA (which are the subject of Section 4.11), labor Laws (which are
the subject of Section 4.16) or Environmental Laws (which are the subject
of Section 4.18).

  



  

## Section 4.14 _Assets Other Than Real Property Interests_. ** **Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries have good and valid title to all of their
respective material properties and assets, in each case free and clear of all
Liens, except (i) mechanics, carriers, workmens, repairmens or other like
Liens arising or incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to
obligations that are not delinquent or that are being contested in good faith
by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary and for which Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
has established adequate reserves, (ii) Liens for Taxes that are not due and
payable, are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or that
may thereafter be paid without interest or penalty, (iii) Liens that are
reflected as Liabilities on the balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2004 contained in the Filed Parent SEC Documents
and the existence of which is referred to in the notes to such balance sheet,
(iv) Liens arising under original purchase price conditional sales contracts
and equipment leases with third parties entered into in the ordinary course
of business and (v) other imperfections of title or encumbrances, if any,
that, individually or in the aggregate, do not materially impair, and would
not reasonably be expected materially to impair, the continued use and
operation of the assets to which they relate in the conduct of the business
of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries as presently conducted. This Section 4.14
does not relate to real property or interests in real property, such items
being the subject of Section 4.15, or to intellectual property, such items
being the subject of Section 4.19.

  



  

36      
   



  

## Section 4.15 _Real Property_. All real property and interests in
real property owned in fee by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (individually,
a " _Parent Owned Property_ ") and all real property and interests in real
property leased by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and any prime or
underlying leases relating thereto (individually, a " _Parent Leased
Property_ ") are set forth in the Form 10-K filed by Parent with the SEC for
the year ended December 31, 2003 or on Section 4.15 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter. Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has good and marketable fee
title to all Parent Owned Property and good and valid leasehold title to all
Parent Leased Property (a Parent Owned Property or Parent Leased Property
being sometimes referred to herein, individually, as a " _Parent Property_ "
and, collectively, the " _Parent Properties_ "), in each case subject only to
(i) Liens described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) of Section 4.14, (ii)
leases, subleases and similar agreements set forth in Section 4.15 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter and (iii) easements, covenants, rights-of-way and
other similar restrictions of record, if any, that, individually or in the
aggregate, do not materially impair, and would not reasonably be expected
materially to impair, the continued use and operation of the assets to which
they relate in the conduct of the business of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries
as presently conducted.  Any material reciprocal easements, operating
agreements, option agreements, rights of first refusal or rights of first
offer with respect to any Parent Property at which a casino or hotel project
is operated are set forth in Section 4.15 of the Parent Disclosure Letter.
There are no physical conditions or defects at any of the Parent Owned
Properties at which casino or hotel operations are conducted which materially
impair or would be reasonably expected to materially impair the continued
operation and conduct of the casino, hotel and related businesses as
presently conducted at each such Parent Owned Property.

  



  

## Section 4.16 _Labor Matters_. Since January 1, 2001, neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has experienced any labor strikes, or, to the
knowledge of Parent, union organization attempts, requests for
representation, work slowdowns or stoppages or other disputes due to labor
disagreements that would reasonably likely be material to any casino or hotel
operated or owned by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and, to the knowledge
of Parent, there is currently no such action threatened against or affecting
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Parent and Parent Subsidiaries are each in
compliance with all applicable Laws with respect to labor relations,
employment and employment practices, occupational safety and health
standards, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours, human rights,
pay equity and workers compensation, except to the extent that the failure to
be in compliance with any such Law has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries are not engaged in any unfair labor practice, and no unfair
labor practice charge or complaint against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened before the National Labor
Relations Board or any comparable Federal, state, provincial or foreign
agency or authority except for such practices, charges or complaints that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No grievance
or arbitration proceeding arising out of a collective bargaining agreement
is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to result in material
Liability to Parent.

  



  

## Section 4.17 _Contracts_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a
party to or bound by, as of the date hereof, any Contract that (i) is
a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC) or (ii) limits or otherwise restricts

  



  

37

competing in any line of business or in any geographic area.  Each Contract
of the type described in this Section 4.17, whether or not entered into as of
the date hereof and whether or not set forth in Section 4.17 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, is referred to herein as a " _Parent Contract_." Each
Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent or a Parent Subsidiary party
thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, and is in
full force and effect, and Parent and each of the Parent Subsidiaries have
performed all obligations required to be performed by them to the date hereof
under each Parent Contract and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party
to each Parent Contract has performed all obligations required to be
performed by it under such Parent Contract, except, in each case, as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or default
under (or any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of
notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any Parent Contract
or any other Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

or are validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all Intellectual
Property Rights used in the business of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary as of
the date hereof, other than such Intellectual Property Rights that are not

Material Adverse Effect on the validity or value of the Parent Intellectual
Property, (A) no written claim of invalidity or conflicting ownership rights

rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any of Parent Intellectual
Property or impair the right of the Company to make, use, sell, license or

Intellectual Property.

  



  

## Section 4.20 _Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses_. No broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other than Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent,

obtaining of all necessary approvals under any applicable Gaming Laws
required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions to be

### performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed
and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and other Transactions to be performed or consummated
by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
and its subsidiaries shall commit to any and all divestitures, licenses or
hold separate or similar arrangements with respect to its assets or conduct
of business arrangements as a condition to obtaining any and all approvals
from any Governmental Entity for any reason in order to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the Outside
Date, the Merger and the other Transactions to be performed or consummated by
Parent and its subsidiaries, including taking any and all actions necessary
in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent
or approval of the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "),
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ "), any authority enforcing applicable Gaming Laws, any
State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition
Law or regulation or relating to any Gaming Law, would preclude consummation
of the Merger by the Outside Date, unless any such action would, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of
this clause, after giving effect to the Merger). The Company shall agree if,
but solely if, requested by Parent to divest, hold separate or otherwise take
or commit to take any action with respect to the businesses, services, or
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in furtherance of this
Section 6.03; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such action may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and other
Transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, none of the parties hereto shall knowingly take
or cause to be taken any action which would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the satisfaction by the Outside Date of the
condition set forth in Section 7.01(d). Each of Parent and the Company
undertakes and agrees to file as soon as practicable a Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division and to
make such filings and apply for such approvals and consents as are required
under the Gaming Laws.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division or any authority enforcing applicable Gaming Laws for
additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests
received from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in
connection with antitrust matters or Gaming Laws, and (ii) not extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC or
the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### 

  

### (c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and the Company Board shall (x) take all reasonable action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure

  



  

50      
   



  

### that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the
other Transactions.

  

### 

  

### (d) In addition, each party shall, subject to applicable Law and except
as prohibited by any applicable representative of any applicable Governmental
Entity, (i) promptly notify the other party of any written communication to
that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General
or any other Governmental Entity, including regulatory or gaming authorities,
and, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondence, filings, and written communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and its
affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, including regulatory or gaming authority, or members or
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger.

  

### 

  

## Section 6.04 _Benefit Plans_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Subject to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement currently
in effect or which may be in effect in the future, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to maintain for a period of one year after the Effective
Time the Company Benefit Plans as in effect on the date of this Agreement as
set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter or to provide benefits (excluding
benefits attributable to equity-based plans or grants) to each current
employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are at least as
favorable in the aggregate to such employees as those in effect on the date
of this Agreement.  With respect to benefits attributable to equity-based
plans or grants, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
provide that each Company employee shall be eligible to receive grants in the
same manner as similarly situated employees of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in
effect on the date of this Agreement), all the Companys employment,
severance and termination agreements, plans and policies disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter.

  

### 

  

### (c) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including any severance plan),
for all purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting but
not for purposes of benefit accrual, service with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
affiliates (other than the Company) in which employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries

  



  

51      
   



  

### (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitation would have been applicable under the comparable Company
welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses
incurred by each Company employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the
relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

## Section 6.05 _Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the
Surviving Entity to honor all the Companys obligations to indemnify
(including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current or
former directors or officers of the Company for acts or omissions by such
directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent
that such obligations of the Company exist on the date of this Agreement,
whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company By-laws, individual
indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the
Merger. The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Entity shall
contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Entity to contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and exculpation of present and former directors and officers
of the Company than are presently set forth in the Company Charter and
Company By-laws.

  

### 

  

### (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make
annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (such 300% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided_ , 
_further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only
be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium,
Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and
officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium, _provided_ ,  _further_ , if the Company in its sole discretion
elects, by giving written notice to Parent at least 60 days prior to the
Effective Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, effective as of the
Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a directors and officers
liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a period of six
years after the Effective Time with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions
committed or allegedly committed at or prior to the Effective Time (such
coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy
in an amount not to exceed the annual aggregate coverage limit under the
Companys existing directors and officers liability policy, and in all other
respects shall be comparable to such existing coverage), provided that the
premium for such "tail" or "runoff" coverage shall not exceed an amount equal
to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents to Parent that the Maximum
Premium is as set forth in Section 6.05 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

52      
   



  

### (c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. The obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this Section 6.05 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 6.05 applies without the express written
consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this Section 6.05 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.05).

  

### 

  

## Section 6.06 _Fees and Expenses_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that expenses
incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

  

### 

  

### (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(e) or 8.01(f), then the Company shall pay to Parent, within two Business
Days following written notice of such termination in the case of termination
pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and concurrently with termination in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 8.01(f), in each case, by wire transfer of
same-day funds a fee of $180,000,000 (the " _Break-up Fee_ ").

  

### 

  

### (c) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, any person publicly
announces a Company Takeover Proposal which has not been expressly and bona
fide publicly withdrawn, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by either the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) and at such time of
termination Parent is not in breach in any material respect of any of its
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, and
(iii) within 12 months after the date of this Agreement the Company enters
into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the transactions
contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal, then, if such Company Takeover
Proposal is consummated, the Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of
same-day funds the Break-up Fee on the date of consummation of such Company
Takeover Proposal. Solely for the purposes of this Section 6.06(c), the term
"Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 9.3(a), except that all references to "20%" shall be changed to
"50%".

  

### 

  

### (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections
6.06(b) and 6.06(c) are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
Break-up Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the Break-up Fee, the
Company shall pay to Parent interest on the Break-up Fee from and including
the date payment of the Break-up Fee was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate of Bank of America, National Association in
effect on the date such payment was

  



  

53      
   



  

### required to be made. If applicable, the Break-Up Fee shall not be
payable more than once pursuant to this Section 6.06.

  

### 

  

## Section 6.07 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the
other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.

  



  

## Section 6.08 _Transfer Taxes_. All stock transfer, real estate
transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by either Merger
Sub or the Surviving Entity (provided any such payments shall not be funded,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries), and the
Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in preparing, executing
and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

## Section 6.09 _Affiliates_. Prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a letter identifying all persons who, to the knowledge of the
Company, were, at the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates"
of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each such person to deliver to
Parent on or prior to Closing a written agreement substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit A_.

  



  

## Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Parent and the Company agree that, in
order to most effectively compensate and retain Company Insiders in
connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Equity Awards into shares of Parent Common Stock and
options to purchase Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
6.10. Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information
in a timely fashion, the Parent Board, or a committee of Non-Employee
Directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by
Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock, RSUs, Performance Awards and Supplemental Retention Units,
options to purchase Parent Common Stock upon conversion of Company
Stock Options and rights to purchase Parent Common Stock upon conversion of
purchase rights under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to
be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act.
In addition, the Company Board, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act)
thereof, shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by Company
Insiders of Company Common Stock, RSUs, Performance Awards and Supplemental
Retention Units, other than Company Stock Options, in exchange for

  



  

54      
   



  

## shares of Parent Common Stock, Company Stock Options in exchange
for options to purchase Parent Common Stock and purchase rights under the
Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan in exchange for rights to purchase
Parent Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant
to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act.  " _Section 16 Information_" shall
mean information accurate in all material respects regarding Company
Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such
Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the
Merger, the number and description of the Company Stock Options held by each
such Company Insider and expected to be converted into options to purchase
Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger. " _Company Insiders_ "
shall mean those officers and directors of Company who are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are
listed in the Section 16 Information. Such actions described in this Section
6.10 shall be taken in accordance with the interpretative letter, dated
January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP.

  



  

## Section 6.11 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

## Section 6.12 _Tax Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Parent and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to use their
commercially reasonable efforts, to take or cause to be taken any action
necessary for the Merger (or, if applicable, a merger pursuant to Section
6.12(d) hereof) to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or alternatively, if applicable, to take or cause to be
taken any action necessary for the Alternative Transaction described in
Section 6.12(c) hereof to qualify as a transaction described in Section 351
of the Code. The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their commercially
reasonable efforts in order for Parent to obtain the opinion of Latham and
Watkins LLP described in Section 7.02(d) and for the Company to obtain the
opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP described in Section
7.03(d). Except with respect to any divestitures that may be undertaken
pursuant to Section 6.03(a), neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall
they permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be
taken any action that would disqualify the Merger (or, if applicable, a
merger pursuant to Section 6.12(d) hereof) as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or alternatively, if applicable, take
or cause to be taken any action that would disqualify the Alternative
Transaction described in Section 6.12(c) hereof as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto
hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of Parent and
the Company shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368 of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  



  

55      
   



  

### (c) In the event that either of Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to Parent,
or Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, counsel to the Company, acting
in good faith, is unable to render its opinion pursuant to Section 7.02(d) or
Section 7.03(d), respectively, because the total fair market value of the
Parent Common Stock received by the Company Stockholders in exchange for
their Company Common Stock is less than 45% of the aggregate fair market
value of the Parent Common Stock and cash received in the Merger or for other
reasons, then at the option of either Parent or the Company, each acting
reasonably, the structure of the Merger shall be revised to provide for (i)
the formation by Parent and the Company of a new corporation (" _Newco_ "),
(ii) the formation by Newco of two (2) wholly-owned corporations (" _Newco
Subs_ ") and (iii) the merger of one Newco Sub with and into Parent with
Parent being the surviving entity and the merger of the other Newco Sub with
and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity, in a series
of transactions that qualify as a transaction described in Section 351 of the
Code (such transactions, collectively, the " _Alternative Transaction_ ").

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event that at the Effective Time, the total fair market value
of the Parent Common Stock that would be received by the Company Stockholders
in exchange for their Company Common Stock is greater than or equal to 80% of
the aggregate fair market value of the Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, then at the option of either Parent or
the Company, each acting reasonably, the structure of the Merger shall be
revised to provide for the merger of a first-tier newly formed corporate
Subsidiary of Parent with and into the Company with the Company being the
surviving entity in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in subsections (c)
and (d) of this Section 6.12, no revision to the structure of the Merger
shall (i) result in any change in the Merger Consideration, (ii) be
materially adverse to the interests of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
holders of shares of Parent Common Stock or the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock or (iii) unreasonably impede or delay consummation of the
Merger. If the structure of the Merger is so revised, this Agreement and
_Exhibits B and C_ shall be amended by the parties as appropriate to give
effect to the revised structure of the Merger with each party executing a
written amendment to this Agreement and _Exhibits B and C_ as necessary to
reflect the foregoing. The parties agree to amend this Agreement to the extent
necessary to provide for more specific mechanics of the alternative
structures described in this Section 6.12.

  

### 

  

## Section 6.13 _Litigation_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and
its directors relating to the Merger or any other Transaction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Parent and its
directors relating to the

  



  

56      
   



  

### Merger or any other Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such settlement shall be agreed to without the Companys consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### 

  

## Section 6.14 _Parent Board_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent Board shall take all action necessary so that, effective immediately
following the Effective Time, William Barron Hilton and Stephen F. Bollenbach
shall be appointed to Parent Board, with William Barron Hilton being placed
in Class I (with a term expiring in 2006) and Stephen F. Bollenbach being
placed in Class II (with a term expiring in 2007). In addition, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof (but in any event prior to the Closing
Date), the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of the Parent Board
shall consider recommending an additional Company director for appointment to
the Parent Board. Parent Board shall also consider the nomination of one
further additional Company director to the Parent Board.

  



  

## Section 6.15 _Company Rights Agreement_. Except for any such actions
permitted to be taken by this Agreement, including Section 5.02, the Company
covenants and agrees that it will not (a) redeem the Company Rights, (b)
amend the Company Rights Agreement or (c) take any action which would allow
any "Person" (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) other than Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary to become a "Beneficial Owner" (for
purposes of this Section 6.15, as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) of
15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock without causing
a "Shares Acquisition Date," or a "Distribution Date" (as each such term is
defined in the Company Rights Agreement) to occur. The Company Board shall
not make a determination that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
"Affiliates" or "Associates" (as such terms are defined in the Company Rights
Agreement) is an "Acquiring Person" for purposes of the Company Rights
Agreement. The Company shall not adopt stockholder rights plan or "poison
pill."

  



  

## Section 6.16 _Title Insurance and Surveys_. Not later than 30 days after
the date hereof, (A) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to Parent (i) all existing surveys for the Company Owned Properties
(other than a licensed property) and each Company Leased Property ground
leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case to the extent
available and in the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys possession and
(ii) all existing title policies for the Company Owned Properties and each
Company Leased Property ground leased by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, together with copies of the underlying documents referenced in
each such title policy, in each case to the extent available and in the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys possession and (B) Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Company (i) all existing
surveys for the Parent Owned Properties (other than a licensed property) and
each Parent Leased Property ground leased by the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, in each case to the extent available and in Parents or any
Parent Subsidiarys possession and (ii) all existing title policies for the
Parent Owned Properties and each Parent Leased Property ground leased by the
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, together with copies of the underlying
documents referenced in each such title policy, in each case to the extent
available and in Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys possession. In addition,
the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to obtain any new survey
or new title policy relating to the Company Owned Properties and any Company
Leased Property ground leased by the Company that Parent reasonably
determines advisable to obtain, provided that the costs of such surveys and
title policies shall be borne solely by Parent. Notwithstanding

Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such partys failure to use all reasonable efforts to

this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

## Section 9.04 _Interpretation; Disclosure Letters_. When a reference is made
in this Agreement to a Section or Subsection, such reference shall be to a
Section or Subsection of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation."

  



  

## Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

## Section 9.06 _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Facsimile
transmission of any signed original document and/or retransmission of any
signed facsimile transmission will be deemed the same as delivery of an
original. At the request of any party, the parties will confirm
facsimile transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

  



  

## Section 9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the documents and instruments relating to the Merger
referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement, taken together with
the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
whether written or oral, among the parties with respect to the Merger and (b)
except for Section 6.05, are not intended to confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding
clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective
Time the provisions of Article II shall be enforceable by holders of
Certificates.

  



  

70      
   



  

## Section 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  



  

## Section 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve
Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement.  Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

to the personal jurisdiction of the state court located in the State of

in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the Merger, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Merger in any

by suit on the judgment or in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

### 

  

### (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY.  EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
