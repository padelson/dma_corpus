One Hundred  and Ten Million Dollars ($110,000,000) in cash, plus (ii) an
amount (which  may  be a positive or negative number) equal to the Net
Working Capital as  of the  Closing Date minus the Net Working Capital

The  Adjustment Amount shall be calculated without giving effect to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. The Adjustment Amount shall be

Adjustment Amount Estimate, together  with the supporting work papers, payoff
letters, invoices and other  documentation described above as well as the

penalty asserted with respect  thereto,  up to $100,000. Target shall be
responsible for all documentary and transfer  taxes and any sales, use or
other taxes or costs imposed by reason of  the  transfers of Assets provided
hereunder and any deficiency, interest or  penalty  asserted with respect

Buyer Parent shall pay to Target on or before the filing of each  such  Tax
Return the amount of transfer Tax shown as due on such Tax Return  that 
relates to the transfers of Assets pursuant to this Agreement, provided 
Target  has complied with its obligations set forth in this Section 1.5(d)
and  provided  further that Buyer Parent shall not be obligated to pay more

9.1, a Party's failure to consummate the Purchase  provided for in this

the components of the Adjustment Amount set forth in  Section  1.5(a)(ii)
(the " _Proposed  Closing Balance Sheet_ ").  Target  shall deliver to

Balance Sheet a detailed  

 

7  

 

statement  describing all of its objections (if any) thereto, including any
objection  to  the calculation of the components of the Adjustment Amount
and a reasonably  detailed description of the basis therefor. Failure of
Target to so  object  within such thirty (30) day period to the Proposed
Closing Balance  Sheet shall  constitute acceptance thereof, whereupon such
Proposed Closing Balance  Sheet  shall be deemed to be the" _Final  Closing
Balance Sheet_." All  items  on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, including
the components of the  Adjustment  Amount, shall be determined and computed
in accordance with GAAP and  on a basis  consistent with and utilizing the
same principles, practices and policies  as  those used in preparing the
Balance Sheets, except to the extent contemplated  in  the definition of Net
Working Capital. Buyer Parent and Target shall  use  reasonable commercial
efforts to resolve any such objections, but if  they do not  reach a final
resolution within thirty (30) days after Buyer Parent  has received  the
statement of objections, Buyer Parent and Target shall select a  nationally-
recognized independent accounting firm, other than an accounting  firm  that
regularly performs services for Buyer Parent, Target or any of  their 
respective Affiliates, mutually acceptable to them (the " _Neutral  Auditors_
")  to  resolve any remaining objections. If Buyer Parent and Target are
unable  to agree  on the choice of Neutral Auditors, they shall select as
Neutral Auditors  a  nationally-recognized accounting firm by lot (after
excluding any accounting  firm that regularly performs services for Buyer
Parent, Target and  their  Affiliates). The Neutral Auditors shall
determine, within sixty (60)  days after  their appointment whether the
objections (on an objection by objection  basis)  raised by Target are
valid. The Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and  documentation  of the
Adjustment Amount contained therein that is the subject of such  objections
by Target shall be adjusted in accordance with the Neutral 
Auditors' determination and, as so adjusted, shall become the Final Closing
Balance  Sheet  and documentation of the Adjustment Amount. Such
determination by the  Neutral  Auditors shall be conclusive and binding upon
Buyer Parent and Target.  Buyer  Parent and Target shall share equally the
fees and expenses of the  Neutral  Auditors.

 

 

 

(b) On  the  fifteenth (15th)  business  day following the determination
of the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the  " _Final  Determination Date_ "):

 

 

(i) if  the  Adjustment Amount as reflected in the Final Closing Balance
Sheet exceeds  the  Adjustment Amount Estimate, then Buyer shall, and Buyer
Parent shall  cause Buyer  to, pay an amount equal to such excess to Target;

 

 

(ii) if  the  Adjustment Amount Estimate exceeds the Adjustment Amount as
reflected  in the  Final Closing Balance Sheet, then Target and Buyer Parent
shall direct  the  Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account an amount
equal to such  excess,  by wire transfer to the accounts specified by Buyer
or Buyer Parent in  writing,  notwithstanding the limitations set forth in
Section 10.5(a); and

 

 

(c) if  neither  clause (i) nor clause (ii) of Section 1.9(b) is applicable,
the Purchase  Price  shall not be adjusted.

 

 

**2.** **REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET.**

 

 

Except  as  set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Target to
Buyer Parent  at or  prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Seller  Disclosure Letter_ "),  Target  represents and warrants to Buyer
and Buyer Parent as follows:

organized, validly existing, and in good standing  under the  laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, with the requisite corporate  power and 
authority to own, lease and operate its property and assets and conduct 
the  business as it is now being conducted. Target is duly qualified to do 
business  as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of
each  state or  other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of
the properties  owned  or used by it, or the nature of the activities
conducted by it, requires  such  qualification, except where the failure to
be so qualified would not  reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The copies of Target's  Organizational Documents and all
unredacted minute books of Target which  were  previously furnished to Buyer
Parent are true, complete and correct copies  of  such documents as in
effect on the date of this Agreement. Target has  no  Subsidiary.

 

 

**2.2** **Authority;  No Conflict**.

 

 

(a) This  Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
Target  and,  assuming that this Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered  by  Buyer and Buyer Parent, constitutes the legally
valid and binding obligation  of  Target, duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action, and enforceable  against Target in accordance with its
terms, subject to (i) the effect  of any  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar  laws  relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally, and (ii) the  effect of equitable
principles (regardless of whether enforceability  is  considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). Target has the requisite  corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and  to  perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Neither  the  execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
performance by Target  of its  obligations under this Agreement shall (with
or without notice or lapse  of time,  or both):

 

 

(i) violate  any  provision of the Organizational Documents of Target;

 

 

(ii) conflict  with or violate any Applicable Laws or any Order, or license
of any Governmental  Body, which is material to Target, and to which any of
the assets owned  or used  by Target, is subject;

 

 

(iii) conflict  with, violate or result in a breach of any provision of, or
give any  Person the  right to declare a default or exercise any remedy
under, or to accelerate  the  maturity or performance of, or to amend,
cancel, terminate, or modify,  any  material obligation or the loss of any
material property, right or benefit  under, any Contract listed or required
to be listed on Part 2.14(a) of  the  Seller Disclosure Letter; or

 

 

(iv) result  in  the imposition or creation of any Encumbrance upon or with
respect to  any of the  equity interests, properties or assets owned by
Target (other than as  set forth  in Part 2.2(b)(iv) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter and any Encumbrance  contemplated by this Agreement or
granted to any lender at the Closing  in  connection with financing of the
Purchase arranged by Buyer or Buyer  Parent).

 

 

 

9  

 

 

(c) Except  for  filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as
may be required  under, and other applicable requirements of, the HSR Act and
any other  required  merger control filings, Target shall not be required to
give any notice  to or  obtain any Consent from (i) any Governmental Body or
(ii) any Person  under any  Contract listed or required to be listed on Part
2.14(a) of the Seller  Disclosure Letter in connection with the execution and
delivery of this  Agreement or the consummation of the Purchase.

 

 

**2.3** **Capitalization**.

 

 

(a) As  of the  date of this Agreement:

 

 

(i) the  capitalization (including a list of all equity ownership and equity
equivalent  interest in the ownership or earnings or other similar rights) of
Target  is set  forth on _Schedule I_  to this  Agreement; there are no
shares of capital stock, membership interest  or other  voting securities
issued and outstanding of Target (including capital  stock  equivalents)
except as so set forth on Part 2.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure  Letter; and
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, membership  interest  or
other voting securities of Target are held beneficially and of record  by
the  Persons set forth on Part 2.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter;

 

 

(ii) all  of the  outstanding shares of capital stock and other securities
of Target are  free and  clear of all Encumbrances; and

 

 

(iii) all  of the  outstanding shares of capital stock of Target have been
duly authorized  and  validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable,
and were not issued  in  violation of any preemptive rights.

 

 

(b) None  of the  outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of
Target was  issued in  violation of the Securities Act or any other
Applicable Laws.

 

 

(c) No  bonds,  debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Target having the
right to  vote on  any matters on which shareholders or equity holders may
vote are issued  or  outstanding.

 

 

**2.4** **Financial  Statements; Books and Records**.  Target has 
delivered to Buyer Parent: (a) the audited balance sheets of Target as  at 
December 31, 2004 (restated) and December 31, 2005 (the " _Balance  Sheets_
"),  and the  related statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of  the fiscal years then ended, including in each case the
notes thereto,  together  with the auditors' report thereon of Clothier and
Head P.S. (the " _Audited  Financial Statements_ ");  and (b)  the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Target as at October 31,  2006
(the " _Interim  Balance Sheet_ ")  and the  related unaudited statement
of income for the period then ended (the "Interim  Financial Statements" and
together with the Audited Financial Statements, the " _Financial_
_Statements_ ").  The  Audited Financial Statements fairly present the
financial condition and  the  results of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows of Target  as at the respective dates of
and for the periods referred to in such  Audited  Financial Statements, and
the Interim Financial Statements fairly present  the  financial condition
and the results of operations as at the respective  dates of  and for the
periods referred to in such Interim Financial Statements,  in each  case all
in accordance with GAAP, subject, in the case of the  

 

10  

 

Audited  Financial Statements, to the qualification set forth in the third
paragraph  of  the auditors' report of Clothier and Head, P.S. dated February
11, 2006, and  subject further, in the case of the Interim Financial
Statements, to  customary  year-end adjustments, which would not reasonably
be expected to result  in a  Material Adverse Effect, and the absence of
footnotes and statements  of  stockholders equity and cash flows. The
Financial Statements reflect  the  consistent application of such accounting
principles throughout the  periods  involved, except as disclosed in the
footnotes to the Financial Statements  and  the qualifications noted above.

 

 

 

**2.5** **Title  to Properties; Encumbrances**.

 

 

(a) As  of the  date of this Agreement, Target does not own any real
property. Part 2.5(a)  of  the Seller Disclosure Letter contains:

 

 

(i) a  complete  and accurate list as of the date of this Agreement of all
leasehold real  property, or real property operated or used, or other real
property interests  owned or held by Target (collectively, the " _Real 
Property_ ");

 

 

(ii) a  complete  and accurate list as of the date of this Agreement of each
item of equipment,  fixtures and other tangible assets (other than inventory)
owned by Target  having  a book value greater than five thousand dollars
($5,000); and

 

 

(iii) a  complete  and accurate list as of the date of this Agreement of
each tangible asset  currently leased to Target requiring monthly lease
payments in excess  of five  thousand dollars ($5,000).

 

 

Target  has  made available to Buyer Parent true and complete copies of all
Real Property  leases or subleases. Each Real Property lease or sublease is
valid and  binding  on Target and, to the Knowledge of Target, on the other
parties thereto  and is  in full force and effect. Target and, to the
Knowledge of Target, each  of the  other parties to each Real Property lease
has performed in all material  respects  all material obligations required
to be performed by it thereunder. The  Real  Property complies with
Applicable Laws and is the subject of those material  permits or licenses
required to be maintained for the use or occupancy  by Target  of the Real
Property. Target has not granted any legal or equitable interests  (including
without limitation rights to sublease) in respect of the Real  Property,
except for Permitted Encumbrances.

 

 

(b) Target  has  good and marketable title to, or has valid leasehold
interests in, all  material  personal property owned or leased by Target and
used in the operation  of the  Business or reflected on the Interim Balance
Sheet or acquired after  the date of  the Interim Balance Sheet, in each
case free and clear of all Encumbrances,  except for Permitted Encumbrances,
and except for personal property and  assets  sold since the date of the
Interim Balance Sheet in the ordinary course  of  business consistent with
past practices. Except as set forth in Part  2.5(b) of  the Seller
Disclosure Letter, such properties include all properties  and assets 
necessary for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted. With 
respect  to any properties or assets identified on Part 2.5(b) of the Seller
Disclosure  Letter that are used in the Business (i.e., molds, dyes,
applicators  and similar  items), Target will make available such properties
and assets (or replacement  properties and assets that are substantially
equivalent in  

 

11  

 

quality  and  function) through license, assignment, replacement or other
similar  means so  that Buyer may operate the Business uninterrupted in the
manner currently  conducted. All assets and properties of Target (including,
but not  limited to,  molds, dies, applicators, tooling machinery and
similar items and equipment)  owned or leased by Target and necessary for
Buyer to conduct the Business  in the  manner currently conducted by Target
are in good operating condition  and repair  (ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and subject to normal and customary  maintenance requirements) and
are usable in the ordinary course of  business and  conform in all material
respects to all Applicable Laws relating to  their use  and operation.

 

 

 

**2.6** **Accounts  Receivable**.

 

 

(a) All  accounts  receivable of Target that are reflected on the Interim
Balance Sheet  and on the  Closing Balance Sheets as of the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Accounts  Receivable_ ")  represent  or shall
represent valid obligations arising from sales actually made  or  services
actually performed in the ordinary course of business consistent  with  past
practices and require or shall require no additional performance  by Target 
to render them valid in accordance with GAAP.

 

 

(b) Unless  paid  prior to the Closing Date, the Accounts Receivable are or
shall be as  of the  Closing Date current and collectible in the aggregate
in the ordinary  course of  business consistent with past practices, without
out-of-pocket collection  fees  and expenses payable to third parties in
collections efforts therefor  and net of  the aggregate reserves for
uncollectible accounts, if any, shown on the  Financial Statements and on the
Final Closing Balance Sheet (which reserves  are,  except as noted in the
Final Closing Balance Sheet, calculated consistent  with  past practices).

 

 

**2.7** **No  Undisclosed Liabilities**.  Target has  no liabilities except
for (i) liabilities reflected or reserved against  on the  balance sheets
included in the Audited Financial Statements or the Interim  Balance Sheet,
(ii) current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of  business
consistent with past practices since the date of the Interim  Balance 
Sheet, and (iii) liabilities incurred after the date hereof and expressly

12  

 

Letter  identifies each current or previously existing permanent
establishment  of Target  in any foreign country, as defined in any
applicable Tax treaty or  convention  between the United States of America
and such foreign country. Part  2.9(a) of  the Seller Disclosure Letter sets
forth each jurisdiction where Target  is or has  been required to file a Tax
Return with respect to each open Tax period,  but  Target is not making any
representation to Buyer or Buyer Parent as  to where  Buyer may be required
to file any Tax Return after the Closing. Sellers  have  delivered or made
available to Buyer Parent copies of all Tax Returns  relating  to all open
Tax periods, and complete and accurate copies of all examination  reports and
statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to  by Target  or any
of the Sellers with respect to Taxes of Target for all open  Tax periods. 
All Taxes due by Target (whether or not shown on a Tax Return) have  been
paid or  will be reserved against on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, and
all  Taxes of  Target due on or prior to the Closing will be timely paid.
Such Taxes,  if any,  as are listed in Part 2.9(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter are being  contested in good faith and, to the extent of such unpaid
Taxes, adequate  reserves will be provided on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet.

 

 

 

(b) Part  2.9(b)  of the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list  of all  audits of all United States federal and state
franchise or income Tax  Returns of  Target for Tax periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2001. All deficiencies  proposed as a result of such audits
have been paid, will be reserved  against on  the Final Closing Balance
Sheet, settled, or, as described in Part 2.9(a)  of the  Seller Disclosure
Letter, are being contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings.
Neither Target nor any Seller has given waivers or extensions  (or  is or
would be subject to a waiver or extension given by any other Person)  of 
any statute of limitations relating to the payment of Taxes of Target  or
for  which Target may be liable.

 

 

(c) There  exists  no proposed tax assessment against Target except as
disclosed in the  Interim  Balance Sheet.

 

 

(d) There  are no  Encumbrances on any of the assets of Target that arose in

extent required, have been  paid to  the proper Governmental Body or other
Person.

 

 

(f) Except  as  set forth in Part 2.9(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
Target has  not been a  member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated,
combined or unitary  Tax  Return for federal, state, local or foreign Tax
purposes. Target does  not have  any actual or potential liability for the
Taxes of any Person (other  than Taxes  of Target) (i) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar  laws),  (ii) as a transferee or
successor, (iii) by contract, or (iv)  otherwise.

 

 

(g) Target  has  not participated in and is not participating in an
international boycott  within  the meaning of IRC Section 999.

a "confidential  corporate tax shelter" within the  

 

13  

 

meaning  of  Section 6111(d) of the IRC and Treasury Regulation Section
301.6111-2,  as in  effect prior to the enactment of the American Jobs
Creation Act of  2004, or  (iii) any similar transaction required to be
disclosed to a Tax authority  under  applicable Tax Law.

 

 

 

(i) Target  has  been an "S Corporation" within the meaning of Section
136l(a)(l) of the IRC (and  any comparable provision of state and local law

15  

 

been  threatened orally or in writing, and (ii) no event has occurred and
no  circumstances exist that may give rise to or serve as a basis for the 
commencement of any such Proceeding. Each Target Employee Plan can  be
amended,  terminated or otherwise discontinued within 30 days after the
Closing  Date in  accordance with its terms, without liability to Buyer,
Buyer Parent  or Target  (other than ordinary administration expenses) and
without the vesting  or  acceleration of any benefits promised by such
Target Employee Plan.  Neither  Target nor any Target Affiliate has incurred

Plan.

 

 

(f) Target  has  never maintained, established, sponsored, participated in,
or contributed  to a  plan or arrangement that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA, and Target  does not  have any liability or obligation under any such

ERISA.

 

 

(g) Target  has  never maintained, established, sponsored, participated in,
or contributed  to any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section

(h) No  Target  Employee Plan provides, or reflects or represents any
liability of Target  to  provide, retiree life insurance, retiree health or
other retiree employee  welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except
as may be required  by  COBRA or other Applicable Laws. Target has never
represented, promised  or  contracted (whether in oral or written form) to

welfare benefit to any Person,  except  to the extent required by COBRA or
similar provisions of Applicable  Laws.

 

 

(i) Prior  to the  Closing Date, Target has complied in all material
respects with the requirements  of COBRA, the requirements of FMLA, the
requirements of HIPAA, and any  similar  provisions of Applicable Laws.

 

 

(j) There  is no  Target Employee Plan or other contract, agreement or
benefit arrangement  covering any current or former employee or independent
contractor of  Target or  any Target Affiliate which, individually or
collectively, would give  rise to the  payment of, or permit any such
individual to retain, any amount or benefit  which  would constitute a
"parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the IRC).  Except as set
forth on Part 2.10(j) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,  neither the 
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Purchase or any  of
the  transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence 
of any  additional or subsequent events, including, without limitation, a
termination  of  employment) will (i) result in any obligation or liability
(with respect  to  accrued benefits or otherwise) on the part of Target or
any Target Affiliate  to  any Target Employee Plan, or to any present or
former employee, director,  officer, shareholder, contractor or consultant of
Target or any Target  Affiliate  or any of their dependents, (ii) be an
event under any Target Employee  Plan that  will result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming  due  to any such present
or former employee, officer, director, shareholder,  contractor, or
consultant, or any

 

 

16  

 

of  their  dependents, or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or increase  the  amount, of any compensation theretofore or thereafter due
or granted  to any  employee, officer, director, shareholder, independent
contractor, or  consultant  of Target or any Target Affiliate or any of
their dependents.

compensation plan" (as defined  under Section 409A(d)(1) of the IRC) has been
operated and administered  in good  faith compliance with Section 409A of
the IRC and Internal Revenue Service  Notice 2005-1 since January 1, 2005.

(a) Target  is,  and has been at all times, in compliance in all material
respects with  all  Applicable Laws that are or were at such times
applicable to it, and  Target has  not received any written or to the

and complete list  of all  material Government Authorizations reasonably
necessary for the operation  of the  Business as currently conducted, each
of which is valid and in full force  and  effect. Target is, and has been at
all times, in compliance with its  respective  obligations under such
Governmental Authorizations. Target has not received  a  written notice,
which is pending, that challenges, revokes or notifies  Target of  an intent
not to renew any such Governmental Authorizations or that Target  requires
any Governmental Authorization required for the Business that  is not 
currently held by it.

 

 

(c) All  material  reports, documents, claims, notices or approvals required
to be filed,  obtained,  maintained, or furnished to any Governmental Body

material respects on the date  filed (or  were corrected in or supplemented
by a subsequent filing).

 

 

(d) Neither  Target, nor, to the Knowledge of the Target, its officers,
directors  or managing  employees, have engaged in any activities in their
capacity as an officer,  director or managing employee, as applicable, which
are prohibited under  federal  or state criminal or civil laws or the
regulations promulgated pursuant  to such  laws.

 

 

**2.12** **Legal  Proceedings; Orders**.

 

 

(a) There  are no  Proceedings by or before any Governmental Body pending
or, to the Knowledge  of  Target, threatened in writing against Target
relating to Target or its  Business,  Assets or property or seeking to
enjoin the Purchase. Target is not a  party to  any litigation (and Target
has not been threatened in writing with any  litigation) which would
reasonably be expected to affect or prohibit  the  consummation of the
Purchase. To the Knowledge of Target, no demand or  statement  has been
threatened or made (orally or in writing) or any notice has  been given 
(orally or in writing)

to the Business.

under (as the case may be), all of the Assets (except as contemplated  by

disclosed in Part 2.15 of the  Seller  Disclosure Letter the absence of or

**2.17** **Insurance**.  As of the  date of this Agreement, Target maintains
in effect the general liability  and  other insurance policies covering the

(the " _Policies_ "),  and such  Policies (or substantially equivalent
renewals or replacements thereof,  except  as market conditions may
otherwise not reasonably allow and as disclosed  in  Part 2.17 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter) shall be maintained in effect by  Target through the
Closing Date. Part 2.17 of the Seller Disclosure Letter  sets  forth the
type and amount of coverage and the expiration dates of each  of the 
Policies. Target has paid all premiums due, and has otherwise performed  all
of  its obligations, under the Policies. The Policies are valid and
enforceable  in  accordance with their terms, are in full force and effect
and insure  Target  against the risks usually insured against by Persons
operating similar  businesses or properties of similar size in the localities
(including  third  party locations where inventory, molds, dies,
applicators, tolling machinery  and  similar items and equipment are
located) where such businesses or properties  are  located and provide
coverage as may be required by any and all Contracts  that  Target is a
party to and have been issued by insurers of recognized  responsibility.
There is no material claim by Target pending under any  of such  Policies or
bonds as to which coverage has been denied or is being materially  disputed
by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. Target has not  received  any
written notice relating to or threatening any termination of, or  material 
premium increase with respect to, any of such Policies.

Liability, including  without  limitation any response costs or natural

called "superfund" or "superlien" law or similar  Environmental Law.

 

 

(b) Target  is,  and at all times has been, in material compliance with any
applicable  Environmental Law or any Occupational Safety and Health Law,

ending on or before the Closing Date. Such access by such  Persons may  not

constitutes a breach of any of Target's representations  and warranties as of
the date of this Agreement that would reasonably  be  expected to result in
a failure to satisfy any of the conditions in  Article 7, or if such Party
becomes aware of the occurrence after the date  of this Agreement of any fact
or condition that would (except as expressly  contemplated by this Agreement)
cause or constitute a breach of any such  representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made  as of  the Closing Date that would
reasonably be expected to result in a failure  to  satisfy any of the
conditions in Article 7\. Between the date of this  

 

37  

 

Agreement  and the Closing, each Party shall promptly notify the other
Parties  in writing  if such Party becomes aware of any fact or condition
that causes or  constitutes  a material breach of any Party's covenants and
other agreements herein; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants  or 
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the 
parties  under this Agreement or limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available  hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

 

 

**5.6** **No  Negotiation**.  Until such  time, if any, as this Agreement

Stockholders, nor any of their respective Affiliates  or  Representatives
shall, directly or indirectly:

 

 

(a) solicit,  initiate, encourage, take any action to facilitate or induce
any inquiry  with  respect to, the making, submission or announcement of,

provision of, any confidentiality  or  standstill agreement to which it is a
party. Target shall promptly notify  Buyer  Parent of any bona fide written

restrictions set forth in Section 5.6(a)-(e) by any  Representative of any of
Target or Target Stockholders, whether or not  such  Person is purporting to
act on behalf of such Persons, shall be a breach  of this  Section 5.6 by
Target and Target Stockholders. As promptly as practicable,  and  in any

Stockholders of any inquiry, any request for information, or the making  of

but not limited to,  with  respect to the transactions contemplated hereby),
and any out of pocket  expenses  incurred therefor shall be borne by the

(b) **Withholding**.  At or  prior to the Closing, Seller Representative

,  _however_ ,  that Buyer  Parent may make any public statement in
response to specific questions  by the  press, analysts, investors or those

agree to any material modification  of the  terms of such Government
Contracts in order to obtain any such consent,  approval  or novation.

terms of  a Subcontract Agreement in a form to be mutually agreed upon by the
Parties  hereto (the " _Subcontract  Agreement_ "). 

 

 

(c) _Assignment  After Closing_.  If, after  the Closing Date, Target and
Buyer and/or Buyer Parent obtain the necessary  consent or approval for the
assignment or novation of a  

 

41  

 

Government  Contract for which an assignment or novation is required, then

Buyer and/or  Buyer  Parent promptly after Target and Buyer and/or Buyer
Parent obtain such  consent  or approval or effect such a novation.

 

 

 

(d) _Bids_.  Target,  Stockholders' Representative, Buyer and Buyer Parent
shall cooperate with each  other and use their reasonable efforts to preserve

of Contracts with a Governmental Body, shall  be deemed  to be "Government
Contracts" for purposes of this Agreement and shall be  governed by this
Section 6.5.

 

 

(e) _Qualified  Products Lists_.  Between  the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, Buyer and/or Buyer Parent  and  Target shall cooperate to

all  Contracts.

cure until the earlier of (A) ten (10)  business  days following notice
thereof by Target to Buyer Parent and (B) immediately  prior to Closing;

 

 

(b) by  Buyer  Parent, upon written notice in the event of a material breach

warranty or  covenant  has continued without cure until the earlier of (A)
ten (10) business  days  following notice thereof by Buyer Parent to Target
and (B) immediately  prior to  Closing, except where the failure of such
representation and warranty  to be true  and correct (without giving effect
to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth

Adverse Effect of Target;

 

 

(c) by  Buyer  Parent if a Material Adverse Effect on Target shall have
occurred;

 

 

(d) by  mutual  consent of Buyer Parent and Target;

 

 

(e) by  either  Buyer Parent or Target, if any Governmental Body shall have

**9.2** **Effect  of Termination**.  Each  Party's right of termination
under Section 9.1 is in addition to any other  rights it may have under this

**10.4** **Indemnification  Process**.  The Person  making a claim for
indemnification under this Article 10 shall be, for  the  purposes of this
Agreement, referred to as the " _Indemnified  Party_ " (provided  that for
the purpose of paragraph (c) below such term shall refer to  the Party 
hereto to whom such Person is related for purposes of obtaining the benefits 
of  this Article 10) and the Party or Parties against whom such claims are 
asserted  under this Article 10 shall be, for the purposes of this Agreement,
referred  to  as the " _Indemnifying  Party_." All  Claims by any
Indemnified Party under this Article 10 shall be asserted  and  resolved as
follows:

 

 

(a) **Notice  of Claims**.  In the  event that (i) any claim is asserted or
instituted against any Indemnified  Party  by any Person other than the
Parties to this Agreement or their Affiliates  which  could give rise to
Damages for which an Indemnifying Party could be liable  to an  Indemnified
Party for Damages under this Agreement (such claim, demand  or  Proceeding,
a " _Third  Party Claim_ ")  or (ii)  any Indemnified Party under this
Agreement shall have a claim to be indemnified  for Damages by any
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which does  not  involve a Third
Party Claim (such claim, together with Third Party Claims,  " _Claims_ "), 
the  Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness send to the
Indemnifying  Party a written notice specifying the nature of such Claim, the
amount  of  Damages sought in such Claim, if known, and the provisions of
this Agreement  in  respect of which such right of indemnification is
claimed or arises (a  " _Claim  Notice_ "),  provided, that a delay or
failure in notifying the Indemnifying Party  shall not  relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement  except to  the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates such delay or failure 
shall  have caused the Damages for which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated  to be  greater than such Damages would have been had the
Indemnified Party given  the  Indemnifying Party timely notice and only to
the extent of the increased  amount  of Damages.

 

 

(i) If  the  Stockholders' Representative does not object in writing within
the thirty (30)  calendar day period after delivery by Buyer or Buyer Parent
of an initial  Claim  Notice and within the fifteen (15) calendar day period
after delivery  by Buyer  or Buyer Parent of a second Claim Notice (which
shall not be delivered  until the  expiration of the thirty (30) day period
relating to the initial Claim  Notice),  such failures to so object shall be
an irrevocable acknowledgment by  the  Stockholders' Representative on
behalf of Target Stockholders that the Buyer  Indemnitees identified in the
Claim Notice are entitled to the full amount  of  the claim for Damages set
forth in such Claim Notice. If Buyer or Buyer  Parent  does not object in
writing within the thirty (30) calendar day period  after  delivery by the
Stockholders' Representative of an initial Claim Notice and  within the
fifteen (15) calendar day period after delivery by the
Stockholders' Representative of a second Claim Notice (which shall not be
delivered  until the  expiration of the thirty (30) day period relating to
the initial Claim  Notice),  such failures to so object shall be an
irrevocable acknowledgement by  Buyer and  Buyer Parent that the Seller
Indemnitees identified in the Claim Notice  are  entitled to the full amount
of the claim for Damages set forth in such  Claim  Notice.

 

 

(ii) After  the  expiration of fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of a
second Claim  Notice  from the Stockholders' Representative, Buyer Parent
shall make delivery of cash  equal to the amount of Damages claimed in the
Claim Notice; _provided_   that no  such payment shall be made if Buyer
Parent shall object in a written  statement  to the claim made in the Claim
Notice (a " _Buyer  Objection Notice_ "),  and  such

 

 

48  

 

Buyer  Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the Stockholders'
Representative  prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15) calendar day
period.

 

 

(iii)   After the  expiration of fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of
a second Claim  Notice  from the Buyer or Buyer Parent, Stockholders'
Representative shall make delivery  of cash equal to the amount of Damages
claimed in the Claim Notice; _provided_   that no  such payment shall be
made if Stockholders' Representative shall object in a  written statement to
the claim made in the Claim Notice (a " _Stockholders '  Objection
Notice_" and,  together with Buyer Objection Notice, an " _Objection 
Notice_ "),  and such  Stockholders' Objection Notice shall have been
delivered to the Buyer and Buyer  Parent prior to the expiration of such
fifteen (15) calendar day  period.

 

 

(iv) If  Buyer or  Buyer Parent shall deliver a Claim Notice and Buyer
Parent owes any portion  of  the indemnification payments required to be
paid by the Buyer Parent  pursuant to  this Article 10 hereof, Buyer Parent
shall be entitled to set-off the  amount set  forth in the Claim Notice.

 

 

(b)

 

 

(i) If  an  Indemnifying Party objects in writing to any claim (or part of
any claim)  for  indemnification made by an Indemnified Party in any
Objection Notice,  the  Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall
attempt in good faith  to agree  upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such  claims.  If the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party should so agree, a memorandum  setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties. 

 

 

(ii) If  no such  agreement has been reached within thirty (30) days after
delivery of  an  Objection Notice, either Buyer Parent or the Stockholders'
Representative may  demand arbitration of the matter in a proceeding
administered by the  American  Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ") 
under its  commercial arbitration rules, unless the amount of the Damage that
is  at issue  is the subject of a pending litigation involving a Third Party
Claim,  in which  event such arbitration shall be resolved as set forth in
Section 10.4(c)  below.  In the event that, within fifteen (15) days after
submission of any dispute  to  arbitration, Buyer Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative cannot mutually  agree on one arbitrator, then,
within fifteen (15) days after the end  of such  fifteen (15) day period,
Buyer Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall  each select one
arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select  a third 
arbitrator. If the Stockholders' Representative fails to select an
arbitrator  during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that
the  arbitration  will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by Buyer
Parent. If Buyer  Parent  fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen
(15) day period, then  the  parties agree that the arbitration will be
conducted by one arbitrator  selected  by the Stockholders' Representative.
Each arbitrator must be certified as an  arbitrator by the AAA.

 

 

(iii) Any  such  arbitration shall be held in Orange County, California,
under the rules  then in  effect of the AAA. The arbitrator(s) shall
determine

 

 

49  

 

how  all  expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including the
respective  expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the
administrative  fee  of the AAA. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case
may be, shall  set a  limited time period and establish procedures designed
to reduce the cost  and  time for discovery while allowing the parties an
opportunity, adequate  in the  sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority
of the three arbitrators,  as the  case may be, to discover relevant
information from the opposing parties  about  the subject matter of the
dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the  three  arbitrators, as the
case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or  limit  discovery and
shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including  attorneys' fees and
costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity,  should 
the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may 
be,  determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification 
or that  discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification.  The  decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as  the case  may be, as to the validity and amount of any
claim shall be final, binding,  and  conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement. Such conclusions shall  set forth  the award, judgment, decree or
order awarded by the arbitrator(s). Within  fifteen (15) days of a decision
of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment  by one  party to another, such party
shall make the payment to such other party. 

 

 

(iv) Judgment  upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in
any court  having  jurisdiction. The foregoing arbitration provision shall
apply to any  dispute  between Indemnifying Parties and Indemnified Parties
under this Article  X  hereof.

 

 

(c) **Third  Party Claims**.  In the  event of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled  to assume  and control the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to appoint counsel  of the  Indemnifying Party's
choice at the expense of the Indemnifying Party to  represent the Indemnified
Party and any others the Indemnifying Party  may  reasonably designate in
connection with such Third Party Claim (in which  case  the Indemnifying
Party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees  and  expenses of any
separate counsel retained by any Indemnified Party except  as set  forth
below); provided, that such counsel is reasonably acceptable to  the 
Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, 
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding an Indemnifying Party's election to 
appoint counsel to represent an Indemnified Party in connection with  a
Third  Party Claim, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
counsel,  and  the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses  of one  such separate counsel if there exists a conflict of
interest (including  the  availability of one or more legal defenses to the
Indemnified Party which  are  not available to the Indemnifying Party) that
would make it inappropriate  in the  reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party (upon and in conformity  with advice  of counsel to the Indemnified
Party) for the same counsel to represent  both the  Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, provided, that the Indemnified  Party and such
counsel shall contest such Third Party Claim in good faith.  The 
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its 
counsel in  such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all
witnesses,  records, materials, and information in the Indemnified Party's
possession or  under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as may
be reasonably  requested by the Indemnifying Party, and in contesting any
Claim, demand  or  Proceeding which the Indemnifying Party defends or, if
appropriate and  related  to the Claim, demand or Proceeding in question, in
making any counterclaim  against the  

 

 

50  

 

Person  asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any 
Person. In  the event the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of
such  Third Party  Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice
thereof in  accordance with  the terms hereof, (i) the Indemnified Party
against which such Third  Party Claim  has been asserted shall have the
right to undertake the defense and  the  Indemnifying Party shall be liable
for all fees and expenses incurred  in  connection with such defense, and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party agrees  to  cooperate with the Indemnified Party
in such defense and make available  to the  Indemnified Party, all
witnesses, records, materials and information  in the  Indemnifying Party's
possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control  relating thereto as may
be reasonably requested by the Indemnified  Party. 

 

 

 

 

(d) **Settlement  of Third Party Claims**.  If the  Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in connection  with  Section
10.4(c) hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to  settle  such
Claim; provided, that in connection with the settlement or compromise  of 
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the 
written  consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any
Third Party  Claims  or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not
include as an  unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff  to the  Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability
in respect  of such  Third Party Claim of all Indemnified Parties affected
by such Third Party  Claim.  No Third Party Claim which is being defended in
good faith by the Indemnifying  Party or which is being defended by the
Indemnified Party in accordance  with the  terms of this Agreement shall be
settled or compromised by the Indemnified  Party  without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent  shall not  be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

 

(e) **Reduction  of Losses; Duty to Mitigate**.  To the  extent any Damages
of an Indemnified Party are reduced by receipt of  payment  under insurance
policies or from third parties (a " _Reimbursement_ "),  such  payment shall
be credited against any such Damages. The Indemnified Party  shall  use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue payment under or from any 
insurer  or third party in respect of such Damages. If any Reimbursement is
obtained  subsequent to payment by an Indemnifying Party in respect of any
Damages,  such  Reimbursement shall be promptly paid over to the Escrow
Account or the  Indemnifying Party. Each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts  to  mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification from  any other  Party under this Agreement.

 

 

(f) **Interpretation**.  For  purposes of this Section 10.4, once it has
been determined that a  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Target, Target Stockholders,  or Buyer or Buyer Parent contained in this
Agreement or any exhibit,  schedule,  certificate (including the Seller
Disclosure Letter) or agreement delivered  by  such party pursuant hereto
has been breached and such breach gives rise  to a  claim for Damages, such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement  shall be  deemed not to be
qualified by any threshold amount, limitation as to  materiality  or to
whether or not any such breach results or may result in a Material  Adverse 
Effect for such Person for purposes of determining the Damages incurred  or 
suffered arising out of any such breach and no deduction from such Damages 
shall  be taken on account of any threshold amount, materiality or Material 
Adverse  Effect qualification contained in any representation, warranty,
covenant  or  agreement giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder.

 

 

 

51  

 

 

(g) **Access**.  From and  after the delivery of a Claim Notice under this
Agreement, at the reasonable  request of the Indemnifying Party, and subject
to compliance with Section  12.2,  each Indemnified Party shall grant the
Indemnifying Party and its  Representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees  and  properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related  to the  matters to which the Claim Notice
relates. All such access shall be granted  during normal business hours and
shall be granted under conditions which  shall  not unreasonably interfere
with the business and operations of such Indemnified  Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, and shall require that its  Representatives do not, use
(except in connection with such Claim Notice)  or  disclose to any third
Person other than the Indemnifying Party's Representatives  (except as may be
required by Applicable Laws) any information obtained  pursuant  to this
Section 10.4(g) which is designated as confidential by an  Indemnified Party.

 

 

**10.5** **Limitations  on Amount - Sellers**.

 

 

(a) Subject  to  Sections 1.8 and 1.9(b)(ii), no amount shall be payable by
any Seller  pursuant  to Section 10.2 unless the aggregate amount of Damages
indemnifiable  thereunder exceeds Seven Hundred Thousand dollars ($700,000)
(the "Basket"), in  which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover the full  amount  of such Damages; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that
such  Basket will not apply to, nor be reduced in respect of, any claim for 
indemnification made by any Indemnified Party that results from: (A) 
intentional  misrepresentation, fraud or willful breach hereof, (B) the
breach of  the  representations or warranties set forth in Sections 2.1,
2.2, 2.3, 2.9,  2.10,  2.18, 2.19, 2.24 and 2.28 (or the corresponding

10.2(d) (but only  with  respect to any Stockholder Actions), 10.2(e) or
10.2(f).

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the maximum amount  of  indemnifiable Damages which may be recovered by the
Buyer Indemnitees  from the  Sellers arising out of, resulting from or
incident to, the matters enumerated  in  Section 10.2 shall be an amount
equal to the Escrow Amount; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that this  Section
10.5(b) will not apply to any claim for indemnification made  by any 
Indemnified Party that results from: (A) intentional misrepresentation, 
fraud or  willful breach hereof, (B) the breach of the representations or
warranties  set  forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.9, 2.10, 2.18, 2.19,
2.24 and 2.28  (or the  corresponding sections of the Seller Disclosure
Letter), (C) the breach  of any  covenants as set forth in Articles 5 or 6
or (D) claims made under Sections  10.2(d) (but only with respect to any
Stockholder Actions), 10.2(e) or  10.2(f). 

 

 

(c) To  the  extent a Seller discharges any Claim for indemnification
hereunder, such  Seller  shall be subrogated to all related rights of the
Buyer Indemnitee against  third  parties concerning such Third Party Claims.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
will any Indemnified  Party be entitled to receive indemnification under this
Article 10 for  Damages  relating to any matter for any punitive damages
other than to the extent  that an  Indemnified Party is seeking to obtain
through indemnification reimbursement  resulting from a punitive damage award
against it in a Third Party Claim. 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

**10.6** **Limitations  - Buyer and Buyer Parent**.

 

 

(a) To  the  extent Buyer or Buyer Parent discharges any Claim for
indemnification  hereunder,  it shall be subrogated to all related rights of
the Seller Indemnitee  against  third parties concerning such Third Party
Claims.

 

 

(b) No  amount  shall be payable by Buyer or Buyer Parent for any Damages to
the extent  the  Seller Indemnitees shall have already received
indemnification in respect  of  such Damages under this Article 10.

 

 

**10.7** **Escrow**.  Upon the  second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, in accordance with the  terms of  the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall release from the Escrow  Account an  amount equal to Ten Million
Dollars ($10,000,000) minus the amount of  any Claims  made pursuant to
Section 10.2 (whether or not such Claims have been determined  to be valid as
of such date, provided that such amounts shall be so released  as  soon as
and to the extent that any such Claim has been determined not  to be 
valid).

 

 

**10.8** **Exclusivity  of Indemnification Remedy**.  Except for  any
equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance,  to 
which any Party hereto may be entitled, from and after the Closing, the 
indemnification provided in this Article 10 shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy of any Party hereto with respect to any breach of a representation, 
warranty or covenant in this Agreement.

 

 

**10.9** **Treatment  of Indemnification Payments**.  All  indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Article 10 shall be treated  by  the Parties

(a) Each  of the  Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself  and  its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
state or federal courts  of  the State of California, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in  any  Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements  delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating  thereto,  and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees  not to  commence any such
Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that  any claim  in respect of
any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in any  such court,  (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do  so, any 
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of  any
such  Proceeding in any such court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted  by  Applicable Laws, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance  of such  Proceeding in any such court. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that  a final  judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced  in other  jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided  by  Applicable Laws. Each Party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to  service of  process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 12.3. Process in  any  Proceeding referred
to in this Section 12.4 may be served on any Party  anywhere  in the world.

 

 

(b) The  Parties  agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the  provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their  specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that  the  Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent  breaches of  this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of  this  Agreement.

 

 

 

56

this Agreement.

 

 

**12.6** **Stockholders '  Representative**.

 

 

(a) Target  Stockholders hereby irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint
John  D. Dondero  as the agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of
Target Stockholders  (the " _Stockholders '  Representative_"),  with 
full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of Target 
Stockholders for purposes of executing any documents and taking any actions 
that  Stockholders' Representative may, in his sole discretion, determine to
be  necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection with any of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. John D. Dondero hereby accepts
his appointment  as a Stockholders' Representative.

 

 

(i) Target  Stockholders hereby grant to Stockholders' Representative full
authority to  execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of
Target Stockholders  (in the name of any or all of Target Stockholders or
otherwise) any and  all  documents that Stockholders' Representative may, in
his sole discretion,  determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in
such forms and  containing such provisions as Stockholders' Representative
may, in his sole  discretion, determine to be appropriate (including any
amendment to or  waiver of  rights under any of this Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary  contained in this Agreement:

 

 

(1) Buyer  and  Buyer Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with
Stockholders' Representative on all Target Stockholder-related matters
relating to  this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including  all  matters relating to any notice to, or any Consent
to be given or action  to be  taken by, any Target Stockholder); and

 

 

(2) each  Buyer  Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence  of  any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed  on  behalf of any Target Stockholder by
Stockholders' Representative, and on any  other action taken or purported to
be taken on behalf of any Target Stockholder  by any Stockholders'
Representative, as fully binding upon such Target  Stockholder.

 

 

(ii) Target  Stockholders recognize and intend that the power of attorney
granted  in this  Section 12.6:

 

 

(1) is  coupled  with an interest and is irrevocable;

 

 

(2) may  be  delegated by Stockholders' Representative; and

 

 

 

57  

 

 

(3) shall  survive the death or incapacity of each Target Stockholder.

 

 

(iii) The  Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to treat as
genuine, and as the  document it purports to be, any letter, facsimile, telex
or other document  that  is believed by Stockholders' Representative to be
genuine and to have been  telexed, telegraphed, faxed or cabled by a Target
Stockholder or to have  been  signed and presented by a Target Stockholder.

 

 

(iv) In  the event  of the resignation, death or incapacity of a
Stockholders' Representative, then  a majority of the Shares held by Target
Stockholders as of the Closing  (or by  their personal representatives)
shall appoint a successor to such position.  No  Stockholders'
Representative shall resign until a successor representative shall  have been
appointed.

 

 

(v) All  expenses  incurred by Stockholders' Representative in connection
with the performance of  the duties of Stockholders' Representative shall be
borne and paid by Target  Stockholders.

Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable for any error of judgment or
any action  taken, suffered or omitted to be taken on behalf of Target
Stockholders  (or any  of them) pursuant to this Section 12.6(b). Each
Target Stockholder agrees  to  indemnify Stockholders' Representative for,
and hold such Person harmless  against, any loss, liability or expense,
including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
incurred on the part of, or in  connection with, any action or decision taken
or made and on its behalf  by such  Stockholders' Representative.

 

 

**12.7** **Waiver**.  The rights  and remedies of the Parties to this
Agreement are cumulative and not  alternative. Neither the failure nor any
delay by any Party in exercising  any  right, power, or privilege under this
Agreement or the documents referred  to in  this Agreement shall operate as
a waiver of such right, power, or privilege,  and  no single or partial
exercise of any such right, power, or privilege  shall  preclude any other
or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege  or the  exercise of
any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent  permitted by
Applicable Laws, (a) no claim or right arising out of this  Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged  by  one Party, in
whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim  or  right unless
in writing signed by the other applicable Parties, (b) no  waiver  that may
be given by a Party shall be applicable except in the specific  instance 
for which it is given and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party shall  be 
deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the right  of
the  Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice  or  demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred
to in  this  Agreement.

 

 

**12.8** **Entire  Agreement and Modification**.  This  Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements between the Parties with respect  to  its
subject matter and constitutes (along with the documents referred  to in
this  Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the
agreement  between the Parties with respect to its subject matter, except for
the  Confidentiality

 

 

58  

 

Agreement,  which shall remain in effect. This Agreement may not be amended
except  by a  written agreement executed by the Party to be charged with
the  amendment.

 

 

**12.9** **Assignments,  Successors, and No Third-Party Rights**.  No
Party  may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior
consent  of  the other Parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned  or  delayed, except that Buyer may assign any of its rights
under this Agreement  to  any wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer or Buyer
Parent and to Buyer's or Buyer  Parent's lenders for collateral security
purposes. Subject to the preceding  sentence, this Agreement shall apply to,
be binding in all respects upon,  and  inure to the benefit of the
successors and permitted assigns of the Parties.  Nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement shall be construed  to give  any Person other
than the Parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable  right, remedy, or
claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any  provision  of this
Agreement, and this Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions  are
for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties to this Agreement  and 
their successors and assigns.

 

 

**12.10** **Severability**.  If any  provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court  of  competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall  remain in  full force and effect. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or  unenforceable only in part or
degree shall remain in full force and effect  to  the extent not held
invalid or unenforceable.
