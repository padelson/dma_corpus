AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of
June 20, 2000, among COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION, a Nevada corporation
("Parent"), PATRIOT ACQUISITION CORP., a South Carolina corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition"), and POLICY MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS CORPORATION, a South Carolina corporation (the "Company").  
WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Acquisition each
has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
(i) determined that a business combination between Parent and the Company is
fair to their respective shareholders and in the best interests of such
shareholders and (ii) accordingly has approved a Merger of Acquisition with
and into the Company, with the Company as the Surviving Corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, by resolutions duly adopted,
the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Acquisition
have approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE OFFER   Section
1.1 The Offer.  ---------   (a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred
that, had the Offer referred to below been commenced, would give rise to a
right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in
Annex I hereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the public
announcement of the terms of this Agreement, but in no event later than one
week after the date hereof, Acquisition shall (and Parent shall cause
Acquisition to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")), an offer (the "Offer")
for all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Company (individually a "Share" and collectively, the "Shares") at a
price for each Share of $16.00, net to the seller in cash (the "Offer
Price"). The obligation of Acquisition to accept for payment and to pay for
any Shares tendered shall be subject only to (i) the condition that at least
two-thirds of the Shares on a fully- diluted basis, together with the Shares
then owned by Parent and/or Acquisition, (including for purposes of such
calculation all Shares issuable upon exercise of all vested and unvested
Company Stock Options that vest prior to the Effective Time, but excluding
any Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries) be validly
tendered (the "Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the other conditions set forth
in Annex I hereto. Acquisition expressly reserves the right to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms     and conditions
of the Offer; provided, however, that (i) the Minimum Condition may be
amended or waived only with the prior written consent of the Company and (ii)
no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid,
decreases the price per Share or the number of Shares sought in the Offer,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I,
extends the expiration date of the Offer beyond the initial expiration date
of the Offer (except as provided in (b), below) or makes any other change
which is adverse to the holders of the Shares. Subject to satisfaction of the
conditions contained in Annex I, Acquisition shall accept for payment all
Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is permitted to
do so under applicable law and shall pay for such Shares promptly
thereafter.   (b) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire 20
business days following the commencement thereof. If, at a then-scheduled
expiration date, the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied (other
than conditions which are not capable of being satisfied), Acquisition may
extend the Offer from time to time until December 31, 2000, without the
consent of the Company, for such amount of time as is reasonably necessary to
cause such Offer Conditions to be satisfied, no such extension to exceed ten
business days. Without limiting the right of Acquisition to extend the Offer
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, at the request of Company,
Acquisition shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition to, extend the
expiration date of the Offer in one or more periods of not more than ten
business days each (but in no event later than December 31, 2000), if (i) any
of the conditions set forth in Annex I shall not have been satisfied or
waived at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, (ii) such
condition is reasonably capable of being satisfied, and (iii) Company is in
material compliance with all of its covenants in this Agreement, subject to
the cure provisions of paragraph (b)(ii) of Annex I. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Acquisition may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule or regulation of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") applicable to the Offer and (ii) if more
than 80% but less than 90% of the outstanding Shares shall have been validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer as of the scheduled or extended expiration
date, extend the Offer for an aggregate period of not more than five business
days beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise be permitted
under clause (i) of this sentence.   (c) As soon as practicable on the date
the Offer is commenced, Parent and Acquisition shall file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO")
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain as an exhibit or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase (or portions thereof) and
forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement. Parent
and Acquisition agree that they shall cause   2    the Schedule TO, the
Offer to Purchase and all amendments or supplements thereto (which together
constitute the "Offer Documents") to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other Applicable
Laws. Each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company agrees promptly to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and Parent and Acquisition further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. Parent and Acquisition agree to provide in writing the
Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Acquisition or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments.   Section 1.2 Company
Action.  --------------   (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and
represents that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held,
has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in
the best interests of the Company\'s shareholders, (ii) unanimously approved
and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of
the South Carolina Business Corporation Act ("SCBCA") and (iii) subject to
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, as determined by the Board
of Directors in good faith after consultation with counsel, unanimously
resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger by its shareholders. The Company has been
advised that all of its directors who own Shares intend to tender their
Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company will promptly furnish Parent with a
list of its shareholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock
depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most recent practicable
date, and will provide to Parent such additional information (including
updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer. Parent and Acquisition and their agents shall hold
in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, will use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request,
deliver, and will use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to
deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries
from such information then in their possession or control.   (b) As soon as
practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file
with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, as determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith after consultation with counsel, shall reflect the
recommendations of the Company\'s Board of Directors referred to above. The
Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable laws. The Company agrees to
provide Parent and its counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff   3     with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall provide
Parent and its counsel an opportunity to participate in the response of the
Company to such comments, including by participating with the Company or its
counsel in any discussions with the SEC or its staff. The Company, Parent and
Acquisition each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its
counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 prior to its being filed with the SEC.   Section 1.3 Directors. 
---------   (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of any
Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate the
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company\'s
Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the Company\'s Board of Directors (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage
that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Acquisition
(including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares
outstanding, and the Company shall take all action necessary to cause
Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the Company\'s Board of
Directors, including increasing the number of directors, and seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, to the extent
requested by Parent, the Company will also use its best efforts to cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded
up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Board and (ii) each
board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee
thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on
the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to
ensure that at least two of the members of the Company\'s Board of Directors
shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time, be directors of the Company
who were directors of the Company on the date hereof (the
"Continuing Directors"); provided that if there shall be in office fewer than
two Continuing Directors for any reason, the Company\'s Board of Directors
shall cause a person designated by the remaining Continuing Director to fill
such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes
of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the
other directors of the Company then in office shall designate two persons to
fill such vacancies who will not be officers or employees or affiliates of
the Company, Parent or Acquisition or any of their respective Subsidiaries
and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes
of this Agreement.   (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s
designees to the Company\'s Board of Directors shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company
shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its officers and  
4     directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis the information referred to in the
following sentence. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1.   (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s
designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the
approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to
authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the
Company\'s Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company,
including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required
to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment
of this Agreement requiring action by the Company\'s Board of Directors, any
extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by
Parent or Acquisition, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, any consent
or action by the Board of Directors of the Company hereunder and any
other action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects the holders of
Shares (other than Parent or Acquisition).   ARTICLE II  THE MERGER  
Section 2.1 The Merger.  ----------  Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), in accordance
with this Agreement and the SCBCA, Acquisition shall be merged with and into
the Company. Following the Merger, the separate existence of Acquisition
shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation.  
Section 2.2 Effect of the Merger.  --------------------  Upon the
effectiveness of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of the Company and Acquisition in
accordance with the SCBCA and the Merger shall otherwise have the effects set

amended (the "South Carolina Code").   Section 2.3 Closing.  ------- 
Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated previously, and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to effect the Merger set forth herein, the consummation of the Merger
(the "Closing") will take place as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than 10:00 a.m. on the second business day following the satisfaction
or waiver of all the conditions (other than conditions which, by their nature
are to be satisfied at closing, but subject to those conditions) to the
obligations of the parties to effect the Merger set forth herein (the
"Closing Date"), at the offices of Dewey Ballantine LLP, New York, New York
10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to by the parties
hereto.   5      Section 2.4 Consummation of the Merger. 
--------------------------  Upon the Closing, the parties hereto will cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the
State of South Carolina properly executed articles of merger in accordance
with the SCBCA, which shall be effective upon filing or on such later date as
may be agreed by the parties and specified therein (the time of such
effectiveness being the "Effective Time").   Section 2.5 Articles of
Incorporation; By-Laws; Directors and 
-------------------------------------------------  Officers.  --------  
(a) The Articles of Incorporation of Acquisition in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
(except that such Articles of Incorporation shall be amended to provide that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed) until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and as provided by the
SCBCA. The By-Laws of Acquisition in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof, the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation and the SCBCA.   (b) From and after the Effective
Time and until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Surviving Corporation\'s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, (i)
the directors of Acquisition at the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of Acquisition at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.  
Section 2.6 Effect on Capital Stock.  -----------------------   As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of Shares or any shares of capital stock of Acquisition:   (a)
Common Stock of Acquisition.  ---------------------------  Each share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acquisition that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of
Excluded Shares.  -------------------------------  Each Share that is owned
by Acquisition or any subsidiary or affiliate of Acquisition, or by any
Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) or held in the treasury of the Company,
but not Shares held in any Company benefit plan or the Company Stock Employee
Compensation Trust (collectively, the "Excluded Shares") shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.   (c)
Conversion of Shares.  --------------------  Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the highest price paid
per share pursuant to the Offer (the "Merger Consideration"):   6     
Section 2.7 Exchange of Certificates.  ------------------------   (a) As of
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with Chase Mellon Shareholder
Services, LLC, or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent
and Acquisition (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2, through the Exchange
Agent an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.6 (such amount of cash is hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund"), in exchange for outstanding Shares.   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the
"Certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6: (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
representing the proper amount of Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.7, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.  
(c) In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent, may, in its discretion, require
the delivery of a suitable bond and/or indemnity.   (d) Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the shareholders of the Company
for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent as general creditors
for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration.   (e) Neither Parent
nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares for amount of cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   7     
Section 2.8 Stock Options.  -------------   (a) At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a "Company Stock Option or
collectively "Company Stock Options") issued pursuant to any Company stock
option plan (referred to collectively as the "Company Plans"), whether vested
or unvested, shall be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash
payment (less any applicable income or employment tax withholding) payable by
Parent at the Effective Time equal to the Cash-Out Price. For purposes
hereof, the Cash-Out Price shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, and (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company
Stock Option.   (b) Subject to Schedule 2.8(b), the parties will cooperate
to take all reasonable steps necessary to give effect to Section 2.8(a).  
(c) Except as disclosed in writing to Parent prior to the date hereof, the
Company agrees that it will not grant any stock options, stock appreciation
rights, stock units, deferred stock awards or other rights to acquire Shares
or any other interest in Company common stock or any other equity security of
the Company and will not take any action to accelerate the exercisability or
vesting of Company Stock Options and/or permit cash payments to holders of
Company Stock Options with respect to such Company Stock Options.   Section
2.9 Restricted Stock.  ----------------  The Company currently has
outstanding 257,146 shares of restricted stock ("Company Restricted Stock").
At the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or the
holder thereof, be converted into and shall become an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration. The agreements evidencing the grants of such
Company Restricted Stock shall be cancelled.   ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and
warrants to Acquisition that, except as set forth in the Schedules hereto or
the Company SEC Filings:   Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification. 
------------------------------  The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of South
Carolina and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which
the character of its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as
hereinafter defined) on the Company. As used herein, "Material Adverse  
8     Effect" shall mean, with respect to any party, a material adverse
effect on (i) the business, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
other), prospects or operating results of such party and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of such party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement; provided that changes in the general
economy or in the public securities markets shall not, in and of themselves,
constitute a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made
available to Acquisition complete and correct copies of its minute books and
its Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.   Section 3.2 Subsidiaries. 
------------   (a) Except for shares of, or other ownership interests in,
the Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined), the Company does not own of record
or beneficially, directly or indirectly, (i) any shares of outstanding
capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for capital stock of any other corporation or (ii) any participating interest
in any partnership, joint venture or other similar non-corporate
business enterprise. Each Subsidiary is a corporation, partnership or
limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has all requisite corporate, partnership or limited
liability company power and authority to own or lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
character of its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each
Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization is
identified in the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The Company has heretofore made available to Acquisition
complete and correct copies of the minute books and the charter and by-laws
(or other organizational documents) of all Subsidiaries.   (b) All the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each
Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (and no such
shares have been issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights) and
are owned by the Company or by a wholly- owned Subsidiary of the Company,
free and clear of any liens, claims, charges, encumbrances or adverse claims
("Liens"), and there are no proxies outstanding or restrictions on voting
with respect to any such shares.   For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation or other business entity of which
securities or other ownership interests having ordinary voting power to elect
a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar
functions are at the time owned by the Company and/or one or more other
Subsidiaries.   Section 3.3 Authority Relative to Agreements. 
--------------------------------  The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject (if
required) to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by a two-thirds vote
of the stockholders of the Company (the "Company Stockholder Approval"), to
perform its obligations hereunder. The   9     execution, delivery and

actions, the outcome of which would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as publicly disclosed by the Company in

loss or denial of such tax-favored status; and   (iii) The consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not create or otherwise
result in any liability with respect to any Non-U.S. Plan.   Section 3.18
Environmental Matters.  ---------------------  Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries conducts its business and operations in material compliance with
all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations
relating to pollution or protection of human health or the environment
(collectively, "Environmental Laws"), and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice of any claim, action, suit, proceeding,
hearing or investigation,   19     based on or related to the
manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport or handling, or the emission, discharge, release or threatened
release into the environment, of any pollutant, contaminant, hazardous or
toxic material, waste, or any other substance regulated by any Environmental
Law (collectively, an "Environmental Event") by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the outcome of which could reasonably be expected to have
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no notice of any
material Environmental Event was given to any person or entity that occupied
any of the premises occupied by or used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the date such premises were so occupied. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any subsidiary has disposed of or placed on or in any
property or facility used in its business any waste materials, hazardous
materials, hazardous substances or any other substance regulated by any
Environmental Law in violation of law, which would have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.   Section 3.19 Customer Relationships. 
----------------------  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has, since January 1, 1999, lost, or been notified
that it will lose or suffer diminution in its relationship with any material
customer (defined as the top fifteen (15) customers measured by revenue),
and, to the best knowledge of the Company, no representative of any material
customer has notified the Company or any Subsidiary that, in the event of a
change of ownership of the Company such as contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company or any Subsidiary would, lose or suffer diminution in its
relationship with any such material customer.   Section 3.20 Certain
Transactions.  --------------------  Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Filings or as set forth on Schedule 3.20, there are no material transactions
or arrangements between the Company or any Subsidiary and (i) any director or
executive officer of the Company or (ii) any other person or entity
controlling or under common control with the Company.   Section 3.21 Title
to Properties; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances. 
------------------------------------------------------  Except as reflected
in the most recent balance sheet (including any related notes thereto)
contained in the Company SEC Reports, as set forth in Schedule 3.21 or with
respect to assets disposed of since December 31, 1999 in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practice, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has good and valid title to all its owned assets and properties,
in each case free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, security interests
or other encumbrances, other than (x) liens for taxes not yet delinquent or
(y) security interests securing indebtedness not in default for the purchase
price of or lease rental payments on property purchased or leased under
capital lease arrangements in the ordinary course of business or (z) such
imperfections and irregularities of title or Liens as do not affect the use
of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise
materially impair business operations at such properties, in either case in
such a manner as to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Any real
property and buildings held under lease by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases,
and there is not, to the knowledge of the Company, under any such leases, any
existing material default or event of default by any party thereto (or  
20     event which with notice of lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a material default), with such exceptions as are not material and
would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made
of such property and buildings.   Section 3.22 Insurance.  --------- 
Schedule 3.22 sets forth a list of all material insurance policies of the
Company and the Subsidiaries (the "Insurance Policies"). The Insurance
Policies are in full force and effect and provide insurance in such amounts
and against such risks as are customary for companies of similar size in the
same business as the Company and the Subsidiaries. All premiums with respect
to the Insurance Policies have been paid, and no notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any such Insurance Policy. With
respect to each of the litigation matters set forth on Schedule 3.12, no
carrier of any Insurance Policy has asserted any denial of coverage. The
Insurance Policies will remain in full force and effect and will not in any
way be affected by, or terminate or lapse by reason of, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 3.23 State Takeover Statutes;
Certain Charter Provisions. 
---------------------------------------------------  Prior to the date
hereof, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and such approval
is sufficient to render inapplicable to the Merger the provisions of Title 35
of the South Carolina Code and the provisions of Article 9(j) of the
Company\'s Articles of Incorporation.   Section 3.24 Opinion of Financial
Advisor.  ----------------------------  The Company has received the opinion
of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, dated June 20, 2000, substantially
to the effect that the consideration to be received in the Offer and the
Merger by the holders of Shares is fair to such holders from a financial
point of view, a copy of which opinion has been (or promptly will be)
delivered to Parent.   Section 3.25 Brokers.  -------  No person is
entitled to any brokerage or finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and as a result of any action taken by or on behalf of the Company,
other than Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation pursuant to an engagement
letter dated March 17, 2000, a copy of which has been furnished to
Parent.   Section 3.26 Termination of Existing Agreement. 
---------------------------------  The Amended and Restated Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of April 27, 2000 ("WCAS Agreement") by and among
Politic Acquisition Corp. ("Politic") and the Company and any other
related agreements have been duly terminated without liability or expense of
the Company other than payment of the fee and expenses referred to at
Section 5.05(b) thereof.   Section 3.27 Certain Business Practices. 
--------------------------  Except where the amount of losses, penalties,
claims and damages that could reasonably be incurred as a result of such
conduct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, none of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any
directors, officers, agents or employees of the Company   21     or
any of its subsidiaries has (i) used any funds for unlawful
contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to
political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic
government officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties
or campaigns or violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
of 1977, as amended, or (iii) made any other unlawful payment.   ARTICLE

lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any asset of

the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. No consent,

representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made

Stockholder Approval is required by law, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable following the expiration of the Offer, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting")
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, as determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith after consultation with counsel, the Company shall,
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that the
Company Stockholder Approval be given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Parent or Acquisition shall acquire beneficial ownership of at least 90% of
the outstanding Shares, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the merger of Acquisition and the Company to become effective
as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a

as promptly as practicable. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the Merger. The Company shall give Parent an opportunity
to comment on any correspondence with the SEC or its staff or any
proposed material to be included in the Proxy Statement prior to transmission
to the SEC or its staff and shall not transmit any such material to which
Parent reasonably objects. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting
there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and
mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement.   (c) Parent
agrees to cause all Shares owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to be
voted in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval.   Section 5.3 Access to
Information.  ---------------------   (a) The Company shall, and shall
cause the Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents to, afford, from the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the officers, employees, representatives and agents of
Acquisition reasonable access during regular business hours to its officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, records and workpapers, and shall
promptly furnish Acquisition all financial, operating   26     and
other information and data as Acquisition, through its officers, employees or
agents, may reasonably request.   (b) Except as required by law, Acquisition
shall hold, and will cause its respective officers, employees,
representatives and agents to hold, any confidential information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement between the Company and Parent.   (c) No investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 or belief contemplated by Section 5.6(c) shall affect, add
to or subtract from any representations or warranties of the parties hereto
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto to effect the
Merger.   (d) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the
Company shall furnish to Parent, within 30 business days after the end of
each calendar month (commencing with June 2000), an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the party furnishing such information as of the end of such
month and the related consolidated statements of earnings and shareholders\'
equity (deficit) for such period, and, within 45 business days after the end
of each calendar quarter, a statement of cash flows for the quarter then
ended, each prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in conformity with the practices consistently applied by the
Company with respect to its monthly and quarterly financial statements. All
the foregoing shall be in accordance with the books and records of the
Company and shall fairly present its consolidated financial position (taking
into account the differences between the monthly and quarterly statements
prepared by the Company in conformity with its past practices) as of the last
day of the period then ended.   Section 5.4 Further Assurances. 
------------------  Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws
and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including, without
limitation, (i) cooperating in the preparation and filing of the Offer
Documents, any filings that may be required under the HSR Act or similar
governmental legal requirements, and any amendments to any thereof; (ii)
obtaining consents of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary,
proper or advisable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (iii) contesting any legal proceeding relating to the Merger;
and (iv) executing any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company agree to use all reasonable efforts to
cause the Effective Time to occur as soon as practicable after the
shareholder vote with respect to the Merger. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party hereto shall
take all such necessary action. Parent shall cause Acquisition to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, if requested by any governmental authority, Parent and the
Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold  
27     separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to its or its subsidiaries ability
to retain or operate, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent, the Company or their respective subsidiaries, provided that (i) any
such action is conditioned on the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and
(ii) such action would not be material in the context of the Company and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole.   Section 5.5 Inquiries and
Negotiations.  --------------------------   (a) In connection with any
Alternative Transaction (as hereinafter defined), from the date hereof until
the termination of this Agreement, the Company, the Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and other agents
will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate any discussions,
submissions of proposals or offers or negotiations with, or continue any pre-
existing discussions with, or participate in any negotiations or discussions
with, or provide any information or data of any nature whatsoever to, or
otherwise cooperate in any other way with, or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by, any person, corporation,
entity or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other
than Parent and its affiliates, representatives and agents (each, a "Third
Party"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by the fiduciary duties
of the Company\'s Board of Directors as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors after consultation with counsel, and if solely in connection
with a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or a proposal that is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then but only then may the
Company take any of the foregoing actions. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any
information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations, including
discussions or negotiations commenced prior to the date hereof, are sought to
be initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of an Alternative
Transaction, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity
of the Third Party and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or
the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent
informed, on a current basis, of all material developments affecting the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers or the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with not less than two business
days\' notice prior to the execution by the Company of any definitive
agreement with respect to any Alternative Transaction or any public
announcement relating to the approval of any Alternative Transaction. Prior
to furnishing any non-public information to, or entering into negotiations or
discussions with, any Third Party, the Company shall obtain an executed
confidentiality agreement from such Third Party on terms substantially the
same as, or no less favorable to the Company in any material respect than,
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided such agreement
need not contain a "standstill" provision or otherwise restrict the ability
of the Third Party to make a proposal to the Company\'s Board of Directors.
The Company shall not release any Third Party from, or waive any provision
of, any such confidentiality agreement or any other confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Company is a party, other than any such
provision that would prevent or otherwise restrict the ability of a Third
Party to make a proposal to the Company\'s Board of Directors. As of the date
hereof, the Company shall cease, and shall use best efforts to cause the  
28     Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees,
representatives and other agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries, to
cease, all discussions, negotiations and communications with all Third
Parties and demand the immediate return of all confidential information
previously provided to Third Parties, except with respect to a Third Party
which has made a proposal as to which the Board of Directors has made the
determinations contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 5.5(a). As
used in this Agreement, the term "Alternative Transaction" shall mean any (i)
merger, consolidation, recapitalization, tender or exchange offer, debt
restructuring or similar transaction involving the Company or its Shares,
(ii) the sale of more than 25% of the common stock or other capital stock of
the Company or (iii) sale of assets (including stock of subsidiaries)
representing more than 25% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As used in this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any
bona fide proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities, more than two-thirds of the Shares then
outstanding or all or substantially all the consolidated assets of the
Company and otherwise on terms which the Company Board by a majority vote
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial
adviser of nationally recognized reputation and with the advice of such
financial adviser as to the financial ability of the potential acquiror) to
be more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders than the Merger.   (b) If
a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall pay to
Parent or its designated beneficiary within two business days following such
Payment Event, (i) a fee of $19 million in cash, plus (ii) all documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Parent, including, without limitation,
financing fees, fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers
and other advisors, filling fees and printing expenses up to a maximum of $5
million. In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated for any other
reason and the Company shall have failed to comply with or perform, or shall
have breached, in any material respect, any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designated
beneficiary, within two business days following such termination, the fees
and expenses referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence; provided
that such fees and expenses shall not be so payable if Parent shall have
failed to comply with or perform, or shall have breached, in any material
respect, any of its covenants or agreements contained herein.   (c) For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Payment Event" shall mean (w) the
termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d); (x) the
Company\'s entering into a written agreement with respect to an Alternative
Transaction, as contemplated by Section 7.1(c)(i), or the termination of this
Agreement by the Company in connection with the commencement of a tender
offer by a Third Party, pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i); (y) within 12 months
of the date of termination of this Agreement (other than by reason of
Parent\'s failure to comply with or perform, or its breach of, in any
material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein), the
agreement of the Company to enter into, or the consummation of, a transaction
that is the subject of an inquiry, proposal or offer that is an Alternative
Transaction that was publicly announced or submitted to the Company prior to
the termination of this Agreement; or (z) the termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and within 12 months of the date of
termination of this Agreement (other than by reason of  
29     Parent\'s failure to comply with or perform, or its breach of, in
any material respect, any of its agreements or covenants contained herein),
the Company agrees to enter into, or consummates, a transaction that is an
Alternative Transaction.   (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 5.5 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 5.5, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the fee or fees and expenses set forth in

and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Acquisition\'s rights to extend
and amend the Offer (subject to the provisions of this Agreement), and
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) relating to Acquisition\'s obligation to pay for or return tendered
shares after termination of the Offer, Acquisition shall not be required to
accept for payment or pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, may
delay the acceptance for payment of any Shares pursuant to Section 1.1(b) of
this Agreement, may extend the Offer by one or more times, in all cases
subject to Section 1.1(b), and may terminate the Offer at any time after the
expiration date thereof, subject to the right of the Company pursuant to
Section 1.1(b) to request that Acquisition extend the Offer, if (i) less than
two-thirds of the outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis (including for
purposes of such calculation all Shares issuable upon exercise of all vested
Company Stock Options and unvested Company Stock Options that vest prior to
the Effective Time, but excluding any Shares held by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries) have been tendered pursuant to the Offer by the expiration

HSR Act or similar statutes or regulations of foreign jurisdictions has
not expired or terminated; (iii) all necessary consents and approvals from
all Governmental Entities shall not have been obtained on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to Parent; or (iv) at any time after the
date of this Agreement, and before acceptance for payment of any Shares, any
of the following events shall occur and be continuing:   (a) there shall
have been any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order
or injunction promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed
applicable to the Offer or the Merger by any domestic or foreign court or
other Governmental Entity which directly or indirectly (i) prohibits, or
makes illegal, the acceptance for payment, payment for or purchase of Shares
or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) renders Acquisition unable to accept for
payment, pay for or purchase some or all of the Shares or (iii) imposes
material limitations on the ability of Parent effectively to exercise full
rights of ownership of the Shares, including the right to vote the Shares
purchased by it on all matters properly presented to the Company\'s
shareholders, except in each case as contemplated by the final sentence of
Section 5.4 of the Merger Agreement;   (b) (i) the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall not be true and
correct (except to the extent that the aggregate of all breaches thereof
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company) at the date hereof
and as of the consummation of the Offer with the same effect as if made at
and as of the consummation of the Offer (except to the extent such
representations specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case such
representations shall be true and correct as of such earlier date, and in any
event, subject to the foregoing Material Adverse Effect qualification), (ii)
the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects its
covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement, which failure to
perform has not been cured within ten business days after the giving of
written notice to the Company, or (iii) except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Filings or Schedule 3.8, there shall have occurred since March 31, 2000
any events or changes which     constitute a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, other than as a result of the announcement or expectation of the
Merger;   (c) (1) a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of
the outstanding Shares is commenced, and the Company Board, within ten

either fails to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer by its shareholders or takes no position with respect to the acceptance

14D-9), its recommendation of the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger, or
recommended another proposal or offer, or the Company Board, shall have
resolved to do any of the foregoing; or   (e) this Agreement shall have
terminated in accordance with its terms,  which in the good faith judgment
of Parent, in any such case, and regardless of the circumstances (including
any action or inaction by Parent) giving rise to such condition makes it
inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or the acceptance for payment of or
payment for the Shares.  The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit
of Parent and Acquisition and may be waived by Parent and Acquisition, in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of
Parent and Acquisition. The failure by Parent and Acquisition at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.        '
