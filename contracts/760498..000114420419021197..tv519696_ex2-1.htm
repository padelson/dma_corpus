(c) each share of BancFirst capital stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued
and outstanding and will be unaffected by the Share Exchange.

stockholders that have properly perfected their right of appraisal within the
meaning of Section 10.351 _et seq_. of the TBOC (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, the Paying Agent shall mail or deliver to each holder of record of
shares of Pegasus Common Stock a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected only upon delivery of Pegasus Certificates to
the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Pegasus and BancFirst reasonably specify, including, without
limitation, a release by each Pegasus shareholder of all claims against
Pegasus (other than claims arising under this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents), and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Pegasus Certificates in exchange for the Acquisition Consideration Per Share.
Upon surrender of an Pegasus Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, at the Closing the
holder of such Pegasus Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (x) the Acquisition Consideration Per Share, _multiplied by_ (y) the
number of shares of Pegasus Common Stock represented by the certificate
so surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ (which amount
shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent), and Pegasus Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 3.3_ , each Pegasus Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Acquisition Consideration Per Share with respect to the shares of Pegasus
Common Stock represented by such Pegasus Certificate.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the payment procedures described in _Section
3.3(b)(i)_ above, in the event that a holder of Pegasus Certificates
surrenders such Pegasus Certificates and a properly executed letter of
transmittal evidencing such holder's election to surrender such shares
pursuant to this Agreement, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may
reasonably require, to the Paying Agent at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, then, immediately following the Closing, BancFirst shall
cause the Paying Agent to deliver to such holder of such Pegasus Certificates
an amount equal to the amount payable to such shareholder pursuant to
_Section 3.3(b)(i)_ by, at the option of such holder (A) delivery of a bank
cashier's check payable to such holder, (B) a direct deposit into such
holder's account at Pegasus, or (C) subject to the holder being entitled to
receive not less than $100,000 pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
3.3(b)_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such holder.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Pegasus Common Stock_. The
Acquisition Consideration Per Share paid upon surrender of shares of Pegasus
Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Pegasus Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of Pegasus of the shares of Pegasus Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which were
evidenced by Pegasus Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, Pegasus
Certificates are presented to BancFirst for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

(d) _Lost or Stolen Certificate_. In the event that any Pegasus
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue and pay the Acquisition Consideration Per Share to such shareholder in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, together with such other
documents required under _Section 3.3(b)(i)_ ; _provided_ , that the Paying
Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
cash, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to
submit to the Paying Agent a bond in form and substance satisfactory to the
Paying Agent in an amount not to exceed the aggregate Acquisition
Consideration the owner will receive, or an indemnification agreement in a
form acceptable to BancFirst, whereby such shareholder agrees to indemnify
BancFirst, Pegasus and the Paying Agent against any claim that may be made
against them with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Fund; Limit of Liability_. Any portion of the
cash funds deposited in a segregated account pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ ,
which remains undistributed to the shareholders of Pegasus for six months
after the Effective Time may be transferred by the Paying Agent from such
segregated account to BancFirst's general operating accounts. Neither
BancFirst, the Paying Agent nor Pegasus shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Pegasus Common Stock for any portion of such cash funds that may be
later delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(f) _Withholding_. The Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Pegasus Common Stock such amounts as BancFirst is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to making such payment under the Code, or
any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by BancFirst, such amounts shall be remitted to
the appropriate tax authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Pegasus Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
BancFirst.

  



  

(g) _Liens and Encumbrances_. Any of the shares of Pegasus Common
Stock that are subject to liens and encumbrances shall not be entitled to
receive any portion of the Acquisition Consideration unless BancFirst receives
evidence satisfactory to it that such liens or encumbrances have been or will
be released upon receipt of the applicable portion of the Acquisition
Consideration.

  



  

3.4 _Final Dividend Paying Agent_. If a Final Dividend has been
declared prior to the Closing (based on the Pegasus Tangible
Shareholders Equity as of the Valuation Date) but remains unpaid immediately
prior to the Closing, Pegasus, in conjunction with the Closing, shall (a)
deliver to BancFirst a shareholders list as of the Record Date for the payment
of the Final Dividend, which shareholders list shall include those matters
specified in _Section 2.6(a)(ix)_ , and (b) deposit with BancFirst immediately
available funds in an amount equal to the Final Dividend. Subject to receipt
of the shareholders list and said funds, BancFirst shall act as the paying
agent for the Final Dividend. In such capacity, BancFirst shall mail or
deliver a check to each Pegasus shareholder as of the Record Date, as
reflected on the shareholders list described above, in an amount equal to that
portion of the Final Dividend due such shareholder.

4.15 _Insurance_. Pegasus is insured, and during each of the past
three calendar years has been insured, for reasonable amounts with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies against such risks as
companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with good
business practice, customarily be insured and has maintained all insurance
required by applicable laws, regulations and agreements to which Pegasus is a
party. _Schedule 4.15_ identifies all insurance policies maintained by Pegasus
as of the date hereof and any claims pending thereunder. All of the policies
and bonds maintained by Pegasus are in full force and effect and
shall continue in full force and effect through the Closing Date, and all
claims thereunder have been filed in a due and timely manner, and no such
claim has been denied. Pegasus has not been notified that its fidelity or
insurance coverage will not be renewed by the carrier(s) on substantially the
same terms as its existing coverage except for terms which may be included in
the policies identified in _Schedule 4.15_.

  



  

4.16 _Properties_. All real and personal property owned by Pegasus or
presently used by it in its business are in condition (ordinary wear and
tear excepted) sufficient to carry on the business of Pegasus in the ordinary
course of business consistent with its past practices. Pegasus has good and
indefeasible title free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges,
defaults or equities (other than equities of redemption under applicable

properties sold by Pegasus in the ordinary course of business, except (i)
liens for current Taxes not yet due or payable, (ii) pledges to secure
deposits and other liens incurred in the ordinary course of its banking
business, and (iii) such imperfections of title, easements and encumbrances,
if any, as are not material in character, amount or extent. All real and
personal property which is material to the business of Pegasus and leased or
licensed by Pegasus is held pursuant to leases or licenses which are valid
and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and such leases or
licenses will not terminate or lapse prior to the Closing.  _Schedule 4.16_

used in the conduct of its business.

transactions, nor are there any agreements or understandings, with any
directors, officers or employees of Pegasus or any person or entity

Pegasus, including, without limitation, any transactions, arrangements or
understandings relating to the purchase or sale of goods or services, the
lending of monies or the sale, lease or use of any assets of Pegasus, except
for (i) current salary and business expense advances consistent with past
practices, (ii) loans that have been entered into in the ordinary course of
business on terms no more favorable to such Person than if the loan had been
entered into on an arms' length basis pursuant to normal commercial terms and
conditions and in compliance with applicable law, and (iii) such Person's
deposit accounts at Pegasus.

4.18 _Loans_. Each loan on the books and records of Pegasus,
including, without limitation, unfunded portions of outstanding lines of
credit, loan commitments and letters of credit, (a) was made and has been
serviced in all material respects in accordance with Pegasus' loan policy or
exceptions approved by loan committee or Pegasus' board of directors at the
time such loan was made or extended as applicable, in the ordinary course of
business, (b) is evidenced in all material respects by appropriate and
sufficient documentation, (c), to the Knowledge of Pegasus, constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights and to general
equity principles, and (d) is not subject to any known or threatened defense,
offsets or counterclaims that might be asserted against Pegasus. Although no
representation or warranty is being made as to the sufficiency of collateral
securing or the collectability of such loans, the credit files of Pegasus
contain all material information known to Pegasus that is reasonably required
to evaluate, in accordance with generally prevailing practices in the banking
industry, the collectibility of Pegasus' loan portfolio. All extensions of
credit made to any insider of Pegasus (within the meaning of such terms in
Regulation O of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) have
been made by Pegasus in an arms-length manner made on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the
time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve more
than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
_Schedule 4.18_ lists all internal and examiner classified loans and watch
listed loans and OREO as of the most recent month end.

  



  

4.19 _Intellectual Property_. Pegasus owns all right, title and
interest in, to and under, free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance
of any kind, and has the valid and enforceable right to use and fully and
completely assign, transfer and convey (or have a valid, written and
enforceable license to) all computer software and programs of any kind or
nature (including, without limitation, any and all object code, source code,
firmware, program and/or programming tools), currently used or planned to be
used in its business or otherwise reasonably necessary to carry on its
business. The activities, products and services of Pegasus have not and do
not infringe upon, misappropriate, dilute (in the case of trademarks) or
otherwise violate, or constitute the unauthorized use of the intellectual
property of any other Person. There are no written or, to the Knowledge of
Pegasus, oral allegations, threats or claims, and there are no lawsuits
pending or, to the Knowledge of Pegasus, threatened, in any case, alleging
that any of Pegasus' activities, products or services infringe upon,
misappropriate, dilute (in the case of trademarks) or otherwise violate, or
constitute the unauthorized use of, any other Person's intellectual property.

Pegasus or any of the written information or documents which have been
furnished by Pegasus to BancFirst pursuant to this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby contains or will contain any untrue statement

6.7 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) Until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date of termination
of this Agreement, neither Pegasus nor any of its Affiliates or agents will,
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or participate in negotiations with
any Person other than BancFirst with respect to the disposition of any of the
equity securities of Pegasus or any option with respect thereto, or the merger
or acquisition of Pegasus with another Person, or any disposition of all or
any significant portion of the assets of Pegasus not in the ordinary course
of business, or any similar transaction (each, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "),
nor shall Pegasus or any of its Affiliates or agents provide any information
concerning Pegasus with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that this _Section 6.7(a)_ shall not prohibit Pegasus or its Board of
Directors from (A) furnishing information regarding Pegasus to, entering into
a customary confidentiality agreement with, or entering into discussions with
any Person in response to a Superior Proposal submitted by such Person (and
not withdrawn), (B) taking the actions described in _Section 6.6(c)_  as
permitted thereby, (C) recommending a Superior Proposal to Pegasus'
shareholders, or (D) terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_
in order to immediately thereafter enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, if in the case of either (A), (B), (C) or
(D), (1) neither Pegasus nor any of its Affiliates or agents shall have
violated any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.7_, (2) the
Board of Directors of Pegasus concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary in order for the
Board of Directors of Pegasus to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
Pegasus' shareholders under applicable law, (3)(x) at least two Business Days
prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person, Pegasus gives BancFirst
written notice of the identity of such Person and of Pegasus' intention to
furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person, and (y) Pegasus receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all written and oral information furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of Pegasus, and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
information to such Person, Pegasus furnishes such information to BancFirst.
Pegasus will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.7(a)_ by any
officer or director of Pegasus or any investment banker, attorney or other
advisor or representative of Pegasus shall be deemed to be a breach by Pegasus
of this _Section 6.7(a)_.

  



  

(b) In addition to the obligations of Pegasus set forth in _Section
6.7(a)_ , Pegasus shall, as promptly as practicable, advise BancFirst orally
and in writing of any request received by Pegasus for information which
Pegasus reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry received by Pegasus with respect to, or
which Pegasus reasonably believes would lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Pegasus will keep BancFirst informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including, without limitation,
material amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry.

accrued) the following expenses prior to the Effective Time: (a) all Pegasus
Transaction Expenses incurred up to the Effective Time, and (b) any other fees
or expenses required to be paid prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. All such fees and expenses shall be paid and
fully expensed or accrued and reflected on Pegasus' books for all purposes as
of the Valuation Date. The fees and expenses referred to in this _Section
6.8_ shall be taken into account in the calculation of the Acquisition
Consideration.

  



  

6.9 _Termination of Stock Option Plans_. On or prior to the Closing,
Pegasus shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Stock Option Plans
and satisfy all of its obligations thereunder, including, without limitation,

Effective Time, Pegasus shall promptly supplement or amend any materials
previously disclosed and delivered to BancFirst pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any matter arising after the date hereof which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in writing to BancFirst or which is necessary to
correct any information in such prior disclosure which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby;  _provided_ , no such supplement or amendment shall be
deemed to have modified the representations, warranties and covenants for the
purpose of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
hereof have been satisfied.

parties hereto determines that a condition to its respective obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or
prior to 120 days after the date of this Agreement, it will promptly notify
the other party or parties. Each party will promptly inform the other party or

writing of BancFirst and Pegasus;

  



  

   

 | 33 | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) at any time on or prior to the Closing, by BancFirst in writing
if Pegasus has, or by Pegasus in writing if BancFirst has, breached (i) any
material covenant or undertaking contained herein, or (ii) any representation
or warranty contained herein in any material respect if such breach is
incapable of cure or has not been cured within 30 days following written
notice of such breach to the breaching party or the Closing;

  



  

(c) at any time, by BancFirst or Pegasus in writing, if any of the
applications for prior approval referred to in _Section 5.2(c)_  hereof are
denied or, in the case of BancFirst, are approved in a manner which does not
satisfy the requirements of _Section 7.1(b)_ hereof, and the time period for
appeals and requests for reconsideration has run, unless the failure of such
occurrence shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate to
perform or observe in any material respect its agreements set forth herein to
be performed or observed by such party at or before the Closing;

  



  

(d) by Pegasus prior to a vote of the shareholders of Pegasus on the
Agreement if, after receiving the Superior Proposal and the absence of any
prior breach of the provisions of _Section 6.7_ of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of Pegasus determines in good faith, after consulting with
outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Pegasus under applicable law;
_provided_ , that Pegasus may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(d)_ until two Business Days have elapsed following delivery to
BancFirst of written notice of such determination by Pegasus (which notice

Proposal);

  



  

(e) by BancFirst or Pegasus in writing, if the Closing has not
occurred by the close of business on September 30, 2019; _provided_ , that
this right to terminate shall not be available to any party whose failure to
perform an obligation under this Agreement has been the direct and principal
cause of, or directly and principally resulted in, the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by such date.

  



  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect,
except that (i) _Article IX_ in its entirety shall survive any such
termination; and (ii) a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not
relieve the breaching party from liability for any grossly negligent or
willful breach of any covenant, undertaking, representation or warranty
giving rise to such termination.

  



  

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Pegasus pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_ hereof or the Board of Directors withdraws its
recommendation to approve this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.6(b)_ ,

termination fee in the amount of $4,000,000 (the " _Pegasus Termination Fee_

(c) If the Pegasus Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ , it shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by BancFirst within two (2) Business Days after
termination of this Agreement. Pegasus acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that without such agreements BancFirst
would not have entered into this Agreement, and that such amounts do not
constitute a penalty. If Pegasus fails to promptly pay BancFirst the amounts
due under this _Section 8.2_ within the time period specified herein, Pegasus
shall pay all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by
BancFirst in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit,
taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest from
the date due at the prime rate of interest, as adjusted from time to time,
reported in the "Money Rates" section of _The Wall Street Journal_.

  



  

8.3 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. All
representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall expire on, and be terminated and
extinguished at, the Effective Time other than covenants that, by their
terms, are to be performed after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the covenants set forth in the Retention Agreements shall survive
until the expiration of the applicable periods specified therein.

  



  

8.4 _Waiver_. Each party hereto by written instrument may at any
time extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party hereto and may waive (a) any inaccuracies of
the other party in the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto, (b) compliance with any
of the covenants, undertakings or agreements of the other party or, to the
extent permitted by law, satisfaction of any of the conditions precedent to
its obligations contained herein, or (c) the performance by the other party
of any of its obligations set forth herein.

(a) vote any of the Shares, or cause or permit any of the Shares to

regulations thereunder (collectively, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) of more than a
15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Pegasus or any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially
owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of Pegasus, or
any acquisition, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving Pegasus pursuant to which the shareholders of Pegasus immediately

hereof or are subsequently acquired, except (i) for transfers by will or by
operation of law (in which case this Voting Agreement shall bind the
transferee), (ii) for gifts by the undersigned, subject to the donee expressly
assuming the obligations of the undersigned arising under this Voting
Agreement; (iii) for sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions
necessitated by hardship with the prior written consent of BancFirst and
subject to the transferee expressly assuming the obligations of
the undersigned arising under this Voting Agreement; or (iv) as BancFirst may
otherwise agree in writing.

  



  

As used herein, the term "Control" means (A) the ability to direct the voting
of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a person having
ordinary voting power in the election of directors or in the election of any
other body having similar functions, or (B) the ability to direct the
management and policies of a person, whether through ownership of securities,
through any contract, arrangement or understanding or otherwise.

  



  

3. The undersigned represents that (a) he or she has the complete and unrestricted power and the unqualified right to enter into and perform the terms of this Voting Agreement and that this Voting Agreement does not conflict with the terms of any other agreement, understanding or document to which he or she is a party; (b) this Voting Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement with respect to the undersigned, enforceable against the undersigned in accordance with its terms; and (c) he or she has either sole and unrestricted voting power with respect to the Shares or such voting power is shared with another person entering into an agreement substantially identical to this Voting Agreement.

4. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Voting Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Voting Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Voting Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Voting Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

5. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Voting Agreement were not performed by the undersigned in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that BancFirst shall be entitled to seek such an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Voting Agreement by the undersigned and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which BancFirst is entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

6. This Voting Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement. A facsimile or other electronic transmission of a signed counterpart of this Voting Agreement shall be sufficient to bind the party or parties whose signature(s) appear thereon.

  



  

7. This Voting Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to agreements made and entirely to be performed within such jurisdiction except to the extent federal law may be applicable. If any provision hereof is deemed unenforceable by a court of law, the enforceability of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected.

  



  

8. It is a condition to the effectiveness of this Voting Agreement that the Share Exchange Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by the parties thereto.
