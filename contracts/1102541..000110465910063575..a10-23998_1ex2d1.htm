(a) _Conversion of Company Shares in the Merger_. At and as of the Effective
Time, each Company Share (other than any Dissenting Shares) that is issued and

any such Company Share (each, a " _Stock Certificate_ ") shall instead only
evidence the right to receive such Merger Consideration in accordance with the

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Shares in the Merger_. At and as of the
Effective Time, each share of the common stock of Merger Sub that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and each stock
certificate that theretofore evidenced ownership of any share of the common
stock of Merger Sub shall instead, from and after the Effective Time, evidence
only ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Effect of the Merger on Company Options and Restricted Stock_. At and as
of the Effective Time: (i) each vested and unvested Company Option that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an
exercise price per Company Share that is less than the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable after the

(A) the excess of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise
price per Company Share of such Company Option, and (B) the number of Company
Shares subject to such Company Option (collectively, the " _In-The-Money
Option Exercise Payments_ "); (ii) each vested and unvested Company Option

an exercise price per Company Share that is equal to or greater than the Per
Share Merger Consideration, other than any such options held by the Companys

shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a
cash payment in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (A) $0.01 and (B)
the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option, (collectively,
the " _Underwater Option Exercise Payments,_ " and, collectively, with the In-
The-Money Option Exercise Payments, the " _Option Exercise Payments_ "), and
(iii) each share of vested or unvested Company restricted stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without further
action by the holder thereof, become fully vested and converted into and
represent the right to the Merger Consideration with respect to such Company
Share (the " _Restricted Share Payment_ "). At and as of the Effective Time,
each agreement or other document that theretofore evidenced any Company Option
or Restricted Share shall instead only evidence the right to receive the
Option Exercise Payment with respect to such Company Option, or the Restricted
Share Payment with respect to such Restricted Shares, and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time,
(i) no holder of a Company Option shall have any rights in respect thereof
other than to receive payment of the Option Exercise Payment with respect to
such holders Company Options as set forth in this _Section 2.3(c),_ and (ii)
no holder of Restricted Shares shall have any rights in respect thereof other
than to receive payment of the Restricted Share Payment with respect to such
holders Restricted Shares as set forth in this _Section 2.3(c)_. The
Company shall (i) as required under the terms and conditions of each Company

holder that the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation will not assume any

optionholders to sign option cancellation agreements in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company prior to Closing.

Time: (i) each Company Warrant that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and has an

 



      
 

 



 

exercise price per Company Share that is less than the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, a cash payment in an aggregate amount equal to the product of
(A) the excess of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise
price per Company Share of such Company Warrant, and (B) the number of Company
Shares subject to such Company Warrant (collectively, the " _Warrant Exercise
Payments_ "); and (ii) each Company Warrant that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise per Company Share
that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
automatically be cancelled, without any consideration paid therefor, as of the
Effective Time. At and as of the Effective Time, each warrant agreement or
other document that theretofore evidenced any Company Warrant shall instead
only evidence the right to receive the Warrant Exercise Payment (if any) with
respect to such Company Warrant in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, no holder of a Company
Warrant shall have any rights in respect thereof other than to receive payment
of the Warrant Exercise Payment (if any) with respect to such holders Company
Warrants as set forth in this _Section 2.3(d)_. ** **The Company shall, as
required under the terms and conditions of each Company Warrant, send a
written notice to each holder of Company Warrant prior to the Closing Date
describing the effect of the Merger on the Company Warrant (as set forth above
in this _Section 2.3(d)_). The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to get all warrant holders to sign warrant cancellation agreements in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company prior to the
Closing and/or to amend the agreements relating to the Company Warrants to
terminate all the Company Warrants as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement: (i) the Paying Agent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
or otherwise deliverable to any holder of Company Shares, Company Options or
Company Warrants under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law; and (ii) to the extent
that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable
holder of Company Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants in respect to
which such deduction and withholding were made by the Paying Agent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.

 



 

 **2.4** ** ****_Appraisal Rights_** **.** Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any Company Share that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Company Stockholder
that has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto pursuant to
Section 228 of the DGCL and that has otherwise properly perfected such Company
Stockholders right to appraisal for such Company Share in accordance with the
DGCL (and who has not effectively withdrawn nor lost such Company
Stockholders right to such appraisal) (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, but shall instead be converted into
only such rights as are granted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
DGCL; _provided, however_ , that any Company Share held by a Company
Stockholder who, after the Effective Time, withdraws such Company
Stockholders demand or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Company
Stockholders right of appraisal pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
DGCL, shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to
_Section 2.3(a)_, without interest thereon. The Company shall provide the
Purchaser with prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the DGCL that are received by the Company, any

and the Preliminary NWC Statement. If the NWC set forth on the Preliminary NWC
Statement (the " _Estimated NWC_ ") is less than negative $5,820,000 (the "
_Target NWC_ "), then (i) an amount up to the first $1,500,000 of such
shortfall (the " _Initial Shortfall Amount_ ") will reduce the Escrowed Merger
Consideration dollar-for-dollar and (ii) any shortfall exceeding $1,500,000
shall be deducted from the Estimated Merger Consideration on a dollar for
dollar basis. If the Estimated NWC is greater than the Target NWC, then such

dollar basis (any such reduction or increase in the Estimated Merger
Consideration, the " _Closing NWC Adjustment_ ").

as expressly provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; and

immediately available funds into the Escrow Account, and the Shares Merger
Consideration, valued at the Purchaser Stock Price (the " _Escrowed Shares_

nearest whole Escrowed Share.

Escrow Period Expiration Date_ "), an amount of Escrowed Merger Consideration

released by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Account to the Paying Agent (for
further distribution by the Paying

 



      
 

 



 

Agent to the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(iii)_). The
Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Pending Claims Amount corresponding to
each claim for Losses until the final resolution of such claim, at which

Pending Claims Amount to the Paying Agent (for further distribution by the
Paying Agent to the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(iii)_)

claim. In addition, the Purchaser will be entitled to draw up to $7,500,000 of

 **2.9** ** ****_Merger Consideration Election_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Generally_. The Merger Consideration shall consist of: (i) cash (the "
_Cash Merger Consideration_ "); and (ii) shares of Purchaser Stock valued at
the Purchaser Stock Value (the " _Stock Merger Consideration_ "), with the
aggregate value of such cash and shares of Purchaser Stock equal to the Merger
Consideration amount set forth in _Section 2.6_. Each holder of Company
Shares as of the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive, with
respect to all of such holders Company Shares, either Cash Merger
Consideration or Stock Merger Consideration, in each case pursuant to the
terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 2.9_.

 



 

(b) _Cash Election_. Each Company Share with respect to which an election to
receive Cash Merger Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively
made by the holder thereof as provided in _Section 2.9(f)_ shall be converted
into the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the
Per Share Estimated Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Stock Election_. Each Company Share with respect to which an election to
receive Stock Merger Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ " and, together with
a Cash Election, an " _Election_ ") has been effectively made by the holder
thereof as provided in _Section 2.9(f)_ and has not been invalidated pursuant
to _Section 2.9(h)_ shall be converted into the right to receive the number
of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Purchaser Stock
determined by dividing: (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration; by (ii) the
Purchaser Stock Value, _provided, however_ , that no fractional shares of
Purchaser Stock shall be issued and if, after aggregating all shares of
Purchaser Stock (including fractional shares) that would be issued hereunder
to a Company Stockholder who has made a Stock Election with respect to such
Company Stockholders Company Shares, such aggregate number of shares of
Purchaser Stock includes a fraction of a share of Purchaser Stock, such
Company Stockholder shall instead receive, with respect to its Company Shares:
(A) the number of full shares of Purchaser Stock determined by rounding down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Purchaser Stock, and (B) a cash
payment equal to the product of (1) such fraction of a share of Purchaser
Stock, and (2) the Purchaser Stock Value (a " _Cash Payment in Lieu of
Fractional Shares_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Effect of Non-Election_. Each Company Share with respect to which the
Company Stockholder has not made an effective Cash Election or Stock Election
as provided in _Sections 2.9(b)_ and _(c)_ , respectively, shall be deemed to
have made a Cash Election with respect to such Company Stockholders Company
Shares.

 



 

(e) _Purchaser Stock Value_. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Purchaser
Stock Value_ " shall be equal to the numerical average of the closing prices
on NASDAQ for one (1) share of Purchaser Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the last trading day prior to the Closing
Date; _provided, however_ , that if, during such twenty **** (20) trading day
period, the Purchaser pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller
number of shares, or issues by reclassification any additional shares of
Purchaser Stock (a " _Stock Event_ "), then the Purchaser Stock Value shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as
so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Purchaser
Stock Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Purchaser
Stock Value be less than $7.20 or more than $10.80 (e.g., if the calculation
of the Purchaser Stock Value in the first sentence of this paragraph would
produce a value of $6.80, then the Purchaser Stock Value will equal $7.20 and
if such calculation of the Purchaser Stock Value would produce a value of
$12.00, then the Purchase Stock Value will equal $10.80). The floor of $7.20
and the ceiling of $10.80 will be adjusted as necessary to reflect any Stock
Event that occurs after the date hereof and prior to the Closing. The
Purchaser and the Company shall, prior to the Closing, jointly provide written
notice to the Paying Agent stating the Purchaser Stock Value.

 



 

(f) _Form of Election_. The Transmittal Letter provided by the Paying Agent
to Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.10_ shall be accompanied by a
form of election directing each Company Stockholder to, prior to the Election
Deadline (as defined below), specify: (i) whether such Company Stockholder is
making a Cash Election or a Stock Election with respect to such Company
Stockholders Company Shares (the " _Form of Election_"). For purposes of
this Agreement, the " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m., eastern time, on
the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the date of the mailing
of the Transmittal Letter. Any Election shall have been effectively made only
if the Paying Agent shall have received at its designated office, prior to the
Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed by the
applicable Company Stockholder and accompanied by the completed Transmittal
Letter and the Certificates representing the Company Shares as to which such
Form of Election relates (or a Lost Certificate Affidavit with respect to such
Company Shares, as provided in _Section 2.10(c)_).

 



 

(g) _Invalid Stock Election_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, a Stock Election shall be valid only if made by a Company
Stockholder that provides all documentation reasonably requested by the
Company to allow the Company to issue the Purchaser Stock in a manner that
satisfies the requirements of Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities
Act, including certifications to the Company: (i) that such Company
Stockholder is and will be, as of the Effective Time, an "accredited investor"
(as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities
Act); (ii) as to the basis on which such Company Stockholder is an accredited
investor; and (iii) that the Purchaser Stock is being acquired for such
Company Stockholders account for investment only and not with a view towards,
or with any intention of, a distribution or resale thereof. In addition, a
Stock Election of any Company Stockholder who will receive Shares Estimated
Merger Consideration constituting more than 1,500,000 **** shares of Purchaser
Stock (adjusted as necessary for any Stock Event) shall be valid only if such
Company Stockholder agrees in writing with the Purchaser that such Company
Stockholders Purchaser Stock will be subject to customary "lock-up"
provisions until the first anniversary of the Effective Time. If a Company
Stockholders Stock Election is invalid under this _Section 2.9(g)_, such
Company Stockholder shall be deemed to have made a Cash Election with respect
to such Company Stockholders Company Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Determination and Interpretation of Elections_. The good faith
determination of the Paying Agent (or the joint determination of the Purchaser
and the Company, if the Paying Agent declines to make any such determination)
shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not a Cash Election or Stock
Election shall have been effectively made, revoked or invalidated pursuant to
this _Section 2.9_ and as to when any Cash Election or Stock Election is
received by the Paying Agent, absent manifest error. The Paying Agent may,
with the written agreement of Parent after Parents reasonable consultation
with the Company, make any rules that are consistent with this _Section
2.9(h)_ for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections
provided for in this Agreement and shall be necessary or desirable to effect
the Cash Elections and the Stock Elections.

Corporation: (i) any Cash Merger Consideration (including any interest or
earnings thereon) and Shares Merger Consideration that has not theretofore
been distributed by the Paying Agent to Company Stockholders as provided in
_Section 2.10(b)(i)_ and is still held by the Paying Agent on the one (1)
year anniversary of the Closing Date; and (ii) any Merger Consideration
(including any interest or earnings thereon) that has not theretofore been
distributed by the Paying Agent to Company Stockholders as provided in
_Sections 2.10(b)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , or _(iv)_ and is still held by the Paying
Agent on the one (1) year anniversary of the date on which the Paying Agent
received the applicable Merger Consideration from the Purchaser. After any
such payment by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation, all Company
Stockholders shall look solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) as general creditors thereof
with respect to the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable
with respect to their Company Shares upon satisfaction of the Merger
Consideration Payment Conditions. None of the Paying Agent, the Purchaser or

 **2.11** ** ****_Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement_. Within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the
Stockholder Representative a statement (the " _Post-Closing NWC Statement_ ")
setting forth its calculation of the NWC as of the Closing, which shall be
prepared in accordance with: (i) GAAP; and (ii) the Example NWC Calculation,
and include reasonable support for the calculations made therein. If the
Stockholder Representative disagrees with the Post-Closing NWC Statement, the
Stockholder Representative may, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of
the Post-Closing NWC Statement, provide written notice thereof to the
Purchaser (the " _NWC Dispute Notice_ "), which shall provide reasonable
detail concerning each item that the Stockholder

 



      
 

 



 

Representative disputes in the Post-Closing NWC Statement and include
reasonable support for each such position. During such thirty (30) day period
and any subsequent time period in which the Post-Closing NWC Statement is
being disputed as provided in this _Section 2.11(a)_, the Purchaser shall
provide the Stockholder Representative and its representatives with reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative, to the books, records and working papers of the
Purchaser, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to the
calculations underlying the Post-Closing NWC Statement, the personnel of the
Purchaser, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and, if applicable, the
outside accountants of the Purchaser, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case who were involved in the preparation of the Post-
Closing NWC Statement. Unless the Stockholder Representative delivers an NWC
Dispute Notice within the thirty (30) day period following delivery of the
Post-Closing NWC Statement, the Post-Closing NWC Statement shall be
conclusively deemed the " _Final Post-Closing NWC Statement_ ", and shall be
final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Company Stockholders for all
purposes. For a period of fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by the
Purchaser of the NWC Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative shall use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
the disputed items set forth on the NWC Dispute Notice between themselves and,
if they are able to resolve all of such disputed items during such time
period, the Post-Closing NWC Statement shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect such resolution, and as so revised shall be conclusively
deemed the " _Final Post-Closing NWC Statement_ ", and shall be final and
binding upon the Purchaser and the Company Stockholders for all purposes. If
the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve all of
the disputed items set forth on the NWC Dispute Notice within such fifteen
(15) Business Day period, they shall jointly engage Grant Thornton LLP (the "
_Independent Accountants_ ") and submit the disputed items to the Independent
Accountants for resolution. The Independent Accountants shall act as experts
and not arbiters and shall determine only those items on the Post-Closing NWC
Statement being disputed by the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative
as of the time of engagement of the Independent Accountants. The Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Independent Accountants not
to assign a dollar amount to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
dollar amount for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the
Stockholder Representative, on the other hand (as applicable), or less than
the dollar amount for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or
the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand (as applicable). Promptly,
but no later than thirty (30) days after engagement of the Independent
Accountants, the Independent Accountants shall deliver a written report to the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative as to their resolution of the
disputed items, which shall include the resulting Post-Closing NWC Statement
incorporating such resolution. The Post-Closing NWC Statement, as determined
by the Independent Accountants, shall be conclusively deemed the " _Final
Post-Closing NWC Statement_ " and shall be final and binding upon the
Purchaser and the Company Stockholders for all purposes. The NWC as of the
Closing set forth on the Final Post-Closing NWC Statement is referred to
herein as the " _Final NWC_." The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants incurred in connection with the resolution of disputes pursuant to
this _Section 2.11(a)_ shall be borne by the Purchaser or the Company
Stockholders in proportion to the amounts of the disputed items on the NWC
Dispute Notice, as compared to such items as determined by the Independent
Accountants and set forth on the Final Post-Closing NWC Statement, with such
fees and expenses to be paid by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company
Stockholders, on the other hand, (as applicable) to the Independent
Accountants within five (5) Business Days after the Independent Accountants
determination of the Final NWC. Any fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants to be paid by the Company Stockholders pursuant to the preceding
sentence of this _Section 2.11(a)_ shall be satisfied by release to the
Independent Accountants from the Escrow Account.

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing NWC Adjustment_. In addition to the Closing NWC Adjustment
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_: (i) the Merger Consideration under this
Agreement shall be: (A) reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, by the amount
(if any) by which the Final NWC is less than the Estimated NWC (any such
shortfall, a " _Downward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment_ "); or (ii) increased,
on a dollar for

 



      
 

 



 

dollar basis, by the amount (if any) by which the Final NWC is greater than
the Estimated NWC (any such excess, an " _Upward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment_
" and, together with the Downward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment, the " _Post-
Closing NWC Adjustment_ "). Any Downward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment shall be
satisfied, within five (5) Business Days after determination of the Final NWC,
by release to the Purchaser of Escrowed Merger Consideration from the Escrow
Account, consisting of: (A) payment of Escrowed Funds by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Purchasers account, and (B) transfer of
Escrowed Shares (valued at the Purchaser Stock Price), by delivery to the
Purchaser of a stock certificate evidencing such Escrowed Shares, accompanied
by a stock power executed in blank (such release shall be effected ratably
among Escrowed Funds and Escrowed Shares in accordance with the respective
percentages thereof in the Escrow Account). Any Upward Post-Closing NWC
Adjustment shall be satisfied, within five (5) Business Days after
determination of the Final NWC, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds by the Purchaser to the Paying Agents account of an amount equal to the
Upward Post-Closing NWC Adjustment (for further distribution by the Paying
Agent to the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(ii)_). If any
payment required under this _Section 2.11(b)_ is not made in full within five
(5) Business Days after determination of the Final NWC, such payment will
thereafter bear simple interest at a rate equal to the prime rate in effect
from time to time (as published in The Wall Street Journal) plus two (2)
percentage points, until paid in full.

 



 

(c) _CABS Receivables_. For the purposes of the Example NWC Statement, the
Preliminary NWC Statement and the Final Post-Closing NWC Statement, the CABS
Receivables will be capped at $10,000,000. If the amount of the CABS
Receivables reflected on the Final Post-Closing NWC Statement would otherwise
have exceeded $10,000,000 but for the limitation in the foregoing sentence,
the amount of such excess over $10,000,000 is referred to herein as the
"Excess Receivables Amount." If the Company collects more than $10,000,000 on
the CABS Receivables that existed on the Closing Date during the nine-month
period immediately following the Closing Date, then promptly following the end
of such nine-month period, the Company will pay to the Paying Agent, for
distribution to the Company Stockholders, the amount of such collections over
$10,000,000 up to (but not exceeding) the Excess Receivables Amount.

 



 

 **2.12** ** ****_FiberNet Sale Proceeds and Fibertech Sale Proceeds_** **.**
The parties agree and acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any FiberNet Sale Proceeds or Fibertech Sale Proceeds shall be for
the account of the Company Stockholders (not the Purchaser, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries) and, accordingly: (a) the Stockholder Representative
shall have the sole and exclusive right after the Closing to interact with the
respective counterparties to the FiberNet Sale Documents and the Fibertech
Sale Documents and to negotiate payment of any FiberNet Sale Proceeds or
Fibertech Sale Proceeds thereunder, on behalf of Conversent and CTC,
respectively; provided that no amendment may be made to any of the FiberNet
Sale Documents or Fibertech Sale Documents nor may any settlement of any
indemnification or other claim under such Documents be entered into without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the event that the Purchaser, the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including Conversent and CTC)
receives any FiberNet Sale Proceeds or Fibertech Sale Proceeds after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall have the right (in lieu of making a claim against
the Estimated Merger Consideration) to set-off against and retain such
Proceeds to the extent of any indemnification obligations under _Sections
8.2(a)(iv)_ and _8.2(a)(v)_. The Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company
or such Company Subsidiary to): (i) hold any portion of such FiberNet Sale
Proceeds or Fibertech Sale Proceeds remaining after such set-off in trust for
the benefit of the Company Stockholders; and (ii) promptly pay such remaining
FiberNet Sale Proceeds or Fibertech Sale Proceeds (as applicable) over to the
Paying Agent (for further distribution by the Paying Agent to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(iv)_).

information provided to it in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the Mutual

are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the
Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 



 

 **5.5 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations_.**

 



 

(a) _Generally_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser and the Company
shall (and the Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to), in good faith
and in a reasonably timely manner, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) take or cause to be taken all appropriate action,
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable, and execute
and deliver such documents, as may be required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and consummate and make effective the Transactions; and (ii)
cause the Closing conditions contained in _Article VI_ applicable to such
Person to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Purchaser shall, and the Company shall (and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to), in good faith and in a reasonably timely manner, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Required Consents to
be obtained on or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser and the Company
shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices
to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents under any Material
Contracts **** necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
the Purchaser shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any
actions, notices, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be given or
obtained, or should be given or obtained, from parties to any Material
Contract in connection with consummation of the Merger and in seeking any such
actions, notices, consents, approvals or waivers.

Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to): (i) make or cause
to be made all filings required of

 



      
 

 



 

each of them or any of their respective Affiliates under the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any event, as
promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement; (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act for additional
information, documents or other materials received by each of them from the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or any other
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or the Transactions; (iii) seek
early termination with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act; and (iv)
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in connection
with any such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Entity with respect to any such filing. The Purchaser and the Company shall
each pay fifty percent (50%) of the filing fees required to be paid under the
HSR Act in connection with such filings (it being agreed and acknowledged that
any such payment by the Company shall either, as determined by the Company in
its sole discretion, be paid out of Company funds prior to the Closing or
accrued as a Current Liability reflected in the calculation of the NWC as of
the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.11_). The Purchaser shall, and the Company
shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to), to the extent permissible
under applicable law: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to the HSR Act in connection with the Transactions and otherwise
coordinate their efforts in connection with any such filing; (ii) promptly
inform the other party of any material written or oral communication with any
Governmental Entity regarding any such filing or additional request (which
shall include copies of any such written communications); and (iii) otherwise
reasonably consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party or its
representatives relating to proceedings under the HSR Act.

 



 

(c) _FCC and State PUCs_.

 



 

(i) The Purchaser and the Company shall promptly commence preparing the
necessary applications, notifications and related filings for obtaining the
FCC Approval and State PUC Approvals, and such applications, notifications,
and related filings shall be filed with the applicable authorities as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter but in no event later than fifteen (15)
business days after the date of this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Company
shall provide each other with all information necessary for the preparation of
such applications, notifications and filings on a reasonably timely basis,
including those portions of such applications, notifications and filings which
are required to be completed by the other party.

 



 

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser and
the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
prosecute the applications for the FCC Approval and the State PUC Approvals in
good faith and with due diligence before the FCC and the State PUCs and, in
connection therewith, take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably
required in connection with such applications, including furnishing to the FCC
and the State PUCs any documents, materials, or other information requested by
the FCC and the State PUCs in order to obtain the FCC Approval and the State
PUC Approvals as expeditiously as reasonably practicable. In addition, to the
extent reasonably practicable, the Purchaser and the Company shall each use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to: (A) promptly notify each
other of any material communication received from the FCC, any State PUC or
any other Person with respect to the FCC Approval or any of the State PUC
Approvals, as applicable; (B) permit a representative of the other party
reasonably acceptable to the first party to attend and participate in
substantive meetings (telephonic or otherwise) with the FCC or any State PUC;
and (C) permit the other party to review in advance, as reasonable, any
proposed written communication to the FCC or any State PUC. Neither the
Company nor the Purchaser shall, without the written consent of the other
party (such consent to

 



      
 

 



 

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), knowingly take, or fail
to take, any action if the intent of such action or failure to act is to cause
or materially increase the probability of the FCC or any State PUC not to
grant the FCC Approval or any State PUC Approval or materially delay or impose
material conditions on any such approval. If there are any petitions for
reconsideration, appeals or similar filings made seeking to overturn the grant
of the FCC Approval or any State PUC Approval, or if the FCC or a State PUC
seeks to reconsider such grant on its own motion, then the Purchaser and the
Company shall each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
defend the applicable grants against such actions. The Purchaser and the
Company shall each be responsible for payment of its own attorneys fees and
related costs and expenses associated with obtaining the FCC Approval and the
State PUC Approvals (it being agreed and acknowledged that any such fees,
costs and expenses of the Company that are not included in the Company
Transaction Expenses paid at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ shall
either, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, be paid out of
Company funds prior to the Closing or accrued as a Current Liability reflected
in the calculation of the NWC as of the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.11_).

 



 

 **5.6 _Disclosures Concerning Agreement and the Transactions_.** As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser and the
Company shall mutually agree upon a joint initial press release concerning
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Transactions, which
shall be disseminated at such time and in such manner as is agreed upon in
writing by the Purchaser and the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). After such initial press release is disseminated, the
Company and Purchaser will consult with each other and will mutually agree
upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to the Transactions
and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public
announcements prior to such consultation and agreement (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any agreement with any national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such
press releases or making any such public announcements; _provided_ , that each
of Purchaser and the Company may make any public statement in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as such
statements are substantially similar to previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Purchaser and the Company (or
individually, if approved by the other party).

 



 

 **5.7 _Exclusivity_. **During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, partners, members, managers, trustees, employees, agents and
advisors (collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, deal
exclusively with the Purchaser and its designated representatives regarding
any and all acquisitions of, or investments in, the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Business, whether by way of merger, consolidation
or other business combination with any other Person, purchase or exchange of
capital stock or other equity interests, purchase of assets or otherwise (an "
_Alternative Transaction_ ") and, without the prior consent of the Purchaser,
the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives not to: (a) solicit, initiate or otherwise engage in
any negotiations, discussions or other communications with any other Person
relating to any Alternative Transaction; (b) provide information or
documentation to any other Person with respect to the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets in respect of any
Alternative Transaction; or (c) enter into any Contract, letter of intent,
memorandum of terms or understanding with any other Person in respect of any
Alternative Transaction. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, cease immediately all
discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this
Agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction. The Company shall promptly
after

 



      
 

 



 

the date of this Agreement instruct each Person which has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement relating to an Alternative Transaction with or for
the benefit of the Company to promptly return or destroy all information,
documents, and materials relating to the Alternative Transaction or to the
Company or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the
Company or any of the Company Representatives to such Person or any of the
Company Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person.

 



 

 **5.8 _Notification_. **During the Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser and the
Company shall each give written notice to the other promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) after acquiring actual knowledge of the
occurrence of any omission, event or action that: (a) has caused, or is
reasonably likely to cause the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; (b) is reasonably likely to
cause any of its respective representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement not to be true and correct in all material respects as of the
Closing (disregarding for this purpose any materiality, Company Material
Adverse Effect or Purchaser Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein)
and is not reasonably likely to be capable of cure prior to the Closing; (c)
has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause any condition to the other
partys obligation to consummate the Closing not to be satisfied; or (d) would
otherwise be reasonably expected to delay materially or prevent the
consummation of the Closing.

 



 

 **5.9 _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.**

 



 

(a) Except as required by applicable Law, the Purchaser agrees to honor and
fulfill in all material respects the Companys obligations to provide
indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring
on or prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, limited liability company managers, officers or employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as provided in their respective
Organizational Documents or in indemnification agreements (correct and
complete copies of which were made available by the Company to the Purchaser
in the Virtual Data Room prior to the date of this Agreement), in each case in
effect as of the Closing, (i) in accordance with their respective terms, with
respect to any indemnification agreements, or (ii) for a period of not less
than six (6) years after the Closing Date, with respect to the Organizational
Documents.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company Stockholders, on the other
hand, shall each be responsible for paying for one-half (1/2) of the cost of a
non-cancelable run-off insurance policy, for a period of six (6) years after
the Closing Date to provide insurance coverage for events, acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date for all persons who were directors,
limited liability company managers or officers of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date, which the Company shall
procure and put into effect on or prior to the Closing Date (it being agreed
and acknowledged that the Company Stockholders portion of such cost shall
either, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, be paid out of
Company funds prior to the Closing or accrued as a Current Liability reflected
in the calculation of the NWC as of the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.11_).

 



 

 **5.10 _Employee Benefits_.**

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and each
Company Subsidiary to honor all rights to paid time off, including vacation,
personal and sick days, accrued by employees of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan. Until December 31, 2011, the
Purchaser shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to provide to
all individuals (i) currently employed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as of the date hereof or (ii) hired by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary between the date hereof and the Closing, but excluding individuals
who cease to be employed by the Company or any Company

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary prior to the Closing, in each case, who continue to be employed
after the Closing (" _Business Employees_ "), compensation and benefits (other
than equity-based compensation agreements), that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than the compensation and benefits provided to the Business
Employees as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement
in which any Business Employee first becomes eligible to participate, on or
after the Closing, and in which such Business Employee did not participate
prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company and
each Company Subsidiary to): (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, evidence
of insurability or good health or actively-at-work exclusions applicable to
such Business Employee under any such new plans in which such Business
Employee may be eligible to participate after the Closing, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health
or actively-at-work exclusions would apply under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan; (ii) provide each such Business Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid by such Business Employee prior to the Closing (to the
same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Closing) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any such new plan in which such Business Employee may be
eligible to participate after the Closing; and (iii) recognize all service of
such Business Employee with the Company for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting in any such new plan in which such Business Employee
may be eligible to participate after the Closing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.10_, in no
event shall any provision of this Agreement, express or implied, be
interpreted to: (i) prohibit any changes by Purchaser to any employee benefit
plan, policy, program or arrangement; or (ii) require the Purchaser to cause
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to continue any particular Company
Benefit Plan or prevent or restrict the amendment or termination thereof. This
_Section 5.10_ is not intended to, and shall not be interpreted to, create
any right of employment, continued employment for any period, terms of
employment or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, of any
nature whatsoever, for any employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any representative of any such employee, and constitutes an
agreement solely between the Purchaser and the Company, which shall not be
enforceable by any such employee or representative, or constitute an agreement
under which any such employee or representative otherwise has any rights or
remedies.

 



 

(d) Prior to December 31, 2010, the Company shall take all actions, including
amendments, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan which is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code) to which the Company is a party to, so that it is in documentary
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and any proposed and final guidance
under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(e) No payments or benefits payable in connection with the Closing shall
constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Code Section 280G or, if
parachute payments are otherwise payable, Company shall take the necessary
actions to ensure that such payments qualify for an exemption under Section
280G and specifically Treasury Regulation section 1.280G-1 QandA 5 ("
_Exemptions_ "), and if the stockholder approval exemption is used, the
Company shall provide the Purchaser with draft disclosure and waiver documents
for its review and comment prior to delivery to Companys stockholders. Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall provide Buyer with notice that no parachute
payments are payable or, if applicable, evidence that one of the Exemptions is
satisfied.

 



 

 **5.11 _Maintenance of Books and Records_.** For a period of at least seven
(7) years after the Closing Date: (a) the Purchaser shall cause the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to maintain their respective books and records in
existence as of the Closing Date; and (b) upon reasonable written notice, the
Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide to
any Company

 



       
 

 



 

Stockholder and its representatives, employees, counsel and accountants
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, such
books and records relating to periods prior to the Closing Date, and shall
permit such Persons to examine and copy, at the sole cost and expense of the
party providing access, such books and records to the extent reasonably
requested by any such Persons as is reasonably necessary for financial
reporting, accounting and Tax matters, the preparation and filing of any
returns, reports or forms or the defense of any claim or assessment;
_provided, however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to cause the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to furnish such books and records pursuant
to this _Section 5.11_ to the extent such books and records contain attorney-
client work product or the disclosure of such documents or materials would
violate any attorney-client privilege, confidentiality agreement or Law. The
parties agree to cooperate so that such access does not unreasonably disrupt
the normal operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

 **5.12 _Stockholder Approval_.** The Company shall, promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, obtain the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, the Merger, and the other Transactions by the required vote of the
Companys stockholders under the DGCL and the Companys Organizational
Documents pursuant to the Company Stockholder Consent and on the Business Day
following such consent provide written notice of such action to each of the
Company Stockholders that does not execute the Company Stockholder Consent in
accordance with the DGCL and the Stockholder Agreement.

 



 

 **5.13 _Tax Matters_.**

 



 

(a) _Indemnification for Taxes_. Except to the extent reflected in the Final
NWC, the Company Stockholders shall be liable for and indemnify and hold
harmless (severally and not jointly, as provided in _Section 8.2(a)_) the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, without duplication, for: (i) any Taxes imposed
on or with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Taxable Period, (ii) any Taxes arising out of a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section 3.8_, and (iii) any Taxes of
any Person for any Pre-Closing Taxable Period imposed on the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (A) pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, or (B)
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise (collectively, together
with any other amounts for which the Company Stockholders are liable under
this _Section 5.13_, including _Section 5.13(e)_, the " _Indemnified Taxes_
").

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed: (i) all Tax Returns of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date that have not yet been filed and are required to be filed after the
Closing Date, and (ii) all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date. Such
Tax Returns, to the extent relating to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period
(including any Straddle Period), shall be prepared consistently with past
practice to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Purchaser shall
permit the Stockholder Representative to review and comment on each such Tax
Return not less than ten (10) days prior to filing. The Stockholder
Representative shall notify the Purchaser of any reasonable objections that it
has with respect to any items set forth in such Tax Return, and the
Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser agree to consult and attempt to
resolve in good faith any such objection. To the extent that the Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative are unable to reach an agreement regarding the
revisions to be made to such Tax Returns, the dispute shall be submitted to
the Independent Accountants for resolution, with the costs of the Independent
Accountants borne equally by the Purchaser and the Company Stockholders. The
Company Stockholders shall be liable for any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns solely to the extent provided in _Section 5.13(a)_ (i.e., to the
extent not reflected in the Final NWC).

 



 

(c) _Tax Contests_. Whenever any Tax Authority asserts a claim, makes an
assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Company
Stockholders are or may

 



      
 

 



 

be liable under this _Section 5.13_, the Purchaser shall, if informed of such
an assertion, promptly inform the Stockholder Representative, and the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to control any resulting
proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim,
assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect
the amount of Taxes for which the Company Stockholders may be liable under
this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that if such settlement would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the liability of the Purchaser, the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries for Taxes for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, such settlement shall not be agreed
to without the consent of the Purchaser, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, _provided, further_ , that, since the
Company Stockholders potential liability under this _Section 5.13_ is
limited to the Escrow Account under _Sections 8.3(b)_ and _(c)_ , the
Stockholder Representative shall not have any such rights following the final
distribution and termination of the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, whenever any Tax Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or
otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the
Purchaser shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings and to
determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute,
except to the extent such proceedings would reasonably be expected to affect
the amount of Taxes for which the Company Stockholders are liable under this
_Section 5.13_, in which case such settlement shall not be agreed to by the
Purchaser without the consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event of any conflict between this _Section 5.13(c)_ and _Section 8.5_,
the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.13(c)_ shall control.

 



 

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax allocation or sharing agreement to which
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party shall be terminated
on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party shall have any
rights or obligations under any such Tax allocation or sharing agreement.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne one-half
(1/2) by the Purchaser and one-half (1/2) by the Company Stockholders when

connection with the arrangement of, and the negotiation of agreements with
respect to, any such financing.

 



 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall use commercially

connection with: (i) the completion of any private offering memorandums or
other disclosure documents, (ii) the Purchasers efforts to cause the
Companys financial statements to be audited and to comply with Regulation
S-X, and (iii) the Purchasers preparation of _pro forma_ financial
information for purposes of its reports, or other filings (including any
registration statement, any amendment thereto, or any prospectus or prospectus
supplement in connection therewith) in accordance with Securities Act or the
Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that the Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that completion of such audit, compliance with Regulation S-X or preparation
of such _pro forma_ financial information shall not be a condition to its
obligation to consummate the Closing

 



 

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, in the event the SEC has comments or
questions on any of the Companys financial information, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reasonably assist and cooperate, and shall
cause its independent accountants to assist and cooperate, with the Purchaser,
the Purchasers independent accountants and the SEC to resolve any such issues
and questions regarding the Company Information and take such commercially
reasonably actions with respect to such financial statements or information as
are necessary for the Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under Regulation
S-X.

 



 

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with the Purchasers reasonable
requests in connection with the Purchasers compliance with applicable Laws
with respect to the transactions hereunder, including: (i) providing access to
its management upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours to
assist with SEC reporting obligations of the transactions hereunder, including
the preparation by the Purchaser of _pro forma_ financial statements and
addressing purchase accounting issues; and (ii) allowing access to the

reporting requirements, including financial statements and the notes thereto.

 



 

(e) The parties agree and acknowledge that all actions taken by the Company
shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Purchaser and the Purchaser
shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all costs reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with the actions
taken by the Company pursuant to the terms of this _Section 5.14_.

 



 

 **5.15 _Purchaser SEC Filings_.** The Company shall, during the one (1) year
period following the Effective Time, make and keep available adequate current
public information, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act.

(b) by either the Company or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before September 30, 2011 (or such other date to which the
Company or the Purchaser may agree upon in writing) (the " _End Date_ ")
because one or more conditions to respective obligations of the Company or the

or _6.2_ , as applicable, has not been satisfied; _provided, however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not
be available to either party if the failure by such party to fulfill any of
its obligations under this Agreement caused, or resulted in, the failure of
the Closing Date to occur on or before such date;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) by either the Company or the Purchaser if any Order preventing the
consummation of the Closing shall have been entered by any court of competent
jurisdiction and shall have become a Final Order; _provided, however_ , that
neither party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_
unless such party has used commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
entry of and to procure the removal, reversal, dissolution, setting aside or
invalidation of such Order;

 



 

(d) by the Purchaser, either: (i) after the occurrence of a non-curable breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement that shall have rendered impossible the satisfaction
of the conditions to Closing in _Sections 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ ; or (ii)
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of notice from the Purchaser of
the occurrence of a curable material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement if the same
has not been cured in its entirety within such time period (or if the End Date
is less than thirty (30) days from such notice, if not cured by the End Date),
in either case such that the conditions to the obligation of the Purchaser and
Merger Sub to consummate the Closing set forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ and _(b)_
, respectively, would not be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that the
Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(d)_ if the Purchaser is then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

(e) by the Company, either: (i) after the occurrence of a non-curable breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser or

to consummate the Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ , respectively,

_Sections 7.1(c)_ , _(d)_ or _(e)_ ); _provided, however,_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(f)_ shall not be available
to either party if any failure by such party to fulfill any of its obligations
under this Agreement caused such Closing condition to have become incapable of
satisfaction; or

 



 

(g) by the Purchaser, if the Company shall not have obtained the Company
Stockholder Consent and provided the Purchaser with written evidence thereof
in the form of a certificate executed by the Secretary of the Company within
twelve (12) hours after the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

Any termination made in accordance with _Section 7.1(b)_, _(c)_ , _(d)_ ,

Merger Sub and the Company contained in this Agreement, and the respective
rights of the Purchaser and the Company Stockholders to indemnification

statute of limitations applicable to the matters underlying such
representation and warranty. The respective rights of the Purchaser and the
Company Stockholders to indemnification hereunder with respect to breach of
any of the covenants or agreements of the other party set forth in this
Agreement shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of

(b) If an Indemnity Claim Notice has been provided by an Indemnified Party to
an Indemnifying Party concerning the breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement prior to the end of the
survival period that would otherwise apply to such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, the end of the survival period of such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement solely with respect to the claim underlying
such Indemnity Claim Notice shall be extended until such later date as such
claim has been fully and finally resolved in accordance with this _Article
VIII_.

 



 

 **8.2 _Indemnification Obligations_.**

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_, from and after
the Closing, each Company Stockholder shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and each of its Affiliates (which,
following the Closing, shall include the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
partners, members, managers, agents and representatives (each, a " _Purchaser
Indemnified Party_ ") for its respective Pro Rata Share of any Losses
resulting from or arising out of any:

 



 

(i) breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Company set

(ii) breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this
Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Indemnified Taxes;

(b) From and after the Closing, each Company Stockholder shall, severally and
not jointly, indemnify each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any
Losses actually incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of
any breach of any of the representations and warranties of such Company
Stockholder set forth in such Company Stockholders Transmittal Letter.
Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 8.2(b)_ shall not be subject to any of the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.3_.

 



 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_, from and after
the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify each of the Company Stockholders
and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners,
members, managers, agents and representatives (each, a " _Company Stockholder
Indemnified Party_ ") for any Losses actually incurred by such Company
Stockholder Indemnified Party as a result of any:

 



 

(i) breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) breach of any of the covenants or agreements of the Purchaser or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.3 _Limitations on Indemnification Amounts_. **Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Article VIII:

 



 

(a) in no event shall the Company Stockholders be required to provide
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than indemnification
for breaches of the Company Fundamental Representations, to which the
Indemnity Threshold Amount shall not apply) unless and until the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall have incurred aggregate Losses of at least
$3,700,000 **** (the " _Indemnity Threshold Amount_ "), after which point the
Company Stockholders shall be required to provide indemnification with respect
to all indemnifiable Losses, including the Indemnity Threshold Amount;

 



 

(b) in no event shall the Company Stockholders collectively be required to
provide indemnification under this _Article VIII_ for aggregate indemnifiable

Merger Consideration (the " _Overall Company Stockholder Indemnity Cap_ ");
and

 



       
 

 



 

(c) in no event shall any Company Stockholder be required to provide
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ for any amount exceeding such
Company Stockholders Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Merger Consideration (the
" _Individual Company Stockholder Indemnity Cap_ ").

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, the
parties agree and acknowledge that the contents of the Escrow Account shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy and source of satisfaction of any amount(s)
determined pursuant to this _Article VIII_ to be due to any Purchaser
Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_.

 



 

 **8.4** ** ****_Indemnification Claim Procedure_** **.**

 



 

(a) Promptly after becoming aware of the existence of any potential matter
that a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Company Stockholder Indemnified Party,
as applicable (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), acting in good faith, reasonably
believes will entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnification from the
Company Stockholders or the Purchaser, respectively (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "), under this _Article VIII_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
provide to Indemnifying Party notice describing the the matter in reasonable
detail, including the nature of the claim, the basis for the indemnification
obligation and the Losses resulting therefrom (an " _Indemnity Claim Notice_
"); _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed
to be the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties (whether they are the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party) for purposes of sending and
receiving Indemnity Claim Notices and Indemnity Claim Responses and otherwise
taking actions pursuant to this _Section 8.4_ and _Section 8.5_. To the
extent that any such matter relates to a Claim or Proceeding by any Person
other than: (i) a party to this Agreement; (ii) a Purchaser Indemnified Party;
or (iii) a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party_ "), such
Claim or Proceeding is referred to herein as a " _Third Party Claim_ ", which
is governed by _Section 8.5_. No delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in giving the Indemnifying Party an Indemnity Claim Notice shall limit or
reduce the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder, nor relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII,
unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) For claims for indemnification under this _Article VIII_ other than those
relating to Third Party Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20)
Business Days after its receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice to respond to
the claim(s) described therein (an " _Indemnity Claim Response_ "), which
shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Indemnifying Partys objection(s)
to the claim(s) and its bases for such objection(s). If the Indemnifying Party
fails to provide an Indemnity Claim Response with such time period, the
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have conceded the claim(s) set forth in
the Indemnity Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party provides an Indemnity
Claim Response within such time period, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall negotiate the resolution of the claim(s) for a period
of not fewer than twenty (20) Business Days after the Indemnity Claim Response
is provided. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to
resolve any such claim(s) within such time period, the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to pursue any legal remedies available to the Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party with respect solely to the unresolved claim(s),
subject to Indemnity Threshold Amount, the Overall Company Stockholder
Indemnity Cap, the Individual Company Stockholder Indemnity Cap and the other
provisions of this _Article VIII_, as applicable.

 



 

 **8.5** ** ****_Third Party Claims_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and pursue the
defense of any Third Party Claim involving solely monetary damages (and does
not, and would not reasonably be expected to, result in criminal liability of,
or equitable remedies against, the Indemnified Party), at its sole

 



      
 

 



 

cost and expense and with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, upon notification thereof to the Indemnified Party within ten (10)
Business Days after the Indemnity Claim Notice has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Party; _provided, however_ , that if the Indemnifying Partys
assumption of the defense of any Third Party Claim would (as described in a
written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party)
result in a conflict of interest arising out of the joint representation by
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party of the interests of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to engage separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party to represent the Indemnified Party (at the Indemnifying Partys sole
cost and expense) and, if the Indemnifying Party fails to do so during the ten
(10) Business Day period referred to above, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be entitled to assume the Indemnified Partys defense of such Third Party
Claim. It is agreed and understood that the Indemnifying Partys election to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim shall not constitute an admission
that any Losses resulting therefrom are indemnifiable Losses under this
_Article VIII_ or in any way prejudice or limit the Indemnifying Partys
ability to dispute any determination of whether or not any such Losses are
indemnifiable Losses under this _Article VIII_. If: (i) the Indemnified Party
does not receive notification from the Indemnifying Party of its assumption of
the defense of a Third Party Claim within the ten (10) Business Day time
period referred to above; (ii) the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim as described above in this _Section
8.5_; or (iii) at any time after the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party fails to perform or
unreasonably delays in performing its obligations to assume or pursue the
defense of such Thirty Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall fully assume,
commence and pursue its defense of such Third Party Claim on a timely and
prudent basis and thereafter promptly inform the Indemnifying Party of all
material developments related thereto and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel for the Indemnified Party as
incurred.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, it
shall thereafter promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material
developments related thereto. With respect to any Third Party Claim for which
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its own cost and
expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim through legal counsel
reasonably selected by it, but shall not assert or pursue, directly or through
its counsel, any contrary or inconsistent defenses without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. As long as the Indemnifying Party is
performing its obligations under this _Section 8.5_, the Indemnified Party
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party,
cooperate in all reasonable ways with, make its and their relevant files and
records reasonably available for inspection and copying by, make its and their
employees reasonably available to, and otherwise render reasonable assistance
to, the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (having assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim) or the Indemnified Party (having proceeded with its own defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 8.5_) proposes to settle
or compromise such Thirty Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party (as applicable) shall provide notice to that effect
(together with a statement in reasonable detail of the terms and conditions of
such settlement or compromise) to the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying
Party (as applicable), which shall be provided a reasonable time prior to the
proposed time for effecting such settlement or compromise, and may not effect
any such settlement or compromise without the prior consent of the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party (as applicable); _provided, however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim after having provided such notice to the Indemnified Party but
without the consent of the Indemnified Party if: (i) such settlement or
compromise does not include any admission of liability by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates; (ii) such settlement or compromise provides for the
full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
from any and all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim; (iii)

 



      
 

 



 

any monetary obligations of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates to the
applicable Third Party with respect to such settlement or compromise are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iv) such settlement or compromise does
not include any equitable remedies restricting future actions by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

 



 

 **8.6** ** ****_Payment of Amounts Due for Indemnification_** **.**

 



 

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after it is determined pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ that any amount is due to any Purchaser Indemnified Party, a
portion of the Escrowed Merger Consideration that is the lesser of: (i) such
amount; or (ii) the amount of the Escrowed Merger Consideration then remaining
in the Escrow Account, shall be released from the Escrow Account to the
Purchaser, consisting of: (A) payment of Escrowed Funds by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Purchasers account, and (B) transfer of
Escrowed Shares (valued at the Purchaser Stock Price), rounded to the nearest
number of whole Escrowed Shares, by delivery to the Purchaser of a stock
certificate evidencing such Escrowed Shares, accompanied by a stock power
executed in blank (such release shall be effected ratably among Escrowed Funds
and Escrowed Shares in accordance with the respective percentages thereof in
the Escrow Account). Each Company Stockholder shall have a right of
contribution from the applicable other Company Stockholder(s) to the extent
that: (i) any Escrowed Merger Consideration from the Escrow Account in excess

 **ARTICLE IX: 
GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **9.1** ** ****_Stockholder Representative_** **.**

 



 

(a) Pursuant to the Stockholder Representative agreement, in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit J_ (the " _Stockholder Representative Agreement_ "), the
Stockholder Representative shall be named as the agent and representative of
all of the Company Stockholders, including without limitation, for purposes of
receiving on their behalf all notices under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, the FiberNet Sale
Documents and the Fibertech Sale Documents, issuing on their behalf such
notices under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the
Paying Agent Agreement, the FiberNet Sale Documents and the Fibertech Sale
Documents, in each case as the Stockholder Representative shall determine in
its sole discretion to issue, and performing such other administrative and
other functions under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, the FiberNet Sale Documents and the
Fibertech Sale Documents, in each case as may become necessary or desirable.
The Stockholder Representative Agreement shall be binding on each of the
Company Stockholders as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_ hereof.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have full power and authority to act
for and on behalf of the Company Stockholders and their respective heirs,
successors, and assigns in regard to their rights and obligations under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement, the FiberNet Sale Documents and the Fibertech Sale Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder
Representative is authorized on behalf of the Company Stockholders to: (i)
administer the Post-Closing NWC Adjustment process under _Section 2.11_; (ii)
resolve all claims for indemnification under _Article VIII_ of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement; (iii)
administer post-Closing matters relating to payment of any FiberNet Sale
Proceeds or Fibertech Sale Proceeds; (iv) retain counsel of its choosing,
experts and other professionals as may be necessary or desirable to assist in
any such matters; and (v) give such notices to the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement or to the Paying Agent under the Paying Agent Agreement, in
each case as the Stockholder Representative, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may determine to be necessary or appropriate. The Stockholder
Representative shall have no right to act as agent for service of process for
any one of the Company Stockholders, except that any notice delivered to the
Stockholder Representative from the Purchaser or the Escrow Agent with respect
to the Escrow Agreement, or from the Paying Agent with respect to Paying Agent
Agreement, shall be deemed notice to all Company Stockholders with respect
thereto and any notice delivered to the Stockholder Representative with
respect to any claim under _Article VIII_ and any other matter under this
Agreement after the Closing shall be deemed notice to all Company Stockholders
with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser shall be named as a third party beneficiary in the
Stockholder Representative Agreement. Neither the removal of a then acting
Stockholder Representative nor such appointment of a successor Stockholder
Representative shall be effective until notice of such act has been provided
to the Purchaser and the delivery to the Purchaser and Escrow Agent of
executed counterparts of

 



      
 

 



 

a writing signed by sufficient number of Company Stockholders necessary to
authorize such removal and appointment, together with an acknowledgment signed
by the successor Stockholder Representative appointed in such writing that it,
he or she accepts the responsibility of successor Stockholder Representative
and agrees to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the Stockholder Representative, with a copy of such
acknowledgement being promptly provided to the Purchaser. Each successor
Stockholder Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights and
privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original Stockholder
Representative, and the term "Stockholder Representative" as used herein and
in the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to include any interim or successor
Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser will at all times without any further act or inquiry have
the right to rely on any act, decision, consent or instruction of, or
instrument or other writing executed by, the Stockholder Representative as the
final and binding act of all of the Company Stockholders, and by approval of
the Merger the Company Stockholders waive any claim arising out of, or right
to object to, any action so taken by the Purchaser or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates. It is understood and agreed by each of the
parties hereto that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or deemed to
expand or create any right on the part of a Company Stockholder, with respect
to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any obligation on the part of
the Purchaser, or any of its Affiliates, to any Company Stockholder not
otherwise expressly set forth in clear and unambiguous terms in this Agreement
(to the extent that there may be any such provisions herein).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.1, the
Stockholder Representative shall not have any power or authority to act for or
on behalf of any Company Stockholder or its heirs, successors or assigns, with
respect to any claim under Section 8.2(b) or any claim that a Company
Stockholder, in its capacity as such, committed fraud (each, an " _Individual
Stockholder Claim_ "). The Stockholder Representative shall have no right to
act as agent for service of process for any Company Stockholder with respect
to an Individual Stockholder Claim.

 



 

 **9.2** ** ****_Notices_** **.** All notices, consents, waivers, agreements
and other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be provided or
made in writing and shall be provided: (x) by personal delivery, (y) by

Purchasers or Merger Subs rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by such party without the prior written
consent of: (a) with respect to any such assignment or delegation occurring on
or prior to the Closing, the Company; and (b) with respect to any such
assignment or delegation occurring after the Closing, the Stockholder
Representative; _provided, however_ , that the Purchaser or Merger Sub shall
be

 



      
 

 



 

permitted to assign or delegate any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to the Purchaser or to one or more direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Purchaser, _provided_ that the Purchaser
shall remain secondarily liable hereunder in the event of any such assignment.

breach of this Agreement and that irreparable harm would result if this
Agreement were not specifically enforced. Therefore, the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be enforceable by a decree of specific
performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate
injunctive relief may be applied for in connection therewith, without the
necessity of posting a bond or other security or proving actual damages and
without regard to the adequacy of any remedy at law. A partys right to
specific performance shall be in addition to all other legal or equitable
remedies available to such party.

 



 

 **9.14** ** ****_Third Party Beneficiaries_** **. **Nothing in this Agreement

be done all things necessary, proper or advisable, and execute, deliver and
acknowledge such documents and other papers as may be required to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and to give effect to the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



 

 **9.16** ** ****_Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_** **.**

Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that Kelley

cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to waive any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Kelley Drye and Warren, LLP representing the Company
Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative after the Closing.

shall not apply with respect to the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation (i)
defending against, or exercising subrogation, contribution or similar rights
with respect to, any derivative actions initiated by Company Stockholders or
(ii) prosecuting or defending claims by or against other third parties in
which the interests of the Purchaser and/or the Surviving Corporation could
