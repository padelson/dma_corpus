fifteen (15) days of receipt by a Party of a written request for the
appointment of such an accountant by the other Party, then the American
Arbitration Association shall appoint the Settlement Accountant. Each of
Seller and Buyer agree to enter into a customary engagement letter with the

and Buyer or Seller, as the case may be. Unless otherwise directed by the
Settlement Accountant, (i) Buyer shall first make a written submission
addressing the challenged items on the Statement of Objections, (ii) Seller
shall then be given an opportunity to respond in writing to Buyer's
submission, (iii) Buyer shall thereafter be given an opportunity to reply to
Seller's response and (iv) Seller shall be given a final opportunity to submit
a rejoinder on the points raised by the Buyer. The Settlement Accountant shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to request information or ask
questions of the Parties as he or she sees fit. The Settlement Accountant's

insurability and (C) an actively-at-work requirement, in any and all Buyer
Benefit Plans to the extent that coverage under such Buyer Benefit Plans
replaces or continues coverage under comparable Seller Plans in which such
Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
(ii) for purposes of each Buyer Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Buyer Benefit Plan to be

same extent such pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements were waived under any comparable Seller Plan prior to the Closing

Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Seller Plan ending on the Closing Date to be taken into account under
such Buyer Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Transferred Employee

of notes evidencing participant loans) of the account balances of each
Transferred Employee from any Seller Plan that is a tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement plan with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") if
such direct rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law and the
terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan by such Transferred Employee.

respect to any personally identifiable information or other sensitive
information pertaining to individual persons or any trade secret or

or its Affiliates other than the Acquired Companies.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Seller, Buyer or the Equity Investors or any of their respective Affiliates

investment in Buyer or its indirect investment in the Acquired Companies, then
Buyer may, at its option, and shall upon the direction of the Seller, cause
the Equity Commitment Letter by and between Buyer and Aquiline to be
terminated pursuant to the terms thereof and following any such termination,

required by applicable Law, including the rules or regulations of any stock
exchange or self-regulatory organization, in which case such Disclosing Party

Section 6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. Seller shall give prompt notice
to Buyer and Buyer shall give prompt notice to Seller of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would
cause (a) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (b) a material failure of
Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) no
such notification shall affect the representations and warranties of either of
the Parties or the conditions to the performance by the Parties and (ii) the
failure to provide such notice shall not give rise to a separate
indemnification claim.

Section 6.13 Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer and Seller shall each economically bear, and indemnify the other
for, 50% of all Transfer Taxes, if any, arising out of or in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but for this purpose,
excluding any transfer pursuant to Section 6.5). All such Transfer Taxes, if
any, shall be timely paid, and any related Tax Returns timely filed, by the
Party required to pay for such Taxes, and file such Tax Returns, under
applicable Law. Each of Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in
preparing and filing when due all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes and shall execute and deliver all instruments
and certificates reasonably required to obtain the benefit of any available
exemptions from or reduction in any such Transfer Taxes or to enable the other
Party to comply with any filing requirements relating to any such Transfer
Taxes.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.13a):

(i) Seller shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies required to be filed by the Acquired
Companies for taxable periods ending on or before, and due after, the Closing
Date, and all such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable
Law and in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Acquired
Companies to the extent consistent with applicable Law. Seller shall provide
drafts of each such Tax Return to Buyer for Buyer's review and comment at
least thirty (30) days (or in the case of non-income Tax Returns, a reasonable
period of time prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (including any
applicable extensions)). Seller shall consider in good faith all reasonable
comments to such Tax Returns made in writing by Buyer that are provided to
Seller at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return (including any applicable extensions). Seller shall pay all Taxes shown
to be due on such Tax Returns. 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies for any Straddle Periods. Buyer shall
provide drafts of each such Tax Return to Seller for Seller's review and
comment at least thirty (30) days (or in the case of non-income Tax Returns, a
reasonable period of time prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(including any applicable extensions)). Buyer shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments to such Tax Returns made in writing by Seller that are
provided to Seller at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return (including any applicable extensions). Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amount of Seller's share of Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns,
as determined under Section 6.13, within five (5) days of the filing of such
Tax Returns.

(c) In the case of Taxes of any Acquired Company that are payable with respect
to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that are treated as Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for purposes of this Agreement shall be (1) in
the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income, receipts, profits,
wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed in connection with the sale,
transfer or assignment of property, or (iii) required to be withheld, deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended with the
Closing Date; and (2) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period. For the
avoidance of doubt, any available net operating losses, including net
operating loss carryforwards, carrybacks, or similar Tax items, attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall, to the extent available, first be allocated
to offset any Taxes with respect to that portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date.

(d) After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate with respect to the preparing
of any Tax Returns and for any audits of, or disputes with, any Governmental
Body. Such cooperation shall include the retention of all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, abiding by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder at the requesting Party's expense. Buyer and
Seller further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

(e) Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days upon the receipt of any
notice, or becoming aware, of any audit or other similar examination with
respect to Taxes of an Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Straddle Period) (a "Tax
Contest"); provided that no failure or delay of Buyer in providing such notice
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, except to the extent that Seller is materially and adversely
prejudiced as a result of such failure or delay. In the case of a Tax Contest
that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall control the conduct
of such Tax Contest; provided that Buyer shall have the right to participate
(at its sole expense) in any such Tax Contest and with counsel of its
choosing. In the case of a Tax Contest that relates to a Straddle Period,
Buyer shall control the conduct of such Tax Contest, including by selecting
counsel, and both Parties shall (i) have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate (at each Party's own expense) in any such Tax Contest, and (ii)
have the right to approve in advance all settlements or compromises with
respect to such Tax Contest. To the extent Seller controls any Tax Contest, it
shall provide Buyer with copies of all correspondence from any Taxing
Authority relating to such Tax Contest, permit Buyer to attend meetings and
review and comment on submissions relating to any such Tax Contest, and shall
consider in good faith any comments provided by Buyer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not settle or otherwise resolve
any Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). To the extent of any
conflict between this Section 6.13(e) and Section 10.3(e), the provisions of
this Section 6.13(e) shall control with respect to any Tax Contests.

(f) Without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer will not, and will not
cause or permit any of the Acquired Companies to, take any of the following
actions with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns, in each case for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period to the extent such actions would increase Seller's liability for
Indemnified Taxes or reduce Seller's entitlement to Tax refunds under Section
6.13g): (i) file, or cause to be filed, any restatement or amendment of,
modification to, or claim for refund relating to, any Tax Return of an
Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or 

change any Tax election with respect to any Acquired Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (iii) extend or waive any statute of limitations with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (iv) make any election under Section 336 or 338 of the Code with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (v) except as required by
Law, file Tax Returns for any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in
a jurisdiction in which the relevant Acquired Company has not historically
filed Tax Returns, (vi) initiate discussions or examinations with a Taxing
Authority or make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes or Tax
Returns of any Acquired Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (vii) change any
accounting method or adopt any convention for an Acquired Company that shifts
taxable income from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
shifts deductions or losses from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Post-Closing
Tax Period or (viii) take any action after the Closing outside the ordinary
course of business.

(g) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds received for federal, state, local
or foreign Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Acquired Company,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any refunds related to the carryback of
any net operating losses or similar Tax items to the extent such net operating
losses or similar Tax items were generated in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and are
permitted to be carried back pursuant to the CARES Act or similar COVID-19
Legislation, in each case along with any interest paid by the relevant Taxing
Authority with respect thereto, net of any out-of-pocket costs of the Acquired
Companies to obtain such refund. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Seller in the preparation of any claim for refund,
including amended Tax Return, with respect to any refunds for which Seller is
entitled pursuant to this Section 6.13(g), including, but not limited to any
amount of net operating losses or similar Tax items that are permitted to be
carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, that Buyer shall not be
required to file or cause to be filed any amended Tax Return to the extent
such amended Tax Return could increase the Taxes payable by Buyer or any
Affiliate thereof (including any Acquired Company) in a Post-Closing Tax
Period, excluding any increase in Taxes payable in a Post-Closing Tax Period
that results solely from the reduction of available net operating losses that
were carried over from a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such refunds that are
received by the applicable Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof after the
Closing Date, whether by offset, credit, receipt of payment or otherwise,
shall be paid to Seller (along with any interest received thereon and less any
out-of-pocket costs) within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt thereof.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, Seller shall have no right under this Agreement
to any Tax refund received by an Acquired Company with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the extent such Tax refund is the result of the
carryback to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a net operating loss or other Tax
attribute created in a Post-Closing Tax Period, whether as a result of the
CARES Act, any similar COVID-19 Legislation or otherwise.

Section 6.14 Financing.

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary to (i) maintain in effect the Equity
Commitment Letters, (ii) comply with its obligations in the Equity Commitment
Letters and (iii) in the event that all conditions contained in the Equity
Commitment Letters have been satisfied (or upon such funding will be
satisfied), to cause the Equity Investors to fund the Equity Financing on the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.14 shall require, and in no
event shall the best efforts of Buyer and its Representatives be deemed or
construed to require, Buyer or any of its Representatives or Affiliates to (x)
amend or waive any of the terms or conditions of the Equity Commitment
Letters, or (y) consummate the Equity Financing or the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Buyer shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the Equity
Commitment Letters in any manner that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Buyer shall furnish Seller complete, correct and executed copies of any
amendments or modifications to any Equity Commitment Letter within two (2)
Business Days after the execution thereof.

(c) Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt notice of (i) any material breach
or default by any party to any Equity Commitment Letter of which Buyer becomes
aware or (ii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any financing source with respect to any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Equity Commitment Letters of any provision
thereof.

Section 6.15 Supplement to Seller Disclosure Schedules. From time to time
prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Schedules hereto with 

respect to any matter hereafter arising or of which it becomes aware after the
date hereof (each a "Schedule Supplement"). Any disclosure in any such
Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained
in this Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 have been satisfied.

Section 6.16 StarStone Brazil. Seller shall, at its own cost and expense, use
its commercially reasonable efforts to wind up the affairs of StarStone
Brazil. Buyer acknowledges that such efforts may extend past the Closing Date
and Buyer shall provide Seller with such cooperation as Seller shall
reasonably request to complete such wind up of StarStone Brazil, including
making officers and employees of StarStone Brazil and the Acquired Companies
available to provide any information, documents, records or attestations that
may be required to complete the wind up. Buyer shall not, and shall cause
StarStone Brazil and the Acquired Companies not to, conduct any business in or
from StarStone Brazil after the Closing Date. Buyer shall promptly send to
Seller a copy of any written notices (or a summary of any oral notices)
received by StarStone Brazil, Buyer or the Acquired Companies from a
Governmental Body or any other Person regarding StarStone Brazil. If Buyer is
required by any Governmental Body to contribute any capital to StarStone
Brazil so that it can satisfy its liabilities and obligations, Seller shall
promptly reimburse Buyer for the amount of such capital contribution. If Buyer
is entitled to receive a capital distribution from StarStone Brazil, Buyer
shall cooperate with Seller to cause such capital distribution to be made and
then Buyer shall promptly remit the amount of such capital distribution to
Seller.

Section 6.17 Transition Matters.

furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, (i) agree on the Transition
Services Agreement, and (ii) cooperate in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to develop a mutually acceptable transition

Intellectual Property will continue to be made available to the Business after
the Closing (e.g. assignment or partition of the applicable Contract or
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement), it being understood that
Buyer, its Affiliates or one of the Acquired Companies will bear their
respective share of any licensing or other fees, costs and expenses associated
with such Intellectual Property used by the Acquired Companies after the

such real property is (or, following the Closing, will be) used both in
connection with the business of the Seller and its Affiliates and the
Business, by entering into sub-leases with Seller, its Affiliates or Third
Parties, partitioning office space with Seller or its Affiliates (so long as
the applicable landlord consents (if consent is required)) or effecting such
other arrangements as the Parties may mutually agree upon, including new
leases for such real property with the applicable landlord;

(iii) an arrangement under which Business Employees would assist the Reinsurer

Parties may mutually agree upon; 

(iv) the transition of certain IT Systems and Software used in connection with
the Business to Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies)

Services Agreement; and

(v) the separation of the Business from the international business of Sellers
and its Affiliates operated under the StarStone Name following the Closing,
including any assets, customers, vendors, Intellectual Property and business
operations shared between them.

Law, each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
appoint a transition manager who would be the primary contact for such Party
in connection with the further development and execution of the Transition
Plan and (ii) cooperate to establish regular meetings of the Parties'
transition teams during the period between the date of this Agreement and the

Acquired Companies, the Business or the operations, assets or liabilities in
respect thereof and Buyer shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for the Acquired Companies, the Business and the

writing. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Guarantor acknowledges that
Buyer may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action
against the Guarantor for the full amount of the Obligations, regardless of
whether action is brought against Seller, or whether Seller is joined in any
such action or actions. The Guarantor promises and undertakes to make all
payments required pursuant to this Section 7.1 free and clear of any
deduction, offset, claim or counterclaim of any kind. The Guarantee shall
terminate upon the full payment (in cash), performance, observation and
discharge of the Obligations.

Section 7.2 Nature of Guarantee. Subject to the express terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Guarantor's liability pursuant to this Article VII is
absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective of any
modification, amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the
Agreement. Buyer shall not be required to proceed against Seller first before
proceeding against the Guarantor hereunder.

Section 7.3 Changes in Obligations. The Guarantor agrees that Buyer may, in
its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, without notice to or
further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the
Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Seller for the extension,
renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in
part, without in any way impairing or affecting the Guarantor's obligations
under this Article VII or affecting the validity or enforceability of the
Guarantee. The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in 

part, or otherwise affected by (a) any failure or delay on the part of Buyer
in asserting any claim or demand, or to enforce any right or remedy, against
Seller; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment or performance
of any of the Obligations, or any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement (it being understood that any amendments or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement with respect to the Obligations
shall apply equally to the Guarantor's obligation with respect thereto under
the Guarantee); (c) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or
other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Obligations or

marshaling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy,

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (f) the existence of any
claim, set-off or other right which the Guarantor may have at any time against
Buyer or Seller, whether in connection with the Obligations or otherwise; (g)
the adequacy of any other means Buyer may have of obtaining payment related to
the Obligations; or (h) the value, genuineness, validity, regularity,
illegality or enforceability of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance
with its terms. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Guarantor hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law
which would otherwise require any election of remedies by Buyer. The Guarantor
waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Guarantee and of
the Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all
other notices of any kind (in each case, other than notices required to be
made to Seller pursuant to this Agreement), all defenses which may be
available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar
Law now or hereafter in effect or any right to require the marshaling of
assets of an Seller or any other Person (including the Guarantor) now or
hereafter liable with respect to the Obligations or otherwise interested in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Guarantor acknowledges
that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in
this Section 7.3 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. The
Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not assert as a defense in
any proceeding to enforce the Guarantee that the Guarantee is illegal, invalid
or unenforceable in accordance with its terms.

successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper

result of or arising out of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of the
representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in Section 5.1, Section 5.2,
Section 5.3(a)(i), Section 5.4 and Section 5.7, (ii) any inaccuracy in or
breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in Article V
(other than the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1,
Section 5.2, Section 5.3(a)(i), Section 5.4 and Section 5.7), and (iii)
Buyer's breach of any Pre-Closing Covenant of Buyer or any Post-Closing
Covenant of Buyer. 

(c) Certain Limitations.

(i) In no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification for
any Losses arising from a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
10.2a)(i) (A) for any claim or series of related claims arising from the same
set of facts with respect to which the aggregate amount of Losses does not
exceed $100,000 and (B) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses
under all claims under Section 10.2a)(i) exceeds one million dollars
($1,000,000) (the "Deductible"), at which time Seller shall only be liable for
any Losses in excess of the Deductible.

(ii) In no event shall the aggregate Liability for indemnification by Seller
pursuant to Section 10.2a)(i) exceed in the aggregate sixteen million dollars
($16,000,000) and in no event shall the aggregate Liability for
indemnification by Seller pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Purchase
Price.

(iii) In no event shall any Seller Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification
for any Losses arising from a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
10.2(b)(i) (A) for any claim or series of related claims arising from the same
set of facts with respect to which the aggregate amount of Losses does not
exceed $100,000 and (B) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses
under all claims under Section 10.2(b)(i) exceeds the Deductible, at which
time Buyer shall only be liable for any Losses in excess of the Deductible.

(iv) In no event shall the aggregate Liability for indemnification by Buyer
pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(i) exceed in the aggregate sixteen million dollars
($16,000,000) and in no event shall the aggregate Liability for
indemnification by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Purchase Price.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Section
10.2c)i) to (iv) shall not apply to the extent that the Indemnified Party's
Losses result from or arise out of Fraud by the Indemnifying Party.

(d) The amount of any and all Losses under this Article X shall be (A) (i)
reduced by the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized in the Taxable year
in which such Loss was accrued, incurred or paid as a cash tax savings by any
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual,
incurrence or payment of any such Losses or the immediately succeeding two (2)
Tax years and (ii) increased by the amount of any Tax imposed on any Buyer
Indemnitee as a result of the indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section
10.2 (including any Tax imposed on increased amounts payable under this
Section 10.2(d)(A)(ii)); and (B) determined net of any insurance or other
indemnification proceeds received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification net
of any cost of receiving insurance or other indemnification proceeds and any
increased insurance costs resulting from such claim, including any retroactive
or prospective premium adjustments associated with such coverage, as such
amounts are determined in accordance with those policies and programs
generally applicable from time to time, and only after first applying any
available insurance to the portion of a Loss that is not indemnified
hereunder.

(e) For purposes of this Article X, for purposes of determining any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty and the amount of any Losses to
which a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, is entitled
hereunder, will be determined without any materiality qualifiers (including
any Company Material Adverse Effect) contained in the relevant representations
and warranties.

Section 10.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days
of becoming aware of the circumstances giving raise to the claim or potential
claim) notify the party liable for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party") in writing (such notice, a "Claim Notice") of any pending or
threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has determined gives or
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under
this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by
a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a "Third Party
Claim") (an "Indemnification Claim"). The failure to give such prompt Claim
Notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Each Claim Notice will,
with respect to each Indemnification Claim set forth therein, (i) specify in
reasonable detail and in good faith the nature of the Indemnification Claim
being made and (ii) estimate in good faith the aggregate dollar amount of
Losses suffered or reasonably expected 

to be suffered by such Indemnified Party and for which such Indemnified Party
claims to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article X (the
"Claim Amount").

(b) If the Indemnifying Party wishes to object to the allowance of some or all
Indemnification Claims made in a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party must
deliver a written objection to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
Business Days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Notice
expressing such objection and explaining in reasonable detail and in good
faith the basis therefor. Following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying Party's written objection, if any, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) Business
Days, meet to agree on the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each Indemnification Claim that is the subject of such written objection. If
the parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be
mutually prepared, and executed, by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party and, as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days following the execution of such memorandum, subject to Section
10.3d), the Indemnifying Party will pay the agreed amount to the Indemnified
Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party do
not mutually prepare and execute such a memorandum or such memorandum does not
address in full the written objections timely delivered, within thirty (30)
Business Days of receipt by the Indemnified Party, from the Indemnifying Party
of the written objection, then the Indemnified Party may seek to resolve any
dispute and to seek enforcement of the obligation with respect to the
Indemnification Claim in any court available therefor in accordance with the
terms of Section 11.7.

(c) If the Indemnified Party does not receive a response from the Indemnifying
Party with respect to any Indemnification Claim set forth in a Claim Notice by
the end of the thirty (30) Business Day period referred to in Section 10.3b),
the Indemnified Party shall send a second Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party relating to such Indemnification Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party that it disputes such Indemnification Claim
within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of such second Claim Notice
with respect to such Indemnification Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party will be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to object to such Indemnification
Claim and to have agreed that Losses in the amount of the applicable Claim
Amount are indemnifiable hereunder and (ii) with respect to the subject
Indemnification Claim, as promptly as practicable and within ten (10) Business
Days following expiration of such period, subject to Section 10.3d), the
Indemnifying Party will pay the Claim Amount to the Indemnified Party. If not
paid, the Indemnified Party may seek enforcement of the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to the Indemnification Claim in any court
available therefor in accordance with the terms of Section 11.7.

(d) Any amount payable by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 10.3b) or Section 10.3c) above will be paid by the
Indemnifying Party by wire transfer in dollars in immediately available funds
to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the Indemnified
Party.

(e) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.3a), the Indemnifying Party will be
entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim (or sooner if
notice of the Third Party Claim so requires), to assume the defense and
control of such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party).
Upon delivery of such notice, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the
Indemnified Party under this Article X for any fees of other counsel or any
other expenses with the respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim,
provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (i) involving a criminal claim
or regulatory enforcement action, (ii) involving relief other than monetary
damages, other than a Third Party Claim of infringement or misappropriation of
Intellectual Property rights seeking both injunctive relief and monetary
damages or (iii) if the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by
outside counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim
pursuant to this Section 10.3, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume and control such defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause each of their
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and witnesses and
access to real and personal property, as appropriate, for any defense of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and
control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified
Party; provided that (A) such settlement or judgment does not (1) impose any
equitable or other non-monetary remedies or obligations on the Indemnified 

Party but involves solely the payment of money damages for which the
Indemnified Party will be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party hereunder and
(2) involve a finding or admission of any violation of Law, and (B) the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain, as a condition of any settlement, a complete
and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party potentially affected by
such Third Party Claim from all Liability with respect to such Third Party
Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, with such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such claim if it (x) irrevocably waives in writing delivered
to the Indemnifying Party any right to indemnity therefor under this
Agreement, (y) does not impose any equitable or other non-monetary remedies or
obligations on the Indemnifying Party and (z) does not involve a finding or
admission of any violation of Law.

Section 10.4 Mitigation; No Duplication; No Circular Recovery. Each
Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate its respective
Losses (including using commercially reasonable efforts to recover under
applicable insurance policies or other indemnities and incurring costs only to
the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such
Losses) upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable under
this Agreement. In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to
duplicate compensation with respect to the same Loss under more than one
provision of this Agreement or the other documents entered into in connection
with this Agreement. No Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article X for any Losses to the extent such Losses were specifically included
in the calculation of the Tangible Book Value or the Final Cash Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.5. Without limiting the generality of the prior
sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events constitutes a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to an
indemnification obligation under this Article X, then only one recovery of
indemnifiable Losses shall be allowed, and in no event shall there be any
indemnification or duplication of payments or recovery under different
provisions of this Agreement arising out of the same facts, conditions or
events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any
organizational documents of any Acquired Company, Seller shall not be entitled
to exculpation, indemnification or contribution from Buyer or, after Closing,
any Acquired Company for or in connection with any facts or circumstances that
are the subject matter of or related to an indemnification claim under this
Article X brought by any Buyer Indemnitee.

Section 10.5 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, this Article X will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parties for money damages from and after the Closing Date for
any claims arising under this Agreement, including claims of inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder;
provided, however, that the foregoing will not be deemed a waiver by any Party
of any right to seek specific performance or injunctive relief pursuant to
Section 11.8.

Section 10.6 Tax Treatment. Any indemnification payments made under this
Article X shall be treated for Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by Law,
as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Section 11.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of
Buyer, Seller and the Guarantor will bear its own Taxes, fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including legal,
accounting and other advisory fees and expenses, whether or not such
transactions are consummated.

Section 11.3 Entire Agreement; Modification. This Agreement (together with the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, the Buyer Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents referred to herein) sets forth the entire agreement
and understanding between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreement or
understanding, written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement. No amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in
writing by the Party to be bound thereby, and in accordance with Section
11.12. 

Section 11.4 Assignment; Binding Effect; Severability. This Agreement, and the
rights, interests, obligations and Liabilities hereunder, may not be assigned
by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any
proposed assignment of this Agreement or the rights, interests, obligations
and Liabilities hereunder in violation hereof shall be void ab initio and of
no force or effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the successors and permitted assigns of each
Party. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. In the event that any
one or more provisions are deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable
Law the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect unless the
deletion of such provision shall cause this Agreement to become materially
adverse to any Party, in which event the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to arrive at an accommodation that best preserves the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.5 Governing Law. This Agreement and all litigation, claims,
actions, suits, hearings or proceedings (whether civil, criminal or
administrative and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or
indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of Seller or Buyer
in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof or
thereof, shall be interpreted and governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 11.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE EACH OF ITS AFFILIATES TO WAIVE,
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THE EQUITY FINANCING, OR THE
ACTIONS OF A PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY OR
ITS AFFILIATES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (C) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.6.

Section 11.7 Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 2.5, each of the Parties hereby
(a) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any United States federal court or other state court
located in the State of Delaware having jurisdiction over such dispute) in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any United States federal court or
other state court located in the State of Delaware having jurisdiction over
such dispute); provided that each of the Parties shall have the right to bring
any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by any United
States federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court in any other court or jurisdiction.

Section 11.8 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist, and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the Parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance
of the terms hereof, without requiring proof of damages or posting of a bond.
The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative (and not
alternative). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Seller shall
only be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Buyer to draw down the
full proceeds of the Equity Financing or to cause Buyer to effect the Closing
in accordance with Section 2.2, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, if (a) all conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been
satisfied as of the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.2 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing), (b) Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing
is required to have occurred 

pursuant to Section 2.2 and (c) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Buyer that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is
funded, then the Closing will occur.

Section 11.9 No Recourse; Sole and Exclusive Remedy.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and the
Guarantor each acknowledge and agree, both for themselves and their respective
Subsidiaries, stockholders and Affiliates, that no recourse under, based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters or
any documents or agreements referenced therein may be had by any of them
against any Affiliate of Buyer, any other Person or any such Affiliate's or
other Person's respective direct or indirect former, current or future
Affiliates, general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling persons,
equityholders, managers, managing companies, members, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Representatives, advisers, successors or assigns, actual or
prospective financing sources (including the Equity Investors) or arrangers
(in each case other than the Equity Investors, to the extent set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letters, and Dragoneer Global Fund II, L.P., Dragoneer
Opportunities Fund IV, L.P., SkyKnight Capital Fund II, L.P. and Corinthian DC
Holdings, LP, to the extent set forth in their respective equity commitment
letters to Corinthian DF Holdings, LP) (collectively, the "Non-Recourse
Persons"), whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law; provided that the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise
impact Buyer's obligations under this Agreement and Buyer's obligations under
the Equity Commitment Letters.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
Buyer fails to effect the Closing (including due to the fact that the Equity
Financing is not available to Buyer), Seller's sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) (other than in
connection with Fraud for which all applicable legal and equitable remedies
shall be available to Seller) against the Non-Recourse Persons shall be the
seeking of an order of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by Section 11.8, and Seller shall not be entitled to bring
or maintain any Action for monetary damages against any of the foregoing
Persons in connection therewith or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

Section 11.10 Execution in Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party and the
Guarantor shall have received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by
facsimile, email of a pdf attachment or otherwise) by each of the Parties and
the Guarantor.

Section 11.11 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall (a) confer on any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights
(including third party beneficiary rights), or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement or (b) constitute the Parties as partners or as participants in
a joint venture. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall not provide Third Parties with any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of those
existing without reference to the terms of this Agreement. No Third Party
shall have any right, independent of any right that exists irrespective of
this Agreement, under or granted by this Agreement, to bring any suit at Law
or equity for any matter governed by or subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

Section 11.12 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended with respect
to any provision contained herein by action of the Parties taken by their
boards of directors or by their duly authorized officers or employees, whether
before or after such Party's action. Any term or condition hereof may be
waived by the Party which is entitled to the benefits thereof by action taken
by its board of directors or its duly authorized officer or employee, whether
before or after the action of such Party. Any such amendment or waiver shall
be evidenced by a written instrument duly executed on behalf of each Party by
its duly authorized officer or employee. The failure of any Party to enforce
at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a
waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity of this
Agreement or the right of such Party thereafter to enforce each and every such
provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
