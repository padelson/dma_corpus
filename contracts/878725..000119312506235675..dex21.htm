cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles
of Merger"), including a plan of merger, in accordance with Section 55-11-05
of the North Carolina Act, with the Secretary of State of the State of North

such other time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Articles
of Merger (the time of such filing, or such other time so specified, being

SECTION 2.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in Section 55-11-06 of the North Carolina Act.

SECTION 2.5 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time at or after the Effective

the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger
Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise,
all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise
to carry out this Agreement.

SECTION 2.6 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. (a)
At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by Applicable Law and such articles of incorporation; provided,
however, Article I of the Articles of Incorporation shall be amended at the
Effective Time to read: "The name of the Corporation is Embrex, Inc."

(b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by Applicable Law, the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.



 

\- 4 - (c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will
continue as the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and except as Merger
Sub may otherwise notify the Company in writing prior to the Effective Time,
the officers of the Company immediately before the Effective Time will be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
successors are elected or appointed and qualified. If, at the Effective Time,
a vacancy shall exist on the board of directors or in any office of the
Surviving Corporation, such vacancy may thereafter be filled in the
manner provided by law.

SECTION 2.7 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Except as provided in clause (b) below, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (including
for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Restricted Stock (as defined in
Section 2.9) for which vesting has been, or will be, accelerated at or prior
to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 2.9) and/or any agreements related thereto) and any Rights (as defined
in Section 4.2) associated therewith (such shares of Company Common Stock and
associated Rights are hereinafter referred to, together, as the "Shares")
shall be converted into the right to receive $17.00 (the "Per Share Amount")
in cash payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such Share or an affidavit with respect thereto,
in each case in accordance with Section 2.8. As of the Effective Time, all
Shares so converted shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates representing any such Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except to receive the aggregate Per Share
Amount applicable thereto, in accordance with Section 2.8.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or held
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and no
cash, Company Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor. 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
extinguished and shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.8 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. (a) Before the
Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a bank or trust
company (which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as
agent for the holders of Shares (the "Exchange Agent") to receive the funds
necessary to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a) and to make such
payments on a timely basis. The Surviving Corporation shall, at the Effective
Time, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, funds in
an amount sufficient for the payments under Section 2.8(b) to which such
holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.7(a).
Such funds shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation, provided however that such funds may only be invested
in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States, (ii) commercial
paper rated A-1, P-1 or



 

\- 5 - A-2, P-2, and (iii) time deposits with, including certificates of deposits
issued by, any office located in the United States of any bank or trust
company organized under federal law or under the law of any state of the
United States or of the District of Columbia and that has capital, surplus and
undivided profits of at least $500,000,000. Any net profits resulting from,
or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable as
directed by Parent.

(b) The Surviving Corporation agrees that as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time it shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute to holders of
record of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of
transmittal and instructions for its use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates representing the Shares in exchange for the aggregate Per Share
Amount relating thereto in customary form to be agreed to by Parent and
Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon the surrender of certificates
representing the Shares together with a properly executed letter of
transmittal, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay
the holder of such certificates in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal
to the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares represented by
such certificate or certificates. Until so surrendered, each such certificate
(other than certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock held by
the Company or held by Parent or Merger Sub) shall represent solely the right
to receive the aggregate Per Share Amount relating thereto.

(c) If payment of cash in respect of canceled Shares is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered certificate or
instrument is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
certificate or instrument so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of
such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of
the certificate or instrument surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent that such tax
either has been paid or is not payable.

(d) If any certificate or certificates representing Shares shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such certificate or certificates to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent may require as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such certificate or certificates,
the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate or certificates the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of
Shares represented by such certificate or certificates payable pursuant to
this Agreement.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after
the Effective Time, certificates for Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in
Section 2.7(a). No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon
the surrender of a certificate or certificates that immediately before the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares.



 

\- 6 - (f) Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective Time,
Parent may cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to the Surviving Corporation
all cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and any holder of a certificate or
certificates representing Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Per Share
Amount multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such certificate or
certificates, subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. Thereafter, each holder of a certificate or certificates formerly
representing Shares that did not receive the aggregate Per Share Amount
relating thereto may surrender such certificate or certificates to Parent
and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws)
receive in consideration thereof the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number
of Shares represented by such certificate or certificates, without any
interest or dividends thereon. 

(g) None of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any Person in respect of cash delivered by the Exchange Agent to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

(h) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of a certificate or
certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such
certificate or certificates.

(i) The Per Share Amount paid in the Merger shall be net to the holder of
Shares in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable back-up withholding
or, as set forth in Section 2.8(c), stock transfer taxes payable by such
holder, or any other withholding that is required to be made under Applicable
Law.

(j) Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange
Agent, in connection with the exchange of cash for Shares.

SECTION 2.9 _Stock Plans; Stock Purchase Plans_. (a) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, all options then outstanding to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (the "Company Stock Options") heretofore granted under any plan,
arrangement or agreement (collectively, the "Stock Plans") shall become fully
vested and exercisable (whether or not currently exercisable). At the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option not theretofore exercised shall be
canceled. Any restricted stock ("Restricted Stock") or restricted stock unit
award ("RSU Awards") with respect to Company Common Stock granted under any
Stock Plan that is unvested at the Effective Time (or that does not vest (on
an accelerated basis or otherwise) as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby) shall be immediately forfeited by the recipient as of the
Effective Time. Subject to this Section 2.9, (1) each holder of a Company
Stock Option that is canceled pursuant to this Section 2.9(a) shall, in
respect of each Company Stock Option, be entitled to cash payment by the
Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x)
the Per Share Amount over (y) the applicable exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company
Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to such cancellation, and (2)
each vested RSU Award as of the Effective Time



 

\- 7 - shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment
equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by the vested RSU Award. The foregoing cash payments
shall be made by the Surviving Corporation upon or as soon as practicable
after delivery by such holder of such holders written agreement or
acknowledgment that all RSU Awards and Company Stock Options held by such
holder have been cancelled as a result of the Merger in exchange for such cash
payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that the Company
Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Stock
Plans), shall adopt such resolutions and take all actions otherwise necessary
(including obtaining any required consents) such that all Company Stock
Options, RSU Awards and shares of Restricted Stock outstanding under the
Stock Plans are treated in accordance with this Section 2.9. The Company shall
terminate all Company Stock Plans as of or prior to the Effective Time.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.9 to any holder of
RSU Awards or Company Stock Options such amounts as the Surviving Corporation
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code (as defined in Section 4.10(c)), or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
RSU Awards or Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) The rights of participants in the Companys employee stock purchase plans
(the "Employee Stock Purchase Plans") with respect to any offering period then
underway under such plans shall be determined by shortening the offering
period as required by the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plans and by
making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period by otherwise treating such shortened offering period
as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under
such plans; provided, however, that no participant shall be allowed to
increase the current level of payroll deductions under, and no employee shall
be allowed to enroll in, the Employee Stock Purchase Plans from or after the
date hereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including, if appropriate, amending the terms of such plans) that are
necessary or appropriate to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.9(c). The Company shall terminate all Employee Stock Purchase
Plans as of or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall not commence any
new offering periods under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans after the date of
this Agreement.

\- 16 - (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) will (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.9(a)

intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and
has either (i) timely received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
that the Plan is so qualified or (ii) is entitled to rely on a favorable
opinion letter issued by the IRS to a provider of the Companys prototype
401(k) plan, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of
such determination letter or opinion letter which has resulted, or is
reasonably likely to result in the Companys inability to rely on such letter.
There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section

providing such information to Parent); and (iii) promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) provide to Parent a copy of all written inquiries, proposals

Company in connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal during the twelve
(12) months prior to the date of this Agreement, to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its
behalf.

(d) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings set forth
below:

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether in

equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender

beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or 15% or more of the equity interest in the
Company.

(ii) "Third Party" means any Person or group other than the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates.

(e) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2, the Company Board of Directors
shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
the approval or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (any such agreement, a "Company Acquisition Agreement").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or the limitations imposed by Section
5.2(b)(iii), in the event that prior to the time when the Companys
shareholder approval of the Merger is obtained and upon having received an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is not, directly or
indirectly, the result of a breach of this Section 5.2, if the Company Board
of Directors (A) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Company Superior Proposal (as defined below), and (B) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
do so would be contrary to its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders
under Applicable Law, the Company Board of Directors may (subject to this and
the following sentences) (x) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation
of this Agreement or the Merger or (y) approve or recommend a Company
Superior Proposal, but in each of the cases set forth in this clause (y), only
at a time that is at least 72 hours following delivery to Parent of a written
notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors has received a
Company Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Company Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Company
Superior Proposal.



 

\- 32 - For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal in writing pursuant to which a
Third Party would acquire all or substantially all of the Companys assets, or
at least 50% of the capital stock of the Company and on financial terms which
the Company Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its financial advisors) to be more favorable to the
Companys shareholders, from a financial point of view, than the Merger
(taking into account any factors relating to such proposed transaction deemed
relevant by the Company Board of Directors, including, without limitation, the
financing thereof and all other conditions thereto).

(f) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b), (c) and (e) of this Section 5.2, the Company shall no later than 24 hours
after the receipt thereof advise Parent orally and in writing of any

of Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, is required under
Applicable Law.

such occurrence or discovery, and, with the cooperation of Parent, the
Company shall file with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,

contracts, commitments, records and personnel, material suppliers,
contractors, customers and distributors of the Company or any of its

provided that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to matters occurring before the Effective Time) with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under
this Section 6.5(b) which in the aggregate exceed 250% of the current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such purpose; provided that the
Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage, with respect to the entire six year period following the Effective
Time, as may be obtained for such 250% amount. The provisions of clause (ii)
of this subsection (b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if promptly
after the Closing, Parent purchases or causes the Surviving Corporation to
purchase, for up to 250% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company,
a prepaid ("tail") policy or policies of officers and directors liability
insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which policy or policies
(together with the Companys existing policy) shall have a claim period of not
less than six years from the Closing Date and shall be no less advantageous
to the Indemnified Parties than the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company. If the



 

\- 37 - premium(s) of the insurance coverage required to be purchased by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation exceed the amounts set forth above, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated only to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If either the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.5. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.5, including without limitation, all expenses (including attorneys
fees) that may be incurred by the Indemnified Parties in enforcing this
Section 6.5, provided that neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall have
any obligations to pay any such expenses unless and until the Indemnified
Party provides Parent and Surviving Corporation with an undertaking to repay
such expenses if such Indemnified Party is not successful in enforcing this
Section 6.5.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 6.5 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

SECTION 6.6 _Employee Benefit Matters_. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall comply with the terms of, and honor and satisfy all liabilities
with respect to, or cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with the terms
of, and honor and satisfy all liabilities with respect to, all Company Benefit
Plans. Subject to the foregoing sentence, nothing herein shall require Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to continue any particular Company Benefit Plan
or prevent the amendment or termination thereof. Subject to the first two
sentences of this Section 6.6, from and after the Effective Time until the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates shall
provide the employees of the Company at the Effective Time (the "Employees")
with employee benefits (excluding equity compensation, severance and any
payments or other benefits made by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) that are not less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits provided to such persons immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Following the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by law, each Employee
shall receive full credit for all years of service with the Company for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of
benefit accrual or level of benefits) for employee benefit plan purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the provisions contained herein shall
operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Employee or the funding of
any such benefit. Following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will (i) use reasonable best efforts to cause Employees who
participate in any medical, dental or vision-type benefit plan that is
intended to replace a Company Benefit Plan of the same type to (x) be eligible
to participate in such plan without any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or application of any pre-existing condition restrictions (except
to the extent any such limitation has not been satisfied or such restriction
applies under any applicable Company



 

\- 38 - Benefit Plan in which the participant then participates or is otherwise
eligible to participate), and (y) receive appropriate credit for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket limits for
the applicable plan year; and (ii) provide each Employee credit, for purposes
of Parents and the Surviving Corporations vacation and/or other paid leave
benefits programs, for such Employees accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid
leave balance as of the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 6.6
shall not create in any Employee any rights to employment or continued
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries and nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, is intended
to confer on any person other than the parties hereto any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which is likely to cause
any condition to the obligations of any of the parties hereto not to be
satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.7 shall not have any effect for the purpose of determining
the satisfaction of the conditions to the obligations of any of the parties
hereto or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any of
the parties sending or receiving such notice.

SECTION 6.8 _Resignations_. The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent at
the Closing (i) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignations of all directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries from
their respective boards of directors and of the resignations from office with
the Company of those officers of the Company specified by Parent reasonably in
advance of the Closing and, in each case, effective at the Effective Time and
(ii) all documents and filings, completed and executed by the appropriate
directors, officers and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
that are necessary to record the resignations contemplated by the preceding
clause (i). The Company and Parent agree that each such resignation as an
officer or director does not terminate the employment relationship with the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary, and shall be without prejudice to any
rights that such director or officer may have under any existing employment,
severance or other similar agreement with the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary or under Applicable Law.

SECTION 6.9 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each
other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the
Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and to terminate registration under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that such delisting and termination shall not
be effective until after the Effective Time.

things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.11.

by action taken by each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company at any time

Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties hereto.

SECTION 9.13 _Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, any party hereto

other parties hereto with any of their agreements or conditions contained

waiver shall be valid only as against such party and only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

SECTION 9.14 _Schedule and Exhibits_. All Schedules and Exhibits referred to
herein are intended to be and hereby are specifically made a part of this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
