(b) any intercompany accounts and other intercompany obligations required to
be settled or eliminated at or prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section
5.7_, or (c) any assets or liabilities in respect of Income Taxes. For
purposes of this Agreement, Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance
with this Agreement (including the sample calculation of the Adjustment
Amount as of December 31, 2014 set forth on _Exhibit C_ (the " _Sample
Adjustment Amount Statement_ ")) and with GAAP applied using the same data
sources, policies, procedures and method of calculation, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in
preparation of the Business Balance Sheet; _provided_ , _however_ , Working
Capital shall not be calculated to include any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting as a consequence of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby other than as expressly set forth in the
Sample Adjustment Amount Statement; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that
if there is any conflict between the accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures used in preparing the Business Balance
Sheet and GAAP, GAAP shall control and no reversal of any reserves reflected
in the balance sheet of the Transferred Entities shall be taken into account
except that reserved for a litigation matter may be reversed only in
connection with the final resolution of such litigation and reserves against
an account receivable may be reversed only upon actual collection of such
reserved receivable (the methods set forth in this definition of Working
Capital, the " _Accounting Methodology_ ").

 

" _Zogenix Products_ " shall mean the Transferred Entities Zohydro ER, an

-16- ARTICLE II

 

THE SALE

2.1 _The Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ "), Sellers shall transfer, convey, assign and
deliver to Acquisition Sub, and Acquisition Sub shall purchase and acquire
from Sellers, all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the
Transferred Interests (the " _Sale_ ").

 

2.2 _Purchase Price; Allocation_.

 

(a) In consideration for the Transferred Interests, Purchasers shall pay to
Sellers an aggregate of (a) Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in cash (the
" _Initial Purchase Price_ ") plus (b) the Warrant (collectively, the "
_Purchase Price_ ") at the Closing. The Initial Purchase Price shall be
subject to adjustment as provided in  _Section 2.4_ through _Section 2.7_.

(b) The Parties agree that:

 

(i) For U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, the sale of (A) the Transferred
Interests in Alkermes Gainesville (which is a disregarded entity with respect
to Eagle Holdings) shall be treated as a sale of the assets of Alkermes
Gainesville and (B) the Transferred Interests in Newco (which is a disregarded
entity with respect to APIL) shall be treated as a sale of the assets of
Newco;

(ii) An amount of the Initial Purchase Price equal to the lesser of (A) the
Appraised Value of Alkermes Gainesville (as determined pursuant to Section
2.2(d)) less any liabilities of Alkermes Gainesville that are required to be
treated as part of the purchase price of the assets of Alkermes Gainesville
for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes and (B) the Initial Purchase Price shall
be allocated to, and paid to Eagle Holdings in full payment for the
Transferred Interests in Alkermes Gainesville; and

 

(iii) The balance of the Initial Purchase Price plus the Warrant shall be
allocated to and paid to APIL in full payment for the Transferred Interests
in Newco and the Earn-Out Consideration shall be allocated to and paid to APIL
in full payment of the amounts due under the terms of the IP License
Agreement.

 

(c) The right of APIL to receive the Earn-Out Consideration: (i) is solely a
contractual right and is not a security for purposes of any federal or state
securities Laws; (ii) will not be represented by any form of certificate or
instrument; and (iii) does not give APIL any dividend rights, voting rights,
liquidation rights, preemptive rights or other rights common to holders of
the equity securities of Acquisition Sub or any of its Affiliates. The
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are intended to be, and shall be
treated solely as, a sale of the Transferred Interests by Sellers to
Acquisition Sub, and nothing hereunder shall be deemed to create a joint
venture or partnership between or among any of the Parties, the Transferred
Entities and/or any of their Affiliates.

 



-17- (d) Eagle Holdings shall retain Duff and Phelps Corporation which shall conduct
an appraisal and determine the gross fair market value of the assets of
Alkermes Gainesville (the " _Appraised Value_ "). Within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Eagle Holdings shall deliver to Purchasers a schedule
setting forth the Appraised Value and the allocation of the Initial Purchase
Price allocable to the Transferred Interests in Alkermes Gainesville (as
determined pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii)) (plus any liabilities of Alkermes
Gainesville that are required to be treated as part of the purchase price of
the assets of Alkermes Gainesville for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes) among
the asset classes of Alkermes Gainesville (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "),
with the asset classes being those set forth in Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.338-6. The
Allocation Schedule will not allocate to various assets within the asset
class. The Appraised Value and Allocation Schedule shall be subject to such
appropriate adjustments, if any, by the appraisers and Eagle Holdings upon
the determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment. The Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. The Appraised
Value and Allocation Schedule shall be deemed final unless Purchasers notify
Eagle Holdings in writing that Purchasers object to the Appraised Value and/or
one or more items reflected in the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Allocation Schedule to Purchasers. In the event of any
such objection, Sellers and Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if Sellers and Purchasers are
unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days after the delivery
of the Allocation Schedule to Sellers, such dispute shall be resolved by an
impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants mutually appointed by Sellers and Purchasers whose determination
shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchasers, on the other hand; provided, however, that if one such side
substantially prevails in such dispute, then the non-prevailing Party(ies)
shall bear all such fees and expenses. For the avoidance of doubt a Party
shall be deemed to have "substantially prevailed" if the final determination
by the accounting firm, in the case of Purchasers, is at least twenty percent
(20%) greater than the Appraised Value, and, in the case of Sellers, is not
more than twenty percent (20%) greater than the Appraised Value. Sellers and
Purchasers agree to file their respective IRS Forms 8594 and all Tax Returns
in accordance with the Allocation Schedule. Neither Purchasers nor Sellers
shall take any position in a filed Income Tax Return or statement that is
inconsistent with such allocations and Purchasers and Sellers will use
reasonable efforts to sustain such position in any Tax Proceeding.

(e) Purchasers shall have the right to withhold all Taxes it is required by
Law to withhold from all payments made hereunder, and will provide Sellers
with proof of deposit or payment of any such Taxes withheld. For the avoidance
of doubt, however, in connection with the sale of the Transferred Interests in
Newco, APIL shall provide to Purchasers a valid and properly completed
W-8BEN-E establishing its status as the beneficial owner for purposes of the
U.S.-Ireland Treaty of those payments to APIL of the Purchase Price
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, portions of the Initial Purchase
Price, the Warrant and the Earn-Out Consideration) made under Section
2.2(b)(ii) and so long as APIL has provided Purchasers with such a W-8BEN-E
that has not expired, Purchasers shall treat all such payments to APIL as
exempt from U.S. federal Income Tax pursuant to the Code and/or Article 12 or
Article 13 of

 



-18-  the U.S.-Ireland Income Tax Treaty. In addition, provided that APIL provides
a form W-8BEN-E upon which Purchasers may rely to show that the payments made
to APIL are not subject to FATCA withholding, Purchasers shall not withhold
any amounts under FATCA from payments to be made to APIL

2.3 _Closing_.

 

(a) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP,
Exchange Place, Boston, MA 02109, at 10:00 a.m., prevailing Eastern time, on

conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that by

minute books, and other statutory books, required to be kept by Law, and, to

(F) deliver to Purchasers (1) copies of all UCC-3 discharge statements to be
filed with respect to Alkermes Gainesville and copies of releases or other

releases under Irish law, for any Lien, including the Liens granted to Morgan
Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as collateral agent, under the Credit Agreement,
dated as of September 25, 2012, as amended on February 14, 2013 and May 22,
2013 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, replaced or

entities

 



-19-  from time to time parties to the Credit Agreement as lenders, Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as co-
syndication agents, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as collateral
agent in favor of the lenders thereunder, on (i) any assets owned by the
Transferred Entities, other than the Excluded Assets or (ii) the Transferred
Interests; and (2) a release of Alkermes Gainesville from its obligations as a
guarantor under the Credit Agreement;

 

(G) deliver to Purchasers a copy of the resolutions or written consent of the

nominee(s)) and voted in favor of the registration of the Acquisition Sub (or
its nominee(s)) as stockholder(s) or member(s), as applicable, of the
Transferred Entities in respect of the Transferred Interests (subject to the
production of duly stamped transfers) and (ii) appointed such persons as
the Purchasers have nominated as directors and secretary of the Transferred
Entities, effective at the Closing; and

(H) deliver to Purchasers certificates dated as of the Closing Date in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchasers, sworn under penalty of
perjury and in form and substance required under the Treasury Regulations
issued pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code stating, as applicable, that
Eagle Holdings is not a "foreign person" as defined in Section 1445 of the
Code and the interests in Newco do not constitute U.S. real property interests
as defined in Section 897(c) of the Code; and

(I) the Forms W-8BEN-E required to be furnished pursuant to Section 2.2(e). 

(ii) Purchasers shall:

 

(A) pay, by wire transfer, to an account or accounts designated by Sellers,
immediately available funds in an amount equal to either: (i) the Initial
Purchase Price plus the Closing Adjustment (if the Closing Adjustment is a
positive amount) or (ii) the Initial Purchase Price minus the Closing
Adjustment (if the Closing Adjustment is a negative amount), in each case as
determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_, to Eagle Holdings in the amount set
forth in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ and the remaining amount, if any, to APIL;

 

(B) deliver to APIL the Warrant, duly executed by Recro;

 

(C) deliver to Seller the Transition Services Agreement, duly executed by

2.4 _Closing Adjustment_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Sellers shall provide Purchasers with a certificate
signed by an officer

 



-20-  of each of the Sellers attaching reasonable and good faith estimates (the "
_Closing Estimates_ ") of each of (i) the Closing Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Closing Cash Amount (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amount_ "); (iii) the Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ "); (iv) the Closing Date Transaction
Fees (the " _Estimated Closing Date Transaction Fees_ "); and (v) the Closing
Adjustment (as defined below). Each of the Closing Estimates shall be
determined in accordance with the Accounting Methodology. Purchasers shall be
entitled to review, and propose reasonable changes to the Closing Estimates
and Sellers shall provide Purchasers and their Representatives with reasonable
access, at reasonable times following prior notice, to the officers,
employees, agreements and books and records of the Transferred Entities to
verify the accuracy of such amounts. The Sellers shall consider the
Purchasers proposed changes in good faith. If the Parties are unable to reach
agreement on any proposed changes, the Closing Estimates (and the components
thereof) as proposed by the Sellers shall control solely for purposes of
payments to be made at Closing and shall not limit or otherwise effect the
Purchasers remedies under this Agreement or otherwise constitute an
acknowledgment by Purchasers of the accuracy of the Closing Estimates. The "
_Closing Adjustment_ " shall equal (i) the Estimated Closing Working Capital,
plus (ii) the Estimated Closing Cash Amount, less (iii) the Target Working
Capital, less (iv) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, and (v) less the
Estimated Closing Date Transaction Fees.

 

2.5 _Post-Closing Statement_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate with each
other and provide each other with such access to their respective books,
records, accountants, audit work papers and relevant employees as they may
reasonably request in connection with the matters addressed in this _Section
2.5_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this  _Section 2.5_
shall require Sellers, Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates to
disclose any attorney-client privileged information to the extent that
disclosure thereof might result in the loss of attorney-client privilege.
As promptly as practicable but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Purchasers shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement (the
" _Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") of (i) the Closing
Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Cash Amount, (iii) the Closing Date
Indebtedness, (iv) the Closing Date Transaction Fees; and (v) the Adjustment
Amount, setting forth Purchasers calculation of the Adjustment Amount as of
the Closing together with reasonable supporting calculations and detail. The
Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be determined in accordance
with the Accounting Methodology.

 

(b) If Sellers disagree in whole or in part with the Initial Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement, Seller shall notify Purchasers in writing of such
disagreement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") within thirty (30) days
following Sellers receipt of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement
(the " _Review Period_ "), indicating the specific line items that are in
dispute (the " _Disputed Items_ "), describing the basis for such objection
and providing Sellers estimate of such Disputed Items; _provided_ that
Sellers and Purchasers shall be deemed to have agreed upon all items and
amounts that are not Disputed Items, unless the resolution of a Disputed Item
affects an undisputed item, in which case such undisputed item shall remain
open and be considered a Disputed Item. If no Notice of Disagreement is
received by Purchasers prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the
Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to have been
accepted by Sellers and shall become final and binding upon the Parties in
accordance with  _Section 2.5(e)_.

 



-21- (c) During the thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Parties may
mutually agree) immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Sellers and Purchasers shall seek
in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to
Disputed Items. The Parties shall cooperate during such Resolution Period and
Sellers and their Representatives shall have access to the books and records,
working papers, schedules and calculations of the Purchasers and the
Transferred Entities used in the preparation of the Initial Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement, the Notice of Disagreement and the determination of the
Disputed Items, and to the personnel involved in the preparation and
calculation thereof, during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice.

 

(d) Dispute Resolution.

 

(i) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Sellers and Purchasers have been
unable to resolve all Disputed Items, Sellers and Purchasers shall submit the
remaining Disputed Items with respect to the Notice of Disagreement (along
with a copy of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement marked to
indicate those line items that are not in dispute) to PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP or, if that firm declines to act as provided in this _Section 2.5(d)_ or
it is determined that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP would not be considered
"independent" under applicable professional standards, another firm of
independent public accountants, selected promptly by and mutually reasonably
acceptable to Purchasers and Sellers (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ").
The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to make, within thirty
(30) days after the expiration of the Resolution Period or, if applicable, the
date of selection of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to the preceding
sentence, a final determination in accordance with this Agreement, binding on
the Parties, of the appropriate amount of each of the Disputed Items which
Sellers and Purchasers have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm,
calculated in accordance with the standards set forth in this Agreement, and
to promptly notify the Parties in writing of its determination. With respect
to each amount in dispute, the Independent Accounting Firms determination, if
not in accordance with the position of either Sellers or Purchasers, shall not
be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated
by Sellers in the Notice of Disagreement or by Purchasers in the Initial Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement with respect to such disputed amount.

 

(ii) During the review by the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchasers and
Sellers will each provide the Independent Accounting Firm with such access to
their respective books, records, accountants, audit work papers and relevant
employees as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.5_;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained in this _Section 2.5_ shall require Sellers,
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates to disclose any attorney-
client privileged information to the extent that disclosure thereof might
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege.

(iii) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be split equally between Sellers, on the
one hand, and Purchasers on the other hand.

 



-22- (e) The version of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement that is final
and binding on the Parties, as determined either through agreement of the
Parties pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ or _Section 2.5(c)_ or through the
action of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)_, is
referred to as the " _Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ ", and the
Adjustment Amount set forth therein as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_."

 

2.6 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be
equal to (i) the Final Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement less (ii) the Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a positive amount, then Purchasers shall pay or cause
Acquisition Sub to pay in cash to Sellers (or one or more
Affiliates designated by Sellers) the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment
via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designed in
writing by the Sellers. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount,
then Sellers (or an Affiliate designated by Sellers) shall pay in cash to
Acquisition Sub the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment via wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designed in writing by the
Acquisition Sub. Any such payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days
after the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement is determined.

2.7 _Calculations_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
the Parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended
to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or a reduction),
more than once in the calculation of (including any component of) the Closing
Estimates, the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement, the Adjustment Amount or any other calculated
amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion
(either as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause such amount to be
over- or under-counted for purposes of such calculation.

 

2.8 _Earn-Out Consideration_. Following the Closing, Purchasers shall pay or
cause Newco to pay to APIL the Earn-Out Consideration, in accordance with the
terms of _Exhibit E_.

to be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS. Sellers have made
available to Purchasers the most recent determination or opinion letter of
the Internal Revenue Service relating to each such Benefit Plan. Any such IRS
determination or opinion letter remains in effect and has not been revoked by
the IRS. Each Benefit Plan has been maintained in material compliance with
its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable
statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code.

Plans which would reasonably be expected to result in any liability of

increase in the rights of any Transferred Entity Employee under any Benefit
Plan. No payment or benefit which is or may be made or provided by, from or
with respect to any Benefit Plan in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to any Transferred Entity Employee constitutes
an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

(f) No Transferred Entity Benefit Plan, or Transferred Entity Employee or
other service provider of the Transferred Entities is, or would reasonably in

Sellers Disclosure Letter, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Sellers does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Reorganization, by the Sellers will not,
constitute or result in a breach or violation of or a default under, or
require consent under, any Contract with a Significant Customer or Significant
Supplier. 

3.23 _Accounts Receivable_. The accounts receivable reflected on the Business

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Purchasers
and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate

to obtain all such Governmental Approvals. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to (A) within ten (10) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement, make all necessary filings and
submissions under the HSR Act, (B) make all other required filings pursuant
to other antitrust or competition Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and (C) not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law, nor enter into any

the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other Parties (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each Party shall
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information or documentation
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
competition Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the

the HSR Act together with the initial filings and submissions under the HSR

referenced in _Section 5.2(a)_ to obtain all Governmental Approvals for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
antitrust or competition Law, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other
in connection with any communication, filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party; (ii) keep the other Party and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the FTC,

hereby; (iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with

permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other
Person, give the other Parties and/or their counsel the opportunity to attend

businesses of Sellers, to the extent permitted by Law. Purchasers and Sellers,
as each deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other under this
_Section 5.2(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Purchasers or Sellers,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in  _Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_, each of Purchasers and
Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on or before the Outside Date. It shall
not be deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions specified in _Section
8.1(a)_ if, as a result of any suit brought by any Person or Governmental
Entity challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violating any antitrust Law, a court enters or the applicable Governmental
Entity makes an order or decree permitting the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, but requiring that any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of Purchasers or their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Subject Assets_
") be divested or held separate by Purchasers, or that would otherwise limit
Purchasers freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to operate and
retain, the Subject Assets.

 

(d) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, each of
Purchasers and Sellers shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
take or agree to take any action that would

 



-45-  reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the Parties from obtaining any
Governmental Approval in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein.

(e) Purchasers agree to provide such security and assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any Governmental Entity or other third party whose consent or approval is
sought in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Whether or not
the Sale is consummated, Purchasers and Sellers shall each be responsible for
50% of all filing fees and payments to any Governmental Entity in order to
obtain any consents, approvals or waivers pursuant to this _Section 5.2_.

 

5.3 _Further Assurances_. Sellers and Purchasers agree that, from time to
time, whether before, at or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute
and deliver such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such
other action as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, (A) effect the Reorganization as described in _Exhibit
G_ , including transferring all of the assets and liabilities of Daravita,
other than those listed on _Section 5.3_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, to
Newco, or as otherwise mutually and reasonably agreed upon by Sellers and
Purchasers, and (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, as of
the Closing, Newco and Alkermes Gainesville hold no other assets or
liabilities (including assets or liabilities relating to Excluded Assets)
other than those of the Business. Sellers shall make available to Purchasers
in a timely manner for review and comment all drafts of the agreements
relating to the Reorganization (collectively, the " _Reorganization Transfer
Agreements_ ") or other instruments or documentation relating to the
Reorganization, and Sellers shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
execute any such Reorganization Transfer Agreements or other instruments or
documentation, or to take any actions or consummate any steps or transactions
contemplated thereby, in each case, that is not reasonably satisfactory to
Purchasers.

(b) In connection with the Reorganization, APIL and Newco will enter into a
license agreement (the " _IP License Agreement_ "), in form reasonably
acceptable to the Parties, granting to Newco licenses in substantially similar
form and scope as those granted to Daravita pursuant to the Intellectual
Property Transfer and License Agreement. The Parties hereto agree to amend the
provisions regarding Earn-Out Consideration set forth on _Exhibit E_ hereto as
may be reasonably necessary in order to effect the intent of the Parties upon
entry into the IP License Agreement.

(c) After the consummation of the Reorganization, to the extent that Daravita
receives any payments for accounts receivable owned by Newco, Daravita will
transfer such payments to an account designated by Newco.

 

(d) After the Closing, Purchasers will, and will cause their Affiliates to,
upon the discovery of any Excluded Assets in the Transferred Entities
properties, offices, plants, storage spaces or similar locations, use
reasonable efforts to return such Excluded Assets to Sellers at Sellers
expense.

 



-46- 5.4 _Conduct of Business_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement (including transactions required by the Reorganization), as required
by Law, as disclosed in _Section 5.4_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, or
with Purchasers written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that Purchasers shall be deemed to have
consented in writing to any written request by Sellers to which Purchasers
fail to respond within five (5) Business Days following receipt), Sellers
shall cause each Transferred Entity to:

(i) conduct the Business in the ordinary course of business; and

 

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact their respective business
organizations and goodwill, keep available the services of their respective
present senior officers and key employees, and preserve the goodwill and

Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the Transferred
Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on a deemed
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
and the amount of other Taxes of the Transferred Entities for a
Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period.

7.4 _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(a) _Notices_. Purchasers shall promptly notify Sellers in writing upon
receipt by Purchasers, the Transferred Entities or any of their Affiliates of

copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the
Governmental Entity.

 

(b) _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. Sellers shall have the right, at their expense,
to control any Tax Proceeding in respect of the Transferred Entities for any

Tax Proceeding and shall permit Purchasers to participate in the Tax
Proceeding at its expense, through counsel or accountants reasonably
acceptable to Sellers, and Sellers shall not settle, compromise, or conclude
any such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the applicable
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned.
Purchasers, at Sellers expense, may control and contest any Tax Proceeding
which Sellers would otherwise have the right to control under this _Section
7.4(b)_ if Sellers (i) decline or fail to contest such Tax Proceeding or (ii)
do not substantially comply with

 



-57-  the provisions of the preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the applicable Purchaser exercises its right to control and contest any Tax
Proceeding under the preceding clause, such Purchaser shall (i) provide
Sellers with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such
Tax Proceeding, (ii) not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding
without obtaining the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iii) consult with Sellers
concerning the appropriate strategy for contesting such Tax Proceeding.

 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. Purchasers shall control, at their own expense, any
Tax Proceeding in respect of the Transferred Entities for any Straddle
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers shall provide Sellers with a
timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding.

 

7.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Purchasers, the Transferred Entities, and Sellers shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ and any Tax
Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Transferred Entities and Sellers agree
(A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Transferred Entities relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Purchasers or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other Party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the Transferred
Entities or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take
possession of such books and records.

 

(b) Purchasers and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

7.6 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
and in particular _Section 7.2(a)_ of this Agreement, all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes (including
any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the purchase of the
Transferred Interests shall be borne by the Party that bears
liability therefor under applicable Law.

7.7 _Survival_. The representations and warranties in _Section 3.12_ shall

(a) by mutual written consent of Sellers and Purchasers;

(b) by either Sellers or Purchasers, if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before May 8, 2015 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party
to this Agreement whose failure or whose Affiliates failure to perform any
material covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been the primary
cause of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
occur on or before such date;

 

(ii) if the other Party shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to
perform (A) would

 



-60-  give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or
_Section 8.2(b)_ (in the case of a breach by Sellers) or _Section 8.3(a)_
or  _Section 8.3(b)_ (in the case of a breach by Purchasers), and (B) cannot
be or has not been cured prior to the earlier of (1) the Business Day prior to
the Outside Date or (2) the date that is thirty (30) days from the date that
Purchasers or Sellers, as applicable, is notified by the other in writing of
such breach or failure to perform; or

 

(iii) if any Prohibitive Order permanently prevents, restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Sale, and such Prohibitive Order
becomes effective (and final and nonappealable);

(c) by Sellers if Closing has not occurred by the third (3rd) Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ excluding the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(e)_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or by
such other time and date as mutually agreed by the Parties pursuant to
_Section 2.3_, provided that such failure to close is not the result of any
action or inaction of Sellers; and

(d) by Purchasers if Closing has not occurred by the third (3rd) Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) or by such other time and date as mutually agreed by the Parties
pursuant to _Section 2.3_, provided that such failure to close is not
the result of any action or inaction of Purchasers.

9.2 _Notice of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Sellers and Purchasers pursuant to _Section 9.1_, written
notice of such termination shall be given by the terminating Party to the
other Parties to this Agreement.

 

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Sellers and Purchasers pursuant to  _Section 9.1_, this
Agreement shall terminate and become void and have no effect, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned without further
action by the Parties to this Agreement, except that the provisions of 
_Section 5.1(a)_, _Section 9.4_, _Section 11.2_ and _Section 11.5_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
termination shall not relieve any Party to this Agreement of liability for
any fraud or willful breach of this Agreement.

9.4 _Reverse Termination Fee._

 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Sellers pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 9.1(c)_, then Purchasers shall pay by wire transfer

the amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Reverse Termination
Fee_ "); _provided, however,_ that Purchasers shall not be liable to Sellers
for the Reverse Termination Fee solely due to a failure to satisfy the
conditions of _Section 8.2(e)_, provided that Purchasers have complied with
its obligations under _Section 5.12_.

 



-61- (b) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

due pursuant to this  _Section 9.4_, and, in order to obtain such payments,
Sellers commence a suit that results in a judgment against Purchasers for the
amounts set forth in this _Section 9.4_, Purchasers will pay to Sellers,
Sellers costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit. The Parties acknowledge that the
Reverse Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but rather is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Sellers in
the circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Sale, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 9.4(b)_, in any circumstance in which
Sellers have the right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 9.4(a)_, Sellers termination of this Agreement and receipt of the

their Affiliates against Purchasers, the financing sources of the Debt

future general or limited partners, managers, members, stockholders,
officers, directors, Affiliates, employees, representatives, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") for
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby,
or the Debt Financing Agreements, and upon such termination by Sellers and
receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee, none of the Purchasers, the financing
sources of the Debt Financing, or any of their respective Purchaser Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, or the Debt
Financing Agreements (except that the applicable Purchaser Related Parties of
the Purchasers (and not the Purchaser Related Parties of the financing sources
of the Debt Financing) shall remain obligated for, and Sellers and their
Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, any breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement or the provisions of _Section 11.3_, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise).

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

10.1 _Survival Periods_. All representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, and the right to commence any claim with respect thereto under

-62- 10.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_. Subject to the provisions of this _Article
X_ , from and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchasers and its Affiliates, each of their respective directors,

and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Purchasers
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses to the extent
resulting from or arising out of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in
_Article III_ of this Agreement as of the Closing Date (or with respect to
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date, as of such
date);

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
performed by Sellers after the Closing; and

(c) the Initial Retention Bonuses.

 

10.3 _Indemnification by Purchasers_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Article X_ , from and after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall indemnify and
hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates, each of their respective

successors and assigns of any of the foregoing from and against any and all
Losses resulting from or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchasers contained in
_Article IV_ of this Agreement as of the Closing Date (or with respect to

date);

 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
performed by Purchasers after the Closing; and

 

(c) actions taken on behalf of, or at the request of, Purchasers in connection
with the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing.

 

10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ "), shall promptly notify the Party or Parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
pending or threatened claim or demand other than a Tax Proceeding that the
Indemnified Party has determined gives or would reasonably be expected to
give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a
pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the
Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim or demand (including copies of any summons, complaint or
other pleading which may have been served on it and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations 

 



-63-  under this _Article X_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that notices for claims
in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period
specified in _Section 10.1_ for such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or  _Section 10.3_, other than
a Tax Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of
notice of such Third Party Claim, to undertake, conduct and control the
settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such
Indemnifying Party); _provided that_ the Indemnifying Party shall only be
entitled to undertake, conduct and control such settlement or defense if it
acknowledges, in writing, to the Indemnified Party, its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms and subject to the
limitations of this _Article X_. The Indemnifying Party shall allow the
Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of any Third Party
Claim pursuant to this  _Section 10.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to assume and control such defense through counsel of its own choice,
and the reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with such defense
shall be considered Losses hereunder with respect to the subject matter of
such claim, indemnifiable to the extent provided in this _Article X_ , but the
Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
settlement or defense of a Third Party Claim under this _Section 10.4(b)_
unless: (A) the Third Party Claim involves solely monetary damages, (B) the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates to the Indemnified Partys reasonable
satisfaction that the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources in
order to indemnify for the full amount of such potential Losses for which the
Indemnifying Party is reasonably likely to be liable pursuant to this _Article
X_ , and (C) the amount of such potential Losses for which the Indemnifying
Party is reasonably likely to be liable does not exceed the Cap. If either
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party assumes the defense and
control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party, as applicable, shall select counsel and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim.
Purchasers or Sellers, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of
their Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, as applicable, in the defense of any
Third Party Claim, including by furnishing Books and Records, personnel and
witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third
Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of the Indemnified Party; provided that
such settlement or judgment shall consist solely of a recovery of monetary
damages for which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant to this
_Article X_ , and the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all
amounts in such settlement or judgment (other than solely with respect to the
Deductible would be applicable in accordance with the applicable provisions of
_Section 10.5_) and (ii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other
resolution, a complete and unconditional release of any Indemnified Party
affected by such Third Party Claim. Except as set forth in the previous
sentence, no Party shall settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld,

 



-64-  conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that is shall not be unreasonable for
an Indemnified Party to withhold its consent to any settlement that involves
any injunctive relief binding on any of the Indemnified Parties or a finding
or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any
Indemnified Party. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 10.4_ shall be subject to the
provisions of any Contract providing for the defense or prosecution of
any Action.

10.5 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Sellers shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)_ with respect to Losses for which indemnification is provided
thereunder, (i) to the extent such Losses were included in the calculation of
Working Capital on the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, as finally
determined pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ through _2.7_ , (ii) to the extent that
Purchasers received a benefit from the reflection of such matter in the
calculation of the adjustment of the Initial Purchase Price, if any, as
finally determined pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ through _2.7_ , (iii) that are
De Minimis Damages or (iv) unless the aggregate of all Losses (other than De
Minimis Damages) exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "
_Deductible_ ") in which case Sellers shall be liable for all such Losses
(other than De Minimis Damages) in excess of the amount of the Deductible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall have no liability for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ with respect to Losses of any
aggregate amount that exceeds the Cap, it being understood that in the event
any Purchasers Indemnified Party seeks indemnification for Losses in excess of
the Cap and the Cap subsequently increases to a greater value as a result of
the payment of Development Milestone Earn-Out Consideration and/or Commercial
Milestone Earn-Out Consideration to APIL, such Purchasers Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to seek indemnification in accordance with such increased
Cap and the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any Losses arising out of or
resulting from (1) the breach of any Fundamental Representation, (2) the
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 3.12_ (Taxes);
(3) the breach of any Purchasers Fundamental Representation; (4) the breach of
any covenant set forth in this Agreement; or (5) fraud.

(c) Purchasers shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.3(a)_ with respect to Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder, (i) that are De Minimis Damages or (ii) unless the
aggregate of all Losses (other than De Minimis Damages) exceeds the
Deductible, in which case Purchasers shall be liable for all such Losses
(other than De Minimis Damages) in excess of the amount of the Deductible.

(d) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses arising out of or
resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty of set forth in
this Agreement, any reference to "Material Adverse Effect" or "materiality" or
other correlative terms in such representations or warranties shall be
disregarded.

 



-65- (e) Sellers shall not be liable under this Article X for any Losses based upon
or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations
or warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement if Purchasers had
knowledge, based solely upon written documentation included in the data room,
of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the Closing. For purposes of this
Section 10.5(e), Purchasers shall be deemed to have knowledge of all written
documentation included in the data room as of the date hereof and included on
the disk delivered pursuant to _Section 5.21_. 

10.6 _Mitigation; Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that an
Indemnified Party asserts under this _Article X_ (including by taking
reasonable best efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and
indemnity provisions covering any Losses for which it is seeking
indemnification hereunder, to the same extent as it would if such Loss were
not subject to indemnification hereunder).

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, Losses shall be calculated after giving
effect to amounts actually received under any insurance policy, (net of any
costs to recover such amounts and increases in premiums resulting from such
claim).

 

(c) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided shall be
adjusted to take into account the amount of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of the incurrence or payment of
any such Losses in the form of a refund or reduction in Taxes otherwise
payable within the tax year in which the Losses were incurred or paid, or the
next two immediately succeeding tax years, in each case, calculated by
comparing Taxes that would have been payable without taking into account any
deduction or credit resulting from such Losses and Taxes actually payable by
taking into account such deductions or credits (but only after all other
items of income, gain, loss and deduction have been taken into account). If
the Indemnified Party actually realizes a Tax benefit after an indemnification
payment is made to it that was not taken into account at the time the
indemnification payment was made, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount that the indemnification payment would have been
reduced by if such Tax benefit had been actually realized prior to the time
such indemnification payment was made.

(d) No Indemnified Party will, in any event, be entitled to any incidental,
indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages, including
actual or potential lost profits, diminution in value or measures of damages
based on a multiple.

 

10.7 _Liquidated Damages_. In the event of the occurrence of an event
described on _Section 10.7_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter (a "
_Liquidated Damages Event_ "), monetary damages would be difficult, if not
impossible, to measure. The Parties therefore agree that liquidated damages
shall be payable by Sellers to Purchasers in the manner and amount described
on _Schedule 10.7_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter. Such payments shall begin
to be made to Purchasers within sixty (60) days of receipt by Sellers from
Purchasers of written notice of the existence of a Liquidated Damages Event,
and thereafter shall be made within thirty (30) days of the end of any month
in which a Liquidated Damages Event exists. The Parties

 



-66-  acknowledge and agree that this liquidated damages provision is reasonable
and does not constitute a penalty. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement, the Parties further agree that this is the sole and exclusive
remedy for any Losses arising from or in connection with the events or
circumstances set forth on _Section 10.7_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter.

 

10.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except with respect to the matters covered by
_Section 2.5_, _Section 2.6_,  _Section 5.14_, _Section 10.7_, _Section
11.10_, and, with respect to indemnification for Tax matters, _Article VII_ ,
Sellers and Purchasers acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of _Section 10.2_ and _Section 10.3_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies of Sellers and Purchasers, respectively, for
any Losses (whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability,
Environmental Law (including CERCLA or any similar state law) or otherwise)
that each Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a
result of, or in connection with, any breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement by the other Parties or any failure by the other Parties to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, by such other Parties prior to the
Closing.

 

10.9 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
Agreement) in connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than the
Parties hereto or their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to
any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party may

11.7 _Assignment_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party to this Agreement will assign its
rights or delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without
the express prior written consent of each other Party to this Agreement,
except that either Party may assign its benefits under this Agreement to an
Affiliate of that Party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
_Section 11.7_ shall be void.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 11.7(a)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, APIL may assign its rights to any third party to
(a) receive the Net Sales Earn-Out Consideration, (b) receive the Net Sales
Report, (c) audit the records of Purchasers,

 



-71-  their Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees as described in _Section 3.3_
of _Exhibit E_ , and (d) make indemnification claims against Purchasers, in
connection with any securitization or monetization of the Net Sales Earn-Out
Consideration (a " _Securitization_ "), and APIL may disclose Business
Confidential Information to a third party in connection with a Securitization
to the extent reasonably necessary to enable the third party to evaluate the
Securitization opportunity and to allow APIL to exercise its rights under this
_Section 11.7(b)_.

 

11.8 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their successors and
assigns) any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , that the rights of the
financing sources of the Debt Financing provided in this _Section 11.8_ and
_Section 9.4(c)_, _Section 11.9_ and  _Section 11.14_ shall be enforceable
by the financing sources of the Debt Financing, their Affiliates and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party against
whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought. Each Party
to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by
the other Parties to this Agreement with any term or provision of
this Agreement on the part of such other Parties to this Agreement to be
performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party to this Agreement of a
breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment
or waiver of this sentence of _Section 11.9_ or _Section 9.4(c)_, _Section
11.8_ or _Section 11.14_ shall require the prior written consent of
Orbimed Royalty Opportunities II, LP, but only to the extent that such
Sections relate to the financing sources of the Debt Financing, their
Affiliates or their respective successors or assigns.

 

11.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any provision of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches by the Parties of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any of the other Parties has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any Party against whom an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement is sought hereby waives any requirement for the
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such order or injunction. The foregoing is in
addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at law, in equity
or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set forth in this
_Section 11.10_ shall require any Party hereto to institute any Action for
(or limit any Partys right to institute any Action for) specific performance
under this  _Section 11.10_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article IX_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination). The Parties

 



-72-  hereto agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers
shall be entitled to specific performance (or any other equitable relief) to
cause Purchasers to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including to draw down the Debt Financing under the Debt Financing Agreements
(including any bridge financing or "flex" provisions thereunder) or
Alternative Financing commitments obtained under  _Section 5.12_, and to
effect the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement, if, and only if: (i) all conditions in _Section 8.1_, _Section
8.2_ and _Section 8.3_ have been satisfied as of the date on which the
Closing would otherwise be required to occur (other than those conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such
conditions would reasonably be expected to have been satisfied as of such
date)), (ii) Purchasers fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing
would otherwise be required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3_, (iii)
the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing in accordance with _Section
5.12_) has been funded or will be available to be funded to Purchasers at the
Closing, and (iv) the Closing would reasonably be expected to occur
substantially simultaneously with the draw down of Debt Financing (or
Alternative Financing in accordance with _Section 5.12_)).

11.11 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_. 

(a) It is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in the Sellers Disclosure Letter is not
intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or such items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of any amount or the fact of the inclusion of any
item in the Sellers Disclosure Letter in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this
Agreement or included in the Sellers Disclosure Letter is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the singular shall be
held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be
held to include the other gender as the context requires; (ii) references to
the terms Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule are references to
the Articles, Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified; (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereto," and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement,
including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto; (iv) references to "$" or cash
shall mean U.S. dollars; (v) the word "including" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement shall mean "including without limitation," unless
otherwise specified; (vi) the word "or" shall not be exclusive; (vii)
references to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic form; (viii)
provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to successive events and
transactions; (ix) Sellers and Purchasers have each participated in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and if an ambiguity or question
of interpretation should arise, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or burdening any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
of the provisions in this Agreement; (x) a reference to any Person includes
such Persons successors and permitted assigns; (xi) any reference to "days"
shall mean calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and
(xii) when calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period shall end at the close of business on the next succeeding Business
Day.

(c) If the Closing shall occur, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any payment obligation of Purchasers hereunder shall be a joint
and several obligation of Purchasers and the Transferred Entities.

 



-73- 11.12 _Headings; Definitions_. The Section and Article headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

11.13  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement (or portions thereof) shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party hereto. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof)
shall be held to be so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. Upon a determination that
any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is invalid,
void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

11.14 _No Recourse to Debt Financing Sources_. Subject to the rights of the
parties to the Debt Financing Agreements under the terms thereof, none of the
Parties hereto, nor any of their respective, direct or indirect, former,
current or future general or limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, officers, directors, Affiliates, employees, representatives,
agents, successors or assigns (collectively, the " _Related Persons_ "),
shall have any rights or claims against the financing sources of the Debt
Financing or any of their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, nor shall any of the
financing sources of the Debt Financing or any of their Affiliates have any
obligations or liabilities to the Parties hereto or their respective Related
Persons, all of which are hereby waived (provided that nothing in this
_Section 11.14_ shall in any way limit or modify any of the obligations owed
under the Debt Financing Agreements by the financing sources of the Debt
Financing to the Purchasers and their Affiliates), and the financing sources
of the Debt Financing and their Affiliates and their respective Related
Persons shall not have any rights or claims against any Party hereto or
any Related Person thereof, in connection with this Agreement or the Debt
Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise

Products. No fines, penalties or comparable payments to national, federal,
state, or local governments (or their agencies) or to other third parties
shall be deductible from Net Sales.

purposes; (2) for preclinical, clinical trial, or non-commercial manufacturing
purposes; or (3) for regulatory or governmental purposes shall not in each

Products in line with normal industry practice shall not be deemed "sales" for
the purposes of calculating Net Sales. Otherwise, for the purposes of
calculating Net Sales, a "sale" shall include any transfer or other
disposition of any Earn-Out Product for consideration. With respect to sales of Earn-Out Products invoiced in U.S. dollars, Net Sales
shall be determined in U.S. dollars. With respect to sales of Earn-Out
Products invoiced in a currency other than U.S. dollars, Net Sales shall be
determined by converting the currencies in which the sales are made into U.S.
dollars, at rates of exchange determined in a manner consistent with
Purchasers, its Affiliates, its licensees or its sublicensees, as
applicable, method for calculating rates of exchange in the preparation of

Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, shall file an NDA for an Earn-Out
Product with the FDA on or before [***] (the " _NDA Requirement_ ").

 

3.2 _Reporting_.

(a) For so long as any Earn-Out Product is in development, on each
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide a written report to
APIL detailing the development activities with respect to the Earn-Out
Products completed for the past annual reporting period and anticipated to be
undertaken for the next twelve (12) months period. At a minimum, such report
shall include a list and general status (i.e., what stage in
discovery/development using Purchasers internal measures) of each Earn-Out
Product then in development, and any ongoing pre-clinical or clinical
activities (including initiations and cessations) and results, and submission
and approvals to or from Regulatory Authorities (including anticipated date
of achievement of the Development Milestones), and any other similar
information relating to development activities for the Earn-Out Products.
Purchaser shall cause its senior officers from its research and clinical
development operations to be reasonably available to APIL to answer questions
related to the matters required to be discussed in each report.

(b) For so long as any Earn-Out Product is being marketed, sold, or otherwise

records in sufficient detail to permit APIL, at its expense, to confirm the
achievement of Development Milestones and Commercial Milestones, and the
calculation of Earn-Out Consideration payable under this Agreement and this 
_Exhibit E_. Upon reasonable prior notice,

 



[***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment
has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.  such books and records shall be open during regular business hours for a
period of three (3) years from the creation of individual books and records
for examination, by an independent certified public accountant selected by
APIL and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser for the sole purpose of verifying
for APIL the accuracy of the financial statements, reports and notices
furnished by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and this  _Exhibit E_, and
of any payments made, or required to be made, by Purchaser to APIL pursuant to
this Agreement and this _Exhibit E_. Any amounts shown to be owed to APIL but
unpaid shall be paid by Purchaser within thirty (30) days after the
accountants report, plus interest (as set forth in Section 2.3 of this
_Exhibit E_) from the original due date. If Purchaser is found to have

shall also pay for the conduct of the audit. In the event that Purchaser has
overpaid APIL, at APILs option, Purchaser shall either credit the amount of
any such overpayment to amounts subsequently due by Purchaser to APIL under
this _Exhibit E_ or APIL shall reimburse Purchaser the amount of any such
overpayment.



     | ARTICLE 4 | _Reversion._ 
---|---|--- 

4.1 _Determination of Reversion Event_.

 

(a) A " _Reversion Event_ " shall exist in the event that Purchaser, itself or
through one or more of its Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, (i) fails
to satisfy the NDA Requirement, or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of APIL,
fails to comply with its Commercially Reasonable Efforts requirements under
Section 3.1 of this _Exhibit E_; _provided that_ , any such failure is not
attributable to the material breach by APIL or any of its Affiliates of any of
the Ancillary Agreements, which material breach was noticed by Purchaser prior
to its receipt of a Reversion Notice from APIL under this Section 4.1.

(A) In the event the failure to satisfy the NDA Requirement is the result of a
change in the FDAs policies or procedures regarding the approval of the
Earn-Out Product or drugs in the same class as the Earn-Out Product, and
Purchaser, its Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees have used Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to accommodate such change and were still unable to
satisfy the NDA Requirement, then the deadline shall be extended for a
reasonable period of time, but not more than three-hundred sixty-five (365)
calendar days or such longer period of time as determined by APIL in good
faith based on the impact of such change in the FDAs policies or procedures
on their ability to accommodate such change in policies or procedures. (B) In
the event the failure to satisfy the NDA Requirement is the result of other
delays or circumstances that are outside of the reasonable control of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, and Purchaser, its
Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees have used Commercially Reasonable
Efforts consistent with Section 3.1 of this _Exhibit E_ to overcome such
delay or circumstance, then APIL will reasonably consider extending the
deadline for a reasonable period of time, but not more than three-hundred
sixty-five (365) days, to overcome such failure. In each case of (A) or (B),
the compliance with such new deadline shall remain an obligation of Purchaser,
its Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees subject to their diligence efforts
under Section 3.1 of this _Exhibit E_ and APILs rights under this Section
4.1(a).

(b) Upon a Reversion Event, APIL shall provide Purchaser with written notice
of such Reversion Event (a " _Reversion Notice_ "). If Purchaser disagrees
with APIL regarding the existence of a Reversion Event, it shall notify APIL
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a Reversion Notice of its
disagreement (such period, the " _Challenge Period_ ," and such notice, a "
_Disagreement Notice_ "). For a period of thirty (30) Business Days following
the delivery of such Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and APIL shall seek in
good faith to come to an agreement on the existence of the Reversion Event.
If at the end of such thirty (30) Business Day period the Purchaser and APIL
have not reached an agreement, they shall jointly select an independent
mediator, free of any conflict with either Party, having the requisite
licensing and pharmaceutical industry experience to render a decision
regarding the existence of a Reversion Event, and selected from a panel of
persons experienced in the pharmaceutical and life sciences   industries provided by Judicial Administration and Arbitration Services or
its successor (" _JAMS_ "). If the Parties do not agree on an independent
mediator within five (5) Business Days of initiating mediation under this
_Section 4.1(b)_, the independent mediator shall be selected by JAMS in
accordance with its rules. Each Party shall prepare and submit a written
summary of such Partys position, which shall not exceed twenty-five (25)
pages, and any relevant evidence in support thereof to the independent
mediator within ten (10) Business Days of the selection of the independent
mediator. Upon receipt of such summaries from both Parties, the independent
mediator shall provide copies of the same to the other Party. The independent
mediator shall be authorized to solicit briefing or other submissions on
particular questions and to set specific page limits for such additional
briefing and submissions. Within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of
such summaries by the independent mediator, each Party shall submit a written
rebuttal of the other Partys summary and may also amend and re-submit
its original summary, with each Partys response to include a supporting
explanation of why its proposed terms are more appropriate than the other
Partys proposed terms and any documentary evidence in support thereof. Oral
presentations shall not be permitted unless otherwise requested by the
independent mediator. Only if so permitted, a neutral location of any such
oral presentations shall be selected by the independent mediator. The
independent mediator shall make a final decision with respect to the
arbitration matter within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of the last
of such rebuttal statements submitted by the Parties, and shall make a
determination by selecting the resolution proposed by one of the Parties
that as a whole is the most fair and reasonable to the Parties in light of
the totality of the circumstances, and shall provide the Parties with a
written statement setting forth the basis of the determination in connection
therewith. For clarity, the independent mediator shall only have the right to
select a resolution proposed by one of the Parties in its entirety and without
modification. The decision of the independent mediator shall be controlling
regarding the existence of a Reversion Event. The Purchaser and APIL shall
bear the costs of the independent mediator equally.

(c) If the existence of a Reversion Event, other than one that involves a
failure to satisfy the NDA Requirement, is confirmed, through (i) Purchasers
non-delivery of a Notice of Disagreement or (ii) through the determination of
an independent mediator, Purchaser, itself or through one or more of its
Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees shall have the right to cure such
Reversion Event for a period of four (4) months from the determination of such
Reversion Event (such period, the " _Cure Period_ ") and, if it elects to
exercise such right, shall notify APIL in writing of the same. In the case
that such Reversion Event is cured in APILs reasonable judgment during or by
the end of the Cure Period, such Reversion Event shall no longer exist
and APIL shall not have the right to invoke any other rights under this
_Article 4_ in connection with such event that would have remained a Reversion
Event but for such cure.

 

(d) For purposes of this _Article 4_ , the " _Reversion Date_ " shall be (i)
the date on which the Challenge Period expires without Purchaser having sent
a Disagreement Notice to APIL, unless the Reversion Event at issue qualifies
for a right to cure pursuant to Section 4.1(c) of this _Exhibit E_ and
Purchaser has elected to exercise such right to cure in which case clause
(d)(iii) below shall apply, (ii) where the Reversion Event involves a failure
to satisfy the NDA Requirement and Purchaser has sent a Disagreement Notice in
connection therewith, the date on which the Parties agree, or the independent
mediator issues its determination, that such Reversion Event has occurred, or
(iii) where the Reversion Event does not involve a failure to satisfy the NDA
Requirement, and Purchaser has elected its right to cure pursuant to Section
4.1(c) of this _Exhibit E_ , the date on which the Cure Period expires without
Purchaser having cured such Reversion Event to APILs reasonable satisfaction.

 

4.2 _Events Upon Determination of a Reversion Event._

 

(a) On the Reversion Date, all licenses and other rights of Purchaser and its
Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees under the Intellectual Property

and anticipated amounts of such payments and APIL shall have the right either
to decline such (sub)license, right of reference or other right provided in

with any obligations under such agreement of Purchaser that apply to APIL and
of which APIL was informed by Purchaser and to make such payments.

 

(h) Promptly following the Reversion Date and as requested by APIL, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees to, (i)
wind up the performance of any clinical trials for Earn-Out Products ongoing
as of the Reversion Date, or (ii) transfer and assign to APIL, to the extent
assignable by Purchaser in accordance with applicable Law, the management and
continued performance of any clinical trials for Earn-Out Products ongoing as
of the Reversion Date (provided that if the management and continued
performance thereof is not assignable, then at the request of APIL, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, licensees and sublicensees to,
continue to manage and perform such clinical trial(s) for a limited time
period at the direction of APIL) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
cost of which that is incurred after the Reversion Date shall be borne by
APIL.

(i) Promptly following the Reversion Date and as requested by APIL, Purchaser
shall assign to APIL any agreements with third party suppliers covering the

such Earn-Out Product calculated in accordance with industry standards
(including overhead) plus [***].

 

(j) As of the Reversion Date, if Purchaser or any of its and its Affiliates,
licensees or sublicensees have any inventory of Earn-Out Product, or any
components thereof, suitable for use in clinical trials or for
commercialization (" _Reversion Material_ "), Purchaser and its Affiliates,
licensees and sublicensees shall offer in writing to sell the Reversion
Material to APIL at Purchasers or the applicable Affiliates, licensees or
sublicensees fully-allocated cost of manufacturing, and APIL shall have the
option (but no obligation) to purchase the same by responding in writing to
such offer within thirty (30) days. If APIL does not exercise such option,
Purchaser and its Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees shall be entitled to
sell any such Reversion Material, subject to any Earn-Out Consideration
applicable to such sale pursuant to the terms and conditions of this _Exhibit
E_.

set forth in this Article 4.

4.6 Purchaser shall not, and shall ensure that its Affiliates shall not,
grant any Lien in or to any Assigned Reversion IP Assets, or take any action
or commit any omission that may adversely affect or in any way impair,
interfere with or prevent APILs right to receive the benefit of the
assignments, transfers and licenses granted under this Article 4.

THIS WARRANT CERTIFIES THAT, for good and valuable consideration, Alkermes
Pharma Ireland Limited, a private limited company incorporated in Ireland
(together with any successor or permitted assignee or transferee of this
Warrant, "Holder") is entitled to purchase the number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares (the "Shares") of the above-stated Class of Stock (the
"Class") of the above-named company (the "Company") at the above-stated
Warrant Price per Share, all as set forth above and as adjusted pursuant to 
_Article 2_ of this Warrant, subject to the provisions and upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Warrant.

ARTICLE 1 

EXERCISE

1.1  _Method of Exercise_. Holder may exercise this Warrant, in whole or in
part, at any time or from time to time on any day on or prior to the
Expiration Date, by delivering the original of this Warrant together with a
duly executed Notice of Exercise in substantially the form attached as
_Appendix 1_ to the principal office of the Company. Unless Holder is
exercising the net exercise right set forth in _Article 1.2_ , Holder shall
also deliver to the Company a check, wire transfer (to an account designated
by the Company), or other form of payment acceptable to the Company for the
aggregate Warrant Price for the Shares being purchased.

 

1.2 _Net Exercise_. In lieu of exercising this Warrant as specified in
_Article 1.1_ , Holder may from time to time convert this Warrant, in whole
or in part, into a number of Shares determined by dividing (a) the aggregate
fair market value of the Shares or other securities otherwise issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant minus the aggregate Warrant Price of such Shares by
(b) the fair market value of one Share. The fair market value of the Shares
shall be determined pursuant to _Article 1.3_. The Company acknowledges that
the provisions of this

 



   1  | NTD: to equal two times the closing price of Recro stock on the
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. 
---|--- 
   2  |

NTD: to insert Closing Date. 
   _Article 1.2_ are intended, in part, to ensure that a full or partial
exchange of this Warrant pursuant to this _Article 1.2_ will qualify as a
conversion, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act. At the request of Holder, the Company will accept reasonable
modifications to the exchange procedures provided for in this Article in order
to accomplish such intent. For all purposes of this Warrant (other than this
_Article 1.2_ ), any reference herein to the exercise of this Warrant shall be
deemed to include a reference to the exchange of this Warrant into Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article 1.2_.

 

1.3 _Fair Market Value_. If the Companys common stock is traded in a public
market, the fair market value of a Share shall be the closing price of a
share of common stock reported for the business day immediately before Holder
delivers this Warrant together with its Notice of Exercise to the Company. If
the Companys common stock is not traded in a public market, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall determine fair market value of a Share (the
"Appraised Value") in its reasonable good faith judgment. If Holder (as
defined below) shall, for any reason whatsoever, disagree with such Appraised
Value, then such Holder shall, by giving written notice to the Company (an
"Appraisal Notice") within ten (10) days after the Company notifies the Holder
of such determination, elect to dispute such determination, and such dispute
shall be resolved as set forth in _Article 1.3.1_ below.

1.3.1 _Appraisal Resolution_. The Company shall within ten (10) days after an
Appraisal Notice shall have been given, engage an independent investment bank
of national repute (the "Appraiser") that is mutually agreeable to the Company
and Holder and retained pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company
and the Appraiser with respect to such valuation in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Holder, to make an independent determination of the
Appraised Value of a Share. The costs of engagement of such investment bank
for any such determination of Appraised Value shall be shared equally between
the Company and Holder and Holder shall promptly reimburse the Company for
fifty percent (50%) of such costs.

 

1.4 _Delivery of Certificate and New Warrant_. Promptly after Holder exercises
or converts this Warrant and, if applicable, the Company receives payment of
the aggregate Warrant Price, the Company shall deliver to Holder certificates
for the Shares acquired and, if this Warrant has not been fully exercised or
converted and has not expired, a new warrant of like tenor representing the
Shares not so acquired.

1.5 _Replacement of Warrants_. On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant
and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an indemnity
agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company or, in the
case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the
Company shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this Warrant, a new warrant of
like tenor.

 



2 1.6 _Treatment of Warrant upon Corporate Reorganization_.

 

1.6.1 _Corporate Reorganization_.

 

(a) Without limiting any of the provisions hereof, if any: (i) capital
reorganization; (ii) reclassification of the capital stock of the Company;
(iii) merger, consolidation or reorganization or other similar transaction or
series of related transactions which results in the voting securities of the
Company outstanding immediately prior thereto representing
immediately thereafter (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted
into voting securities of the surviving or acquiring entity) less than 50% of
the combined voting power of the voting securities of or economic interests in
the Company or such surviving or acquiring entity outstanding immediately
after such merger, consolidation or reorganization; (iv) sale, lease, license,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company; (v) sale of shares of capital stock of the Company, in
a single transaction or series of related transactions, representing at least
50% of the voting power of the voting securities of or economic interests in
the Company; or (vi) the acquisition by any "person" (together with his, her
or its Affiliates) or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act")) directly or indirectly, of the beneficial ownership (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of outstanding
shares of capital stock and/or other equity securities of the Company, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, one or more tender offers or exchange offers), representing at
least 50% of the voting power of or economic interests in the then outstanding
shares of capital stock of the corporation (each of (i)-(vi) above a
"Corporate Reorganization") shall be effected, then the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that lawful and adequate
provision shall be made whereby each Holder shall thereafter continue to have
the right to purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and
conditions herein specified and in lieu of the Shares issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants held by such Holder, shares of stock in the surviving or
acquiring entity ("Acquirer"), as the case may be, such that the aggregate
value of the Holders warrants to purchase such number of shares, where the
value of each new warrant to purchase one share in the Acquirer is determined
in accordance with the Black-Scholes Option Pricing formula set forth in
_Appendix 2_ hereto, is at least equivalent to the aggregate value of the
Warrants held by such Holder immediately prior to such Corporate
Reorganization, where the value of each Warrant to purchase one share in the
Company is determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes Option Pricing
formula set forth _Appendix 3_ hereto. Furthermore, the new warrants to
purchase shares in the Acquirer referred to herein shall have the same
expiration date as the Warrant, and shall have a strike price, KAcq, that is
calculated in accordance with _Appendix 2_ hereto. For the avoidance of doubt,
if the surviving or acquiring entity, as the case may be, is a member of a
consolidated group for financial reporting purposes, the "Acquirer" shall be
deemed to be the parent of such consolidated group for purposes of this
_Article 1.6_ and  _Appendix 2_ hereto.

(b) Appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and
interests of each Holder to the end that the provisions hereof (including,
without limitation, provision for adjustment of the Warrant Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly equivalent as may be practicable in
relation to any shares of stock thereafter deliverable upon the exercise
thereof. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
ensure that prior to

 



3  or simultaneously with the consummation of a Corporate Reorganization, the
successor corporation resulting from such consolidation or merger, or the
corporation purchasing or otherwise acquiring such assets or other
appropriate corporation or entity shall assume by written instrument,
reasonably deemed by the Board of Directors of the Company and Holder to be
satisfactory in form and substance, the obligation to deliver to the holder of
the Warrants, at the last address of such holder appearing on the books of
the Company, such shares of stock, as, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, such holder may be entitled to purchase, and the other obligations
under these Warrants. The provisions of this _Article 1.6_ shall similarly
apply to successive Corporate Reorganizations. If the Company, in spite of
using its commercially reasonable best efforts, is unable to cause these
Warrants to continue in full force and effect until the Expiration Date in
connection with any Corporate Reorganization, then the Company shall pay or
cause to be paid to Holder, prior to or contemporaneously with the
consummation of any such Corporate Reorganization, an amount per Warrant
to purchase one share in the Company that is calculated in accordance with
the Black-Scholes Option Pricing formula set forth in _Appendix 3_ hereto.
Such payment shall be made in cash in the event that the Corporate
Reorganization results in the shareholders of the Company receiving cash from
the Acquirer at the closing of the transaction, and shall be made in shares of
the Company (with the value of each share in the Company is determined
according to SCorp _Appendix 3_ hereto) in the event that the Corporate
Reorganization results in the shareholders of the Company receiving shares in
the Acquirer or other entity at the closing of the transaction, in the event
that the shareholders of the Company receive both cash and shares at the
closing of the transaction, such payment to Holder shall be also be made in
both cash and shares in the same proportion as the consideration received by
the shareholders.

ARTICLE 2

 

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SHARES

 

2.1 _Stock Dividends, Splits, Etc_. If the Company declares or pays a dividend
on the outstanding shares of the Class payable in common stock or other
securities, then upon exercise of this Warrant, for each Share acquired,
Holder shall receive, without cost to Holder, the total number and kind of
securities to which Holder would have been entitled had Holder owned the
Shares of record as of the date the dividend occurred. If the Company
subdivides the outstanding shares of the Class by reclassification or
otherwise into a greater number of shares, the number of Shares purchasable
hereunder shall be proportionately increased and the Warrant Price shall be
proportionately decreased. If the outstanding shares of the Class are combined
or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of
shares, the Warrant Price shall be proportionately increased and the number
of Shares shall be proportionately decreased. The Company or its successor
shall promptly issue to the Holder a certificate pursuant to _Article 2.6_
below setting forth the number and kind of such new securities or other
property issuable upon exercise or conversion of this Warrant as a result of
such stock dividend, subdivision, combination or consolidation by
reclassification or otherwise or other event that results in a change to the
number and/or class of securities issuable upon exercise or conversion of
this Warrant. The provisions of this _Article 2.1_ shall similarly apply to
successive stock dividends, subdivisions, combinations, consolidations or
other events.

 



4 2.2 _Reclassification, Exchange, Combinations or Substitution_. Upon any
reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event that results in a
change of the number and/or class of the securities issuable upon exercise or
conversion of this Warrant, Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise
or conversion of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities and property
that Holder would have received for the Shares if this Warrant had been
exercised immediately before such reclassification, exchange, substitution, or
other event. Such an event shall include, without limitation, any automatic
conversion of the outstanding or issuable securities of the Company of the
same class or series as the Shares to common stock pursuant to the terms of
the Companys Articles of Incorporation. The Company or its successor shall
promptly issue to Holder a certificate pursuant to _Article 2.6_ below setting
forth the number and kind of such new securities or other property issuable
upon exercise or conversion of this Warrant as a result of
such reclassification, exchange, substitution or other event that results in
a change of the number and/or class of securities issuable upon exercise or
conversion of this Warrant. The provisions of this _Article 2.2_ shall
similarly apply to successive reclassifications, exchanges, substitutions, or
other events.

2.3 _No Impairment_. The Company shall not, by amendment of its Articles of
Incorporation or bylaws or through a reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue, or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any
of the terms to be observed or performed under this Warrant by the Company,
but shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out of all the
provisions of this _Article 2_ and in taking such action as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to protect Holders rights under this Article
against impairment.

2.4 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Shares shall be issuable upon exercise
or conversion of the Warrant and the number of Shares to be issued shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole Share. If a fractional share interest arises
upon any exercise or conversion of the Warrant, the Company shall eliminate
such fractional share interest by paying Holder the amount computed by
multiplying the fractional interest by the fair market value of a full Share.

 

2.5 _Certificate as to Adjustments_. Upon each adjustment of the Warrant
Price, Class and/or number of Shares, the Company shall promptly notify
Holder in writing, and, at the Companys expense, promptly compute such
adjustment, and furnish Holder with a certificate of its Chief Financial
Officer setting forth such adjustment and the facts upon which such adjustment
is based. The Company shall, upon written request, furnish Holder a
certificate setting forth the Warrant Price, Class and number of Shares in
effect upon the date thereof and the series of adjustments leading to such
Warrant Price, Class and number of Shares. 

2.6 _Proceedings Prior to Any Action Requiring Adjustment_. As a condition
precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment
pursuant to this _Article 2_, the Company shall take any action which may be
necessary, including obtaining regulatory approvals or exemptions, in order
that the Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and
nonassessable all Shares which the Holder is entitled to receive upon exercise
of the Warrant.

and agrees with, the Holder as follows:

 

3.1.1 This Warrant has been duly authorized, is validly issued and constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of the Company.

 

3.1.2 All Shares which may be issued from time to time upon the exercise of
any of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant, and all securities,
if any, issuable upon conversion of the Shares, shall, upon issuance, be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and free of any
liens and encumbrances except for restrictions on transfer provided for herein
or under applicable federal and state securities laws.

3.2 _Notice of Certain Events_. If the Company proposes at any time (a)
to declare any dividend or distribution upon the outstanding shares of the
Class, whether in cash, property, stock, or other securities and whether or
not a regular cash dividend; (b) to offer for subscription or sale pro rata to
the holders of the outstanding shares of the Class any additional shares of
any class or series of the Companys stock (other than pursuant to contractual
pre-emptive rights); (c) to effect any reclassification, reorganization or
recapitalization of the shares of the Class; or (d) to effect an Acquisition
or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, then, in connection with each such
event, the Company shall give Holder: (1) at least 10 days prior written
notice of the date on which a record will be taken for such dividend,
distribution, or subscription rights (and specifying the date on which the
holders of shares of the Class will be entitled thereto) or for determining
rights to vote, if any, in respect of the matters referred to in (c) and (d)
above; and (2) in the case of the matters referred to in (c) and (d) above at
least 10 days prior written notice of the date when the same will take place
(and specifying the date on which the holders of shares of the Class will be
entitled to exchange their shares for the securities or other property
deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).

 

3.3 _No Shareholder Rights_. Except as provided in this Warrant, Holder will
not have any rights as a shareholder of the Company until the exercise of
this Warrant.

and from time to time with such information as Holder may reasonably request
for purposes of Holders compliance with regulatory, accounting and reporting
requirements applicable to Holder.

 

ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OF THE HOLDER

 

The Holder represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

 

4.1 _Purchase for Investment_. Holder is acquiring this Warrant and the Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant for its own account, for investment
and not for, with a view to, or in connection with, any sale or distribution
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act, and Holder will not offer,
sell or otherwise dispose of this Warrant and the Shares issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant except as permitted by the Securities Act and
any state securities law.

 



6 4.2 _Unregistered Securities; Legend_. Holder understands that the Warrants
and the Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the
Securities Act or any state securities law, by reason of their issuance in a
transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and such laws, that the Warrants and the Shares must be held indefinitely
unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act and such laws
or a subsequent disposition thereof is exempt from registration, that the
Warrants and the Shares shall bear a legend to such effect, and that
appropriate stop transfer instructions may be issued. Holder further
understands that such exemption depends upon, among other things, the _bona
fide_ nature of Holders investment intent expressed herein.

 

4.3 _Status of the Holder_. Holder has not been formed for the specific
purpose of acquiring the Warrants or the Shares. Holder understands the term
"accredited investor" as used in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
Act and represents and warrants to the Company that Holder is an "accredited
investor" for purposes of acquiring the Warrants and the Shares. If Holder is
not a United States person (as defined by Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986), Holder has satisfied itself as to the full observance
of the laws of its jurisdiction in connection with this Agreement, including
(a) the legal requirements within its jurisdiction for issuance of this
Warrant and the Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, (b) any foreign
exchange restrictions applicable to such purchase, (c) any governmental or
other consents that may need to be obtained, and (d) the income tax and other
tax consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the purchase, holding,
redemption, sale, or transfer of this Warrant or the Shares issuable
upon exercise. Holders subscription and payment for and continued beneficial
ownership of the Warrant and Shares issuable upon exercise will not violate
any applicable securities or other laws of the Holders jurisdiction.

 

4.4 _Knowledge and Experience; Economic Risk_. Holder has sufficient knowledge
and experience in business and financial matters and with respect to
investment in securities of privately held companies so as to enable it to
analyze and evaluate the merits and risks of the investment contemplated
hereby and is capable of protecting its interest in connection with this
transaction. Holder is able to bear the economic risk of such investment,
including a complete loss of the investment.

4.5 _Access to Information_. Holder acknowledges that Holder and its
representatives have had the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers
from officers and representatives of the Company concerning the Company and
its business and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
obtain any additional information which the Company possesses or can acquire
that is necessary to verify the accuracy of the information regarding the
Company herein set forth or otherwise desired in connection with its purchase
of the Warrants and the Shares.

4.6 _Rule 144_. Holder understands that the exemption from registration
afforded by Rule 144 (the provisions of which are known to such Investor)
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act
depends upon the satisfaction of various conditions, and that such exemption
is not currently available. 

 



7 ARTICLE 5

DISTRIBUTION MAY BE LAWFULLY EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT, UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE."

may not be transferred or assigned in whole or in part without compliance
with applicable federal and state securities laws by the transferor and the
transferee.

5.4 _Transfer Procedure_. Subject to the provisions of _Article 5.3_ , Holder
may transfer or pledge all or part of this Warrant or the Shares issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant to any transferee, provided, however, in connection
with any transfer, Holder will give the Company notice of the portion of the
Warrant being transferred with the name, address and taxpayer identification
number of the transferee and Holder will surrender this Warrant to the Company
for reissuance to the transferee(s) (and Holder if applicable). The Company
may refuse to transfer this Warrant or the Shares to any person who directly
competes with the Company, unless, in either case, the stock of the Company is
publicly traded.

 

5.5 _Notices_. All notices and other communications from the Company to the
Holder, or vice versa, shall be deemed delivered and effective when given
personally or mailed by first-class registered or certified mail, postage

exchange over a 20-day trading period, determined by Holder, that is within
the 100-day trading period ending on the trading day immediately after the
public announcement of the Corporate Reorganization described in _Article
1.6.1_ if the Acquirers stock is then traded on such exchange or system, or
the annualized standard deviation of daily-log returns (using a 262-day
annualization factor) of the closing bid or sale prices (whichever is
applicable) in the over-the-counter market over a 20-day trading period,
determined by the Holder, that is within the 100-day trading period ending on
the trading day immediately after the public announcement of the Corporate
Reorganization if the Acquirers stock is then actively traded in the over-
