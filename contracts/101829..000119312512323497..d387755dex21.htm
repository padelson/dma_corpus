following the day on which all of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) are satisfied or waived, and (ii) the Business Day following the
final day of the Marketing Period or such earlier date as may be specified by

(v) if such Seller is (A) not a United States person, within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, and (B) transfers pursuant to this Agreement

Purchaser a duly executed certificate certifying that the shares of such
Transferred Company are not a U.S. real property interest within the meaning

written statement setting forth Parents good faith estimate of (i) Working
Capital of the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, (ii) Indebtedness of the
Transferred Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and
(iii) Cash (including the amounts of Operating Cash and Trapped Cash) of the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the " _Statement of Estimated Closing Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness_ "), which shall be accompanied by a notice (the
" _Closing Notice_ ") that sets forth (x) Parents determination of the
Closing Adjustment and the Purchase Price after giving effect to the Closing
Adjustment and (y) the account or accounts to which Purchaser shall transfer
funds pursuant to  _Section 2.3_.

(b) The Closing Notice shall specify an amount (the " _Closing Adjustment_ ")

Estimated Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness _less_ (x) the Target
Working Capital Amount _less_ (y) the amount of Indebtedness of the
Transferred Companies set forth in the Statement of Estimated Closing Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness _plus_ (z) the amount of (A) Operating Cash,
and (B) Excess Cash other than Trapped Cash, of the Transferred Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries set forth in the Statement of Estimated Closing
Working Capital and Net Indebtedness. If the Closing Adjustment is a positive
amount, then the Purchase Price shall be equal to (i) the Pre-Adjustment
Amount increased by the absolute value of the Closing Adjustment, (ii) _less_
, if the Acceptance Notice is not delivered by Parent to Purchaser prior to
the Closing Date, the amount by which the Purchase Price is decreased
pursuant to _Section 2.10_, and (iii) _less_ the amount (if any) by which
the Purchase Price is decreased pursuant to _Section 5.21 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_. If the Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then
the Purchase Price shall be equal to (I) the Pre-Adjustment Amount decreased
by the absolute value of the Closing Adjustment, (II) _less_ , if the
Acceptance Notice is not delivered by Parent to Purchaser prior to the
Closing Date, the amount by which the Purchase Price is decreased pursuant to
_Section 2.10_, and (III) _less_ the amount (if any) by which the Purchase
Price is decreased pursuant to  _Section 5.21 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_.

(c) The Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness
shall be prepared in accordance with the Working Capital Principles attached
as _Schedule III_ hereto (the " _Working Capital Principles_ "), applied
consistently with their application in connection with the preparation of the
most-recent Audited Financial Statements.

2.5 _Post-Closing Statements_. (a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement of (i) Working
Capital of the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, (ii) the Indebtedness of the
Transferred Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and
(iii) the Cash (including the amounts of Operating Cash and Trapped Cash) of
the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (the " _Initial Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness Statement_ "). The Initial Working Capital and Net Indebtedness
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Working Capital Principles
applied consistently with their application in connection with the preparation
of the most-recent Audited Financial Statements. Parent and the Sellers will,
and

 



-18-   will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their accountants to,
cooperate with and assist Purchaser in the preparation of the Initial Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement, including by providing reasonable
access to their books, records and work papers and making available personnel
to the extent reasonably required during normal business hours; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the accountants of Parent and the Sellers shall not be
obliged to make any work papers available to Purchaser or its representatives
except in accordance with such accountants normal disclosure procedures and
then only after such Person has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
accountants.

(b) During the forty-five (45)-day period immediately following Parents
receipt of the Initial Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement (the "
_Review Period_ "), Parent, the Sellers and their representatives will be
permitted to review Purchasers books, records and work papers relating to
the Initial Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement. Purchaser will,
and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants to,
cooperate with and assist Parent and the Sellers in the conduct of such
review, including by providing reasonable access to such books, records and
work papers and making available personnel to the extent reasonably required
during normal business hours; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants
of Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to Parent,
the Sellers or their representatives except in accordance with such
accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Person has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(c) Each of Parent, the Sellers and Purchaser agrees that, following the
Closing through the date that the Final Working Capital and Net Indebtedness
Statement becomes final and binding, it will not take or permit to be taken
any actions with respect to any accounting books, records, policies or
procedures on which the Financial Statements or the Initial Working Capital
and Net Indebtedness Statement is based, or on which the Final Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement are to be based, that would materially
impede or delay the determination of the amount of Working Capital or Net
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date or the preparation of the Initial Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement or the Final Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods provided by
this Agreement.

2.6 _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_. (a) Parent shall notify
Purchaser in writing prior to the expiration of the Review Period if Parent
believes the Initial Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement contains
mathematical errors or was not prepared in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_,
such that a Post-Closing Adjustment would be payable pursuant to _Section
2.7_, which notice shall describe the basis for such belief (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "). If no Notice of Disagreement is received by Purchaser prior
to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Initial Working Capital and
Net Indebtedness Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Parent
and shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance with the
last sentence of _Section 2.6(c)_.

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Parent and Purchaser shall seek
in good faith to 

 



-19-   resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

(c) If at the end of the Resolution Period Parent and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Parent and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness Statement marked to indicate those items that are not in dispute)
to (i) an independent certified public accounting firm in the United States
of national reputation mutually acceptable to Parent and Purchaser (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ ") or (ii) if Parent and Purchaser are unable
to agree upon such a firm within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the
Resolution Period, then within an additional ten (10) Business Days, Parent
and Purchaser shall each select one such firm and those two firms shall,
within ten (10) Business Days after their selection, select a third such
firm, in which event "Independent Accounting Firm" shall mean such third firm.
Within thirty (30) days after the Independent Accounting Firms selection,
the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final determination, binding on
the parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the items
in the Initial Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement which remain in
dispute as indicated in the Notice of Disagreement which Parent and Purchaser
have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. With respect to each
disputed item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of
either Parent or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less
than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Parent in the Notice of
Disagreement or by Purchaser in the Initial Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness Statement with respect to such disputed item. The statement
of Working Capital and Net Indebtedness that is final and binding on the
parties, as determined either through agreement of the parties pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ or through the action of the Independent
Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_, is referred to as the "
_Final Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement_."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Parent and the Sellers
on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other hand. During the review by the
Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective accountants to,
each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such
personnel, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may be
reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under _Section 2.6(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the accountants of Parent or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work
papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with
such accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such firm
has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. In acting under
this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled to the
privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

2.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be
equal to the sum of the following:

(x) the amount of Working Capital of the Transferred Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries set forth in the Final Working Capital and Net

 



-20-   Indebtedness Statement _less_ the amount of Working Capital of the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries set forth in the
Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness, _plus_

(y) the amount of Indebtedness of the Transferred Companies set forth in the
Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness _less_
the amount of Indebtedness of the Transferred Companies set forth in the Final
Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement, _plus_

 

(z) (A) the amount of (i) Operating Cash, _plus_ (ii) Excess Cash other than
Trapped Cash of the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries
set forth in the Final Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement _less_
(B) the amount of (i) Operating Cash, _plus_ (ii) Excess Cash other than
Trapped Cash, of the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries
set forth in the Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness.

If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay
in cash to Parent (or one or more Affiliates designated by Parent) the amount
of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative
amount, then Parent (or an Affiliate designated by Parent) shall pay in cash
to Purchaser the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment.
Any such payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement becomes such, together with
interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date until the date of
payment.

2.8  _Purchase Price Allocations_. (a) Parent, Sellers and Purchaser shall
allocate the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts) among the Shares for
Tax purposes in accordance with _Schedule IV_ (the " _Shares Allocation_ ").
The Shares Allocation shall be appropriately revised for any adjustments to
the Purchase Price under this Agreement (including pursuant to _Section
2.7_).

 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare a schedule setting forth the proposed fair market
values of the assets of each U.S. Company with respect to which the parties
agree to make a joint Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to _Section 7.10_
(or that has been converted to a limited liability company pursuant to
_Section 5.17(b)_) (the " _Asset Valuation_ ") and deliver it to Parent
within sixty (60) days following the date that the Final Working Capital and
Net Indebtedness Statement becomes final and binding (or such shorter period
otherwise required by applicable Law), for review and approval. Purchaser
shall provide Parent promptly upon request with such additional information
reasonably requested by Parent relating to the proposed Asset Valuation.
Parent shall have thirty (30) days after the later of the delivery of (i) the
proposed Asset Valuation or (ii) any additional information requested by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.8(b)_ (such later date, the " _Parent
Objection Period_ "), to object in writing, and if it does not object within
such period, Parent shall be deemed to have accepted the proposed Asset
Valuation and it shall become final on the day after the expiration of the
Parent Objection Period. If Parent objects to the proposed Asset
Valuation, it shall deliver written notice of such objection within the
Parent Objection Period, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection. The parties thereafter shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
differences regarding the Asset Valuation and if they cannot agree in fifteen
(15) days after Parents delivery of a written

 



-21-   objection to Purchaser, the matters in dispute (but only the matters in
dispute) shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute solely on the basis
of presentations by the parties and not by independent review and shall issue
a written decision as to the disputed matters within fifteen (15) days after
submission of the matter to the Independent Accounting Firm and its decision
shall be final and binding on the parties. The costs of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne by Purchaser and Parent equally.

(c) Neither Parent, Sellers, Purchaser nor their respective Affiliates shall
file any Tax Return (including IRS Forms 8883) or otherwise take, or agree to
take, any position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with (i) the Shares
Allocation pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ or the Asset Valuation as finally
agreed to by the parties or resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ (such allocations, the " _Final Allocations_
"), except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law);  _provided_ _that_ nothing contained herein shall
prevent Parent, Sellers, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates from
settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity
based upon or arising out of the Final Allocations, and neither Parent,
Sellers, Purchaser nor their respective Affiliates shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by a
Governmental Entity challenging such Final Allocations. Parent and
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly
notify each other in the event of an examination, audit or other proceeding
regarding the Final Allocations. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement
that is treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes
pursuant to _Section 7.9_ shall be allocated to the purchase price of the
Transferred Company to which (or the Transferred Company with respect to whose
Subsidiary) such indemnity payment relates.

2.9 _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_. The transfer of each Foreign Transferred
Company organized in a jurisdiction in which local Laws require observance of
specified formalities or procedures to legally effect a transfer of such
entity will be effected pursuant to short-form acquisition agreements (the "
_Foreign Acquisition Agreements_ ") on a country-by-country basis. Each
Foreign Acquisition Agreement shall be in substantially the same form as the
form of Foreign Acquisition Agreement attached as _Exhibit C_ to this
Agreement, except, as Parent and Purchaser may agree, including for: (i) the
deletion of provisions which are inapplicable to such Foreign Transferred
Company; (ii) such changes as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements of
applicable local Law; and (iii) such changes as may be reasonably agreed upon
by Parent and Purchaser regarding employees and employee benefit matters in
order to adapt such agreement to the particular circumstances of the relevant
Foreign Transferred Company and country;  _provided_ in each case that the
Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal transfer
of the applicable Transferred Company or Subsidiary of a Transferred Company
and shall not have any effect on the value being received by Purchaser or
given by the Sellers, or the terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the allocation of assets and Liabilities as
between them, all of which shall be determined by this Agreement, or in any
way modify, amend, or constitute a waiver of, any provision of this Agreement
or any other Ancillary Agreement.

2.10 _French Works Council Process_. (a) The Parties acknowledge that, under
the French Labor Code, the works councils of the French Entities will need to
be informed and

 



-22-   consulted (such process of informing and consulting, the " _Consultation
Process_ ") with respect to the sale of the share capital or other equity
interests of Sundstrand International SA, Dosatron International SAS, Milton
Roy Europe, SA and Milton Roy Mixing SA (collectively, the " _French Entities_
" and, such share capital or other equity interests, collectively, the "
_French Interests_ "). Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, unless and until Parent has executed and
delivered to Purchaser the Acceptance Notice, (i) the provisions of this
_Article II_ shall not be effective with respect to the French Interests
pending completion of the Consultation Process (provided that the other
provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply to the French Interests),
(ii) for the purpose of this _Article II_ (and only this _Article II_ ) the
French Interests shall not be considered Shares and the French Entities shall
not be considered Transferred Companies and (iii) the Purchase Price and the
Pre-Adjustment Amount shall each be reduced by the French Purchase Price.

(b) On the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Letter attached as
_Exhibit A_  hereto (the " _French Offer Letter_ "), including the price
specified therein (the " _French Purchase Price_ "), Purchaser has irrevocably
offered to acquire the French Interests and to have the provisions of this 
_Article II_ apply to such French Interests following completion of the
Consultation Process. Upon delivery to Purchaser, following completion of the
Consultation Process by Parent, of the executed Acceptance Notice attached as
Schedule III to the French Offer Letter (the " _Acceptance Notice_ "), this
_Article II_ shall be effective with respect to the French Interests, the
French Interests shall be included in the Shares, the French Entities shall be
included in the Transferred Companies as though they had always been so
included and the Purchase Price and the Pre-Adjustment Amount shall no longer
be reduced by the French Purchase Price. (It is understood that the Purchase
Price and the Pre-Adjustment Amount each assumes delivery of the Acceptance
Notice and therefore already includes the French Purchase Price.) The parties
shall reasonably cooperate with one another and with the works councils in
connection with the Consultation Process. 

2.11 _China JV Sale Restructuring_. If, after the date hereof, Parent
determines that an alternative method of effecting the Sale of the China JV
Entities (a " _China JV Sale Restructuring_ ") would be beneficial to Parent,
Parent shall notify Purchaser in writing of its request to effect a China JV
Sale Restructuring and Purchaser agrees to reasonably consider such request
in good faith. If Purchaser and Parent agree that it is advisable to undertake
the China JV Sale Restructuring, Parent, the Sellers and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate to amend this Agreement and take any other
actions deemed (by agreement of the parties) necessary or advisable to
implement the China JV Sale Restructuring on terms acceptable to the parties.
For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, if the China
JV Sale Restructuring would (a) have adverse Tax consequences to Purchaser,
the Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, (b) materially
impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (c) otherwise materially adversely affect Purchaser, any
Transferred Company or any Subsidiary thereof or the Business, and Purchaser
does not consent to the China JV Sale Restructuring, in no event shall
Purchaser be deemed to have failed to consider Parents request in good
faith.

2.12 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts that Purchaser is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such payments under the
Code or any provision of state,

 



-23-   local, or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that Purchaser withholds such amounts
with respect to any Person and properly remits such withheld amounts to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to or on behalf of such Person. Purchaser shall promptly, and
in any event no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, notify
Parent in writing if Purchaser determines that withholding is required with
respect to any portion of the Purchase Price.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND THE SELLERS

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Purchaser prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Section or subsection of this _Article
III_ shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other Section or subsection
of this _Article III_ to the extent the applicability of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), Parent and the Sellers,
jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Purchaser as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent and the
Sellers and each Transferred Company and each Subsidiary thereof is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of
Parent and the Sellers and each Transferred Company and each Subsidiary
thereof (i) has all requisite corporate or other organizational power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its businesses as now being conducted and (ii) is qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a
complete and accurate list of each Transferred Companys Subsidiaries, along
with each Subsidiarys jurisdiction of organization and number of authorized,
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests, and
all holder(s) thereof. Parent and the Sellers have made available to
Purchaser prior to the date hereof complete and correct copies of the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries articles of
incorporation and by-laws or comparable organizational and
governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement.

3.2 _Capitalization of the Transferred Companies_. The Shares are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Sellers, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens. Except for the
Shares and any interest held by a Transferred Company or its wholly owned
Subsidiaries, there are no shares of common stock, preferred stock or other
equity interests of any Transferred Company or its Subsidiaries authorized,
reserved, issued or outstanding, and there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, subscriptions, options, warrants, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, convertible, exercisable, or
exchangeable securities or other agreements, arrangements or commitments of
any character relating to the issued or unissued share capital or other
ownership

 



-24-   interest in any of the Transferred Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries or any other securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of any Transferred Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, and no securities evidencing such rights are authorized,
issued or outstanding. None of the Transferred Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations which provide the holders thereof the right to vote (or are
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities having the

characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code) as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No U.S. Business Employee is entitled to a
gross-up of any Taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.

increases in or funding of any payments or benefits or any loan forgiveness.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF PURCHASER

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent and the
Sellers prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any Section of
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Section or subsection of
this _Article IV_ shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other Section
or subsection of this _Article IV_ to the extent the applicability of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), Purchaser

its business as now being conducted and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign limited liability company in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, impair in any material respect the ability of Parent and the
Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Sale.

4.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Purchaser has all necessary
limited liability company power and authority, and has taken all action
necessary, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by

 



-38-   Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent and the Sellers, constitutes, and each Ancillary
Agreement when executed and delivered by Purchaser, and, assuming the due

and the Sellers party thereto, shall constitute, a valid, legal and binding
agreement of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its

the items described clauses (i) through (iii) of in the preceding sentence,
and except as would not impair in any material respect the ability of Parent
and the Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Sale, neither the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser nor the consummation
by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement will (A) conflict with or result in any breach, violation
or infringement of any provision of the respective articles of incorporation
or by-laws (or similar governing documents) of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) result in a breach, violation or infringement of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
(or give rise to the creation of any Lien, except for Permitted Liens, or any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of its
properties or assets may be bound or (C) violate or infringe any Law
applicable to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

4.4 _Financing_.

Financing Sources party thereto have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the
purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including funding the Purchase Price) and related fees and expenses (such
committed financing, together with, unless the context requires otherwise, any
debt securities to be issued in lieu thereof, the " _Debt Financing_ ").
Purchaser has delivered to Parent a true and complete copy of the respective
executed commitment letters, each dated as of the date hereof, between
Purchaser

 



-39-   and each Guarantor (collectively, the " _Equity Financing Commitments_ "
and, together with the Debt Financing Commitment, the " _Financing
Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the Guarantors have committed, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest in Purchaser the cash
amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, (i) none of the
Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, (ii) no such amendment or
modification is contemplated, and (iii) the respective commitments contained
in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, no withdrawal or rescission

with only fee amounts, pricing caps and certain economic terms (none of which

redacted) and customary engagement letters with respect to debt securities
that may form part of the Debt Financing (none of which would adversely affect

there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements related to the

conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments
delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser, any other party thereto under any of the Financing
Commitments. Assuming the satisfaction in full of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , as of the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to

Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, Purchaser
will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (1) pay the Purchase
Price, (2) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Purchaser
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (3)
satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Purchaser contemplated

a condition to any of Purchasers obligations hereunder.

Carlyle Partners V, L.P. and BC European Capital IX (collectively, the "
_Guarantors_ ") is entering into a limited guarantee with Parent

and its Subsidiaries will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 4.5_, "
_Solvent_ " means, with respect to any Person, that:

(a) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
consolidated assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries shall be greater than

experience in financial and business matters, and is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of its purchase of the Shares. Without limiting the other
provisions hereof, Purchaser confirms that Parent and the Sellers have made
available to Purchaser and Purchasers agents the opportunity to ask
questions of the officers and management employees of Parent and of the
Sellers, and of the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as

Sellers and the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and
to acquire additional information about the business and financial condition
of the Business, and Purchaser confirms that it has made an independent

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN _ARTICLE III_ OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND IN
PARTICULAR, WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OR PROPERTIES OF THE
TRANSFERRED COMPANIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES.

Purchaser and its representatives shall not communicate with any of the
employees of the Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries (other
than those employees listed on _Section 5.1(b) of the Purchaser Disclosure

request, to keep Parent reasonably informed on a regular basis of its
communications with such employees) without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Sellers nor
any Transferred Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or disclose information pursuant to 

 



-42-    _Section 5.1(a)_ where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or

Parents or the Sellers rights of discovery. The terms and conditions of
_Section 5.1(b)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any access provided to
Parent, the Sellers and their representatives pursuant to this _Section
5.1(c)_.

 

(d) Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of each Transferred
Company and its Subsidiaries existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy

Agreement, to include in the definition of "Authorized Recipients" contained
therein all existing or prospective equity investors, co-investors and direct
and indirect equity and debt financing sources of Purchaser and
its stockholders and its and their respective Affiliates and their respective
agents, advisors and representatives. The execution of this Agreement shall
constitute written consent by Parent pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement
to all actions by the Purchaser Related Parties expressly permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement that would otherwise be restricted under
Section 7 of the Confidentiality Agreement, which consent shall automatically
terminate if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_. Carlyle
Investment Management L.L.C. and BC Partners Inc. are express, intended third
party

 



-43-   beneficiaries of the two immediately preceding sentences. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall instruct each
Person (other than the Purchaser Related Parties) in possession of
confidential information about the Business that was furnished within the last
three (3) years by or on behalf of Parent in connection with any actual or
potential proposal by such Person to acquire the Business (or any
portion thereof) to promptly return or destroy all such information. Prior to
the termination of this Agreement, without Purchasers prior written consent,
Parent shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality agreement to
which Parent is a party that was entered into in connection with its process
relating to a sale of the Business (or any portion thereof).

cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental
Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information required under
the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or filings with any
Governmental Entity responsible for or having jurisdiction over antitrust,
competition, trade regulation and/or foreign investment) required to be
obtained or made by Purchaser or Parent or the Sellers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Sale, and (iii) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Sale
and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of
Parent, the Sellers and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to this Agreement and shall not
knowingly take any action after the date of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any such Governmental
Entity necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall each keep
the others reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the Sale and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all
required consents, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions
by, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Sale, including by working
cooperatively in connection with any sales, divestitures or dispositions of
assets or businesses if and to the extent undertaken pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_. In that regard, prior to the Closing,
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.2_, each party shall
promptly consult with the other parties to this Agreement to provide any
necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence,
provide the other parties (or their counsel) copies of) all filings made by
such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by
such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the Sale. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and
_Section 5.2_, each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other
parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with
copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications, advise the other
parties orally of) any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
the Sale, and permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any

 



-44-   proposed written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
Governmental Entity. If any party to this Agreement or any representative of
such party receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Sale, then such
party will use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made,
promptly and after consultation with the other parties to this Agreement, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. No party shall
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the Sale (or make oral submissions at meetings or in
telephone or other conversations) unless it consults with the other parties
in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.2_, each party shall
furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Sale,
and furnish the other parties with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such
Governmental Entity. Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other parties under this _Section 5.3_ as
"outside counsel/corporate in-house antitrust counsel only." Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel and corporate in-house antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel and corporate in-house antitrust counsel
to employees (other than corporate in-house antitrust counsel), officers, or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Purchaser, Parent or the Sellers, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable legal privilege concerns. To the extent that transfers of any
Permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Sale, the parties
hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

(c) Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to file, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, notifications
under the HSR Act, and Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as practicable, any
other filings and/or notifications under applicable Competition Laws. In the
event that the parties receive a formal request for additional information or
documentary materials after an initial notification pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Competition Laws (a " _Second Request_ "), the parties will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request, as
applicable, as promptly as possible and counsel for both parties will
reasonably cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review
process.

 

(d) Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Sale under the HSR Act, the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or foreign
or supranational Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions

 



-45-   having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " _Competition Laws_ "). In connection therewith, if any Action
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Sale as
violative of any Competition Laws, Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to vigorously
contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or
restricts consummation of the Sale, including by vigorously pursuing
all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this
_Section 5.3(d)_ shall limit the right of any party hereto to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ so long as such party hereto has, up
to the time of termination, complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Agreement. Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or
other Competition Laws with respect to the Sale as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement. 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Competition Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur at such time
as Purchaser is otherwise required to effect the Closing (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product
lines or assets of the Transferred Companies, Purchaser, and their
respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Purchasers or its
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Transferred Companies, Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries, in each
case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction, in any Action under
any Competition Laws, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
Closing, and in that regard Purchaser shall and, if requested by Purchaser,
Parent or the Sellers shall (but if not so requested by Purchaser shall not),
agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit
to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or
Purchasers, Parents or the Sellers, or their respective
Subsidiaries ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of the Transferred Companies, Purchaser, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. All such efforts by Purchaser shall be unconditional and shall
not be qualified by best efforts and no actions taken pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(e)_ shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
and the Sellers shall not be obligated to take any action that is not
conditioned on the Closing or that relates to any business or Subsidiary not
transferred pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) Whether or not the Sale is consummated, Parent and Purchaser shall each be
responsible for one-half of all fees and payments (including filing fees) to
any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers
from any Governmental Entity pursuant to this _Section 5.3_, _provided_
_that_ , notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party shall be
required to make any payment to any Person to obtain any consent, approval or
waiver from such Person required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, other

 



-46-   than nominal administrative, processing or similar charges, or other legally
required filing fees in connection with filings with any Governmental Entity.

-53-  5.10 _Insurance_. (a) Subject to _Section 5.10(b)_, and except as set forth
on _Section 5.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, which includes all
insurance policies (other than fronting policies) held by any member of the
Parent Group that provide coverage for Losses relating to asbestos or
silicosis Actions of the type described in _Section 3.7 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Designated Parent Policies_ "), and for the
Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries (or their
respective predecessors) insurance policies (collectively with the
Designated Parent Policies, the " _Specified Policies_ "), from and after the
Closing Date, the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries
shall cease to be insured by Parent, the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries) insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs,
and neither Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries shall have any access, right,
title or interest to or in any such insurance policies (including, without
limitation, to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to
proceeds) to cover any assets of the Transferred Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries or any Liability arising from the operation of the
Business on or after the Closing, except for the Specified Policies. Parent or
the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates may, to be effective at the
Closing, amend any insurance policies (other than the Specified Policies) in
the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this _Section 5.10(a)_.
From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and the Business. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 10.2_, at the Closing, Purchaser agrees to
take over and assume all the known and incurred but not reported claims of
the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and the Business,
which have been incurred as of the Closing Date, and Purchaser agrees to be
responsible to pay such claims until they are finally settled and disclosed.
Subject to _Section 5.10(b)_, Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to
seek to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of any Transferred Company
or any Subsidiary of a Transferred Company or the Business under or in
respect of any past or current insurance policy (other than the Specified
Policies) under which any Transferred Company or Affiliate thereof or the
Business is a named insured.

 

(b) Parent, the Sellers and their Affiliates will keep each of the workers
compensation insurance policies (" _Workers Compensation Policies_ ") that
apply to current or former Business Employees, including the Workers
Compensation Policies set forth on _Section 5.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_, or suitable replacements therefor, in full force and effect
through and after the Closing. Notwithstanding _Section 5.10(a)_, with
respect to claims for or relating to acts, omissions, events or circumstances
relating to current or former Business Employees that occurred or existed
prior to the Closing Date that are covered by Workers Compensation Policies
(" _Pre-Closing WC Claims_ "), Parent and the Sellers hereby authorize
Purchaser to report Pre-Closing WC Claims directly to the provider of such
Workers Compensation Policies (the " _WC Insurer_ ") and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchasers efforts to obtain the
benefit of such insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
shall keep Parent and the Sellers reasonably informed and shall exclusively
bear and shall, pursuant to the following sentence, repay or reimburse the
Sellers for the amount of any Losses incurred by a member of the Parent Group
as a result of any such claim, including any deductibles or self-insured
retentions associated with any such claims under the Workers Compensation
Policies, and shall be liable for and indemnify Parent, the Sellers and their
Affiliates against all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible
amounts of such claims. Parent and the Sellers shall, on a quarterly basis,
submit an invoice to Purchaser for any amounts

 



-54-   payable to the WC Insurer in respect of such claims, which Purchaser shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) days) reimburse to Parent or the
applicable Seller. Following the Closing, Parent and the Sellers shall not,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to not, release, commute, buy-back
or otherwise eliminate insurance coverage under any of the Workers
Compensation Policies with respect to acts, omissions, events or
circumstances relating to Business Employees that occurred or existed prior to
the Closing Date.

(c) Following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause each other member of
the Parent Group to, use its reasonable best efforts to make available to
Purchaser upon Purchasers request, the Transferred Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries all Designated Parent Policies with respect of all
asbestos and silicosis product liability Actions of the type listed on
_Section 3.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ pending or asserted against
Purchaser, the Transferred Companies or their Subsidiaries (each such claim,
a " _Covered Claim_ "), including claims currently being processed under such
Designated Parent Policies for the asbestos and silicosis Actions described in
_Section 3.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. To the extent permitted
under any Designated Parent Policy, (i) Purchaser or any Transferred Company
or Subsidiary thereof may, after consultation with Parent, submit any Covered
Claim the appropriate insurer under the applicable Designated Parent Policy
(" _Purchaser Insurance Claim_ ") or (ii) Parent, upon the written request of
Purchaser, will submit any Purchaser Insurance Claim on behalf of the
applicable Transferred Company or Subsidiary. Parent shall, and shall
cause each other member of the Parent Group to, provide reasonable assistance
in connection with the pursuit of such claim with the insurer, including
submitting such Purchaser Insurance Claim on behalf of the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, acting as the direct contact
with such insurer, using reasonable best efforts to pursue such claim on
behalf of Purchaser, the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries and remitting any payment in respect of such claim from insurers
to Purchaser. Without in any way limiting or amending any other rights that
any Purchaser Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (e.g., because the matter giving rise to such claim is a matter
for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the matter giving rise to
such claim, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries to, be responsible for satisfying any
applicable deductible, or self-insured retention under the Designated Parent
Policies relating to any Purchaser Insurance Claim, and Purchaser shall
reimburse the members of the Parent Group for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred following Closing in connection with submission or pursuit
of any Purchaser Insurance Claim at the request of Purchaser, any Transferred
Company or any of their Subsidiaries.

 

5.11 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any party is
prosecuting, contesting or defending any legal proceeding, Action,
investigation, charge, claim, or demand by a third party in connection with
(a) any transactions contemplated under this Agreement (other than an action
brought against or by any party hereto or any Affiliate of such party),
or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity,
practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or
transaction relating to, in connection with or arising from the Business or
the Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, at the reasonable
written request of such party, each other party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (and its and their officers and employees) to,
cooperate with such party and its counsel in such prosecution, contest or
defense, including, without limitation, making available

 



-55-   its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its non-privileged
books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such
prosecution, contest or defense, at the sole cost and expense of the
prosecuting, contesting or defending party.

5.12 _Ancillary Agreements_. At the Closing, Parent and the relevant
Seller(s) and Purchaser shall execute and deliver the Transition Services

_Exhibits B_ and _C_ , respectively. Parent and Purchaser shall negotiate in
good faith after the date hereof the ACE License Agreement and the Dijon

the terms and conditions set forth on _Exhibits D_ , _F_ , _G_ , and _H _
respectively, and on such other terms and conditions and in such a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Purchaser, and (x) Parent shall cause the

(b) Parent and the Sellers agree that Purchaser has the right and authority
to endorse, without recourse, any check or other evidence of indebtedness
received by Purchaser in respect of any Receivable and Parent and the Sellers
shall furnish Purchaser such evidence of this authority as Purchaser may
request.

(c) Purchaser shall promptly pay or deliver to Parent any monies or checks
which have been sent after the Closing Date to Purchaser to the extent they
are not due to the Business or any Transferred Company or any Subsidiary of a
Transferred Company.

5.15 _Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition_. (a) For a period of eighteen (18)
months from the Closing Date, none of Parent, its Subsidiaries nor any of
their officers, directors

 



-56-   or employees shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment (whether

management who was an employee of a Transferred Company or any Subsidiary of
a Transferred Company immediately prior to the Closing or other management-

Party shall not, either directly or indirectly as a stockholder, investor,

resulting ownership and operation by a Restricted Party of a Person that

measured for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to the date of such
purchaser, shall not constitute a breach of this  _Section 5.15_; (ii) the
purchase or resulting ownership and operation by a Restricted Party of a
Person that derives more than $25,000,000 in annual revenues from Competitive
Businesses (calculated as described in (i) above) but less than fifteen
percent (15%) of its total annual revenues from Competitive Businesses,
measured for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to the date of such
purchase, shall not constitute a breach of this _Section 5.15(b)_; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of clauses (i) (for so long as such
acquired Person derives less than $25,000,000 in annual revenues from the
Competitive Business) and (ii), Parent shall not, and shall cause each member
of the Parent Group not to, permit application of know-how in the possession
of or available to the Parent Group unique to impellers, inducers and/or
diffusers (or combinations thereof) or high-speed gear boxes to flow control
products designed, manufactured or sold by any such acquired Person engaged
in a Competitive Business; (iii) a Restricted Party may acquire a Person or
business that derives (x) $25,000,000 or more in annual revenues from a
Competitive Business, or (y) fifteen percent (15%) or more of its total
annual revenues from a Competitive Business, as long as that Restricted Party
shall commit to, and shall, divest to an unaffiliated third party the
Competitive Business as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event not

( _provided_ , _however_ , that such one (1)-year period shall be extended to
the date on which all approvals from a Governmental Entity required to

following the acquisition of such Person or business) if such approvals are
not

 



-57-   received by the first anniversary following the acquisition of such Person
or business); (iv) subject to clause (vii) below, nothing in this _Section
5.15(b)_ shall be construed to prohibit the Restricted Parties from

materially and adversely affect market share of the Business for competitive
product sales with current and historical customers of the Business; (v) the
Restricted Parties may, directly or indirectly, hold publicly traded interests
in or securities of any Person engaged in a Competitive Business to the extent
that such investment does not, directly or indirectly, confer on the

Person; and (vi) the parties have agreed to the matters set forth in _Section
5.15(b)(vi) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Restricted Party_ " shall mean (i)
Parent and (ii) each Subsidiary of Parent for the period that such Subsidiary
is such (including Persons that become a Subsidiary of Parent after the date
hereof). For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Competitive Business_ " shall
mean the business (including any Person that engages in the business), as

(d) The parties acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this _Section
5.15_ are reasonable in scope and duration in light of the nature, size and
location of the Business. The parties further acknowledge that the
restrictions contained in this _Section 5.15_ are necessary to protect
Purchasers significant investment in the Business, including its goodwill. It
is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this _Section
5.15_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law. If
all or part of this _Section 5.15_ is held invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. If any part
of this _Section 5.15_ is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope,
activity or subject, such part will be construed by limiting and reducing it
so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible under applicable Law
or public policy.

 

5.16 _ITAR Matters_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will take all actions
necessary such that none of the Transferred Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries will be required as of the Closing to be registered under the

including by causing all non-Business technical data and products (if any)

on the terms described therein and (ii) may cause its Affiliates, including
the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, to complete the
transactions described on _Section 5.17(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
on the terms described therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
have the ability to amend  _Section 5.17(a)_ or _Section 5.17(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_ after the date hereof with the prior written
consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(b) If requested in writing by Purchaser at least fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with Purchaser and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to, immediately prior to
the Closing, convert any Transferred Company that is incorporated as a
corporation under the Laws of any state of the United States into a single-
member limited liability company of the same state that is treated as an
entity disregarded from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in
which case the limited liability company surviving such conversion will
constitute a Transferred Company for all purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _that_ (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to complete any such conversion unless Purchaser shall have notified
Parent in writing that (x) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_
and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions

arising out of or relating to actions taken by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries at the request of Purchaser pursuant to this sentence and (iii)
any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of Parent and
the Sellers that would not have occurred but for any action taken by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries at the request of Purchaser pursuant to this
sentence shall be disregarded for all purposes of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the failure of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
effect any action or request to be taken under this _Section 5.17(b)_ shall
not be deemed a breach of this Agreement or otherwise affect the Parties
ability to effect the Closing in a timely manner.

Permits listed in _Section 5.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ relating
to current operations conducted at the facility located in the industrial zone
of Dijon at 13  15 Bd Eiffel 21604 Longvic, France

 



-59-   (the " _Dijon Facility_ ") apply to operations conducted by the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries relating to the Business at the
Dijon Facility (" _Sundyne Dijon_ ") and to operations conducted by
Affiliates of Parent and the Sellers (other than the Transferred Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries) at the Dijon Facility not relating to the
Business (" _Aerospace Dijon_ "), with such Permits currently being held in
the name of Sundstrand International, S.A. Purchaser, Parent and the Sellers
shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Permits to be
divided between Sundyne Dijon and Aerospace Dijon, with the authorizations
under such Permits relating to Aerospace Dijons use of, activities at, and
conduct of the Business at the Dijon Facility to be split from the Permits
retained by Sundstrand International, S.A. and covered separately under new
Permits issued to HS Aerospace Dijon SAS. If and to the extent that such
Permits cannot be divided between Sundyne Dijon and Aerospace Dijon,
Sundstrand International, S.A. will continue to hold and maintain such
Permits (the " _Shared Permits_ "), and HS Aerospace Dijon SAS may to the
extent consistent with Law conduct its uses, operations and activities under
the authority of such Shared Permits, subject to the following terms and
conditions: 

(b) Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of related facilities,
sampling, monitoring, reporting and other actions required under such Shared
Permits shall be allocated as between HS Aerospace Dijon SAS and Sundstrand
International, S.A. in the manner set forth in the Dijon Agreements.

pay for shared costs and services (whether provided by HS Aerospace Dijon SAS

5.19 _Financing_.

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate, and obtain the proceeds of, the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) described in the
Debt Financing Commitment and shall not permit any amendment or modification
to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt
Financing Commitment if such amendment, modification or waiver would (x)
reduce the aggregate amount

 



-60-   of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid
or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees) unless the
Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (y) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to
the receipt of the Debt Financing or (z) reasonably be expected to (I) delay
or prevent the Closing, (II) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to
occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser may amend the Debt Financing
Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of
the date hereof, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or
in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the
Closing. Purchaser shall promptly upon execution deliver to Parent copies of
any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver to the Financing
Commitments. For purposes of this  _Section 5.19(a)_, references to
"Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments as permitted to be amended or modified by this _Section 5.19(a)_
and references to "Financing Commitments" or "Debt Financing Commitment"
shall include such documents as permitted to be amended or modified by this
_Section 5.19(a)_. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitment until the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, (ii)
satisfy all conditions and covenants applicable to Purchaser in the Debt
Financing Commitment (including by consummating the financing pursuant to the
terms of the Equity Financing Commitments substantially concurrently with the
funding of the Debt Financing) at or prior to the Closing and otherwise comply
with its obligations thereunder, in each case, that are within Purchasers
control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by, or no
less favorable to Purchaser in the aggregate than, the Debt
Financing Commitment, (iv) consummate the Financing at the Closing, (v)
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment and (vi) subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, cause the lenders and other Persons providing the Financing to
fund on the Closing Date the Financing contemplated to be funded on the
Closing Date by the Debt Financing Commitment (or such lesser amount as may be
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby). Purchaser shall
(I) give Parent prompt oral and written notice of any breach or default by any
party to the Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing, in each case
of which Purchaser has become aware, any purported termination or repudiation
by any party of the Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing, in
each case of which Purchaser has become aware, or upon receipt of written
notice of any material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties
to the Financing Commitments or any Alternative Debt Financing and (II)
otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of Purchasers efforts
to arrange the Financing (or replacement thereof). If any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the
flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange and obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions that
are no less favorable to Purchaser (taking into account any "flex"
provisions), in the aggregate, than those set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions

 



-61-   contemplated hereby (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") no later than the
Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of fifteen
(15) consecutive Business Days after the date of this Agreement throughout
which (A) Purchaser shall have the Required Financial Information, during
which period such information shall remain compliant in all material respects
at all times with the applicable provisions of Regulation S-X and Regulation
S-K under the Securities Act, and (B) the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.1_ and _8.2 _ shall be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled
for any time during such fifteen (15) consecutive Business Day period (except
to the extent that such conditions by their nature can only be satisfied at
the Closing);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not
ended prior to August 22, 2012, the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to
have commenced prior to September 3, 2012, for any purpose hereunder;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that November 22, 2012 shall not be considered a
Business Day for purposes of the Marketing Period; and _provided_ , _further_
, that if the Marketing Period has not ended prior to December 24, 2012, the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced prior to January 2,
2013, for any purpose hereunder and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if (x) prior to the
completion of the Marketing Period, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to the Audited Financial Statements
or (y) the financial statements included in the Required Financial Information
that are available to Purchaser on the first day of the Marketing Period
would not be sufficiently current on any day during the Marketing Period to
satisfy the requirements of Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period, in which case
the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until receipt by
Purchaser of updated Required Financial Information that would be
required under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act to permit
a registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of such new fifteen (15) consecutive
Business Day period and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Marketing Period
shall end on the earlier date that is the date on which the Debt Financing is
consummated (with an understanding that, if any portion of such Debt Financing
has been funded into escrow, such portion of the Debt Financing shall not be
deemed to have been consummated until the date on which such funds have been
or will be released from escrow). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Financing
Sources_ " shall mean the entities that have directly or indirectly committed
to provide or otherwise entered into agreements in connection with the Debt
Financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and their
respective Affiliates, including the parties to the Debt Financing Commitment
and any joinder agreements or credit agreements relating thereto.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers,
employees, advisors and other representatives to, cooperate with Purchaser in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or Alternative
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser ( _provided_ _that_ such
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the operation of
the Business or Parents or its Subsidiaries other businesses), including
(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-

the Marketing Period (including drafts of such "comfort" letters with respect
to the financial statements and data referred to in the foregoing clause (A)
which such auditors are prepared to issue upon completion of customary
procedures, each in form and substance customary for high yield debt
securities offerings) (the information referred to in clauses (ii)(A) and (B),

-63-  Financing (including original copies of all certificated securities (with

or its Financing Sources, _provided_ _that_ no obligation under any such
agreement or document shall be effective until the Closing; (ix) cooperating
with the Financing Sources customary securities underwriting and secured
lending due diligence investigation, to the extent customary and reasonable;
and (x) using reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining
accountants comfort letters as reasonably requested by Purchaser, including
issuing any customary representation letters to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP;
_provided_ _that_ regardless of whether the Closing shall occur, Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the Sellers and their Affiliates
from and against any liability or obligation suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or the
Alternative Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to the Transferred Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries provided by Parent or its Affiliates in writing
specifically for use in the Financing offering documents). Purchaser shall,
regardless of whether the Closing shall occur, promptly upon Parents request,
reimburse Parent for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with such cooperation. Parent and the Sellers hereby
consent to the use of the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative
Financing; _provided_ _that_ such logos are used in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Transferred
Companies or their respective Subsidiaries.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries shall
be required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize
the execution of the Debt Financing, other than resolutions or consents of
the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries adopted at the
Closing, and (2) no obligation of any Transferred Company or Subsidiary
thereof under any certificate, document or instrument (other than the
authorization and representation letters referred to above) executed pursuant
to the foregoing shall be effective until the Closing. Nothing contained in
this _Section 5.19(b)_ or otherwise shall require Parent or any of its
Affiliates or, prior to the Closing, any Transferred Company to be an issuer
or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. If Parent at any point
believes that it has delivered the Required Financial Information in
accordance with this _Section 5.19_, it may deliver to Purchaser a written
notice to such effect, in which case Parent shall be deemed to have delivered
the Required Financial Information unless Purchaser shall provide to Parent
within five (5) Business Days a written notice describing in reasonable detail
what information that constitutes Required Financial Information Parent has
not delivered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Purchaser will be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(2)_ for any
material breach of the covenants, obligations or other agreements contained in
this _Section 5.19(b)_ only if such breach impairs or adversely affects the
Financing (including any offering of senior notes and/or senior subordinated
notes proposed by Purchaser), including the execution, timing and pricing or
cost thereof, in a material manner.

 

5.20 _Confidentiality_. For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date
(and, in the case of books and records provided or otherwise made available
under _Section 5.1(c)(i)_), a period of three (3) years following the date
such books and records are provided or otherwise made available thereunder),
Parent shall, and shall cause each other member of the Parent Group to, (a)
treat all information relating to Purchaser, the Transferred

 



-64-   Companies and their respective Subsidiaries or the Business as confidential,
preserve the confidentiality thereof, and not use or disclose to any Person
such information (except as expressly permitted by this Agreement) and (b)
cause its directors, officers, employees, representatives or other agents who
have had access to such information to keep it confidential and not to use or
disclose to any Person any such information (except as expressly permitted by
this Agreement), unless such information is (i) now or hereafter disclosed,
through no act or omission of any member of the Parent Group or any of its
directors, officers, employees, representatives or other agents, in a manner
making it publicly available, or (ii) required by Law or pursuant to the rules
and regulations promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange applicable to
listed companies to be disclosed. If the disclosure of such information is
required by Law or such rules and regulations, Parent shall cooperate with
and provide Purchaser an opportunity to object to the disclosure and shall
give Purchaser as much prior written notice as is possible under the
circumstances. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, at Purchasers
expense, to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to any such information required by Law or such rules and regulations
to be disclosed.

 

5.21 _China JV Matters_. (a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including United Technologies Far East Limited (" _UTFE_ ")) to, (i) at
Purchasers reasonable request, take all action reasonably necessary to
enforce UTFEs rights under those certain framework agreements, equity
transfer agreements and irrevocable waivers of rights, each dated May 17,
2012, with China Nanshan Development (Group) Incorporation (" _CND_ ")
(collectively, the " _China JV Buy-Out Agreements_ ") if CND is in breach of
or default under any of the China JV Buy-Out Agreements, and (ii) refrain
from amending, modifying, waiving or terminating any provision thereof (or any
provision of the joint venture contract, articles of association or other
organizational documents of the China JV Entities) without Purchasers prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed in the case of any such amendment or modification) unless such
amendment or modification would not cause the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
to incur any incremental Liability and would not otherwise adversely affect
(x) any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or (y) the ability of Parent and
the Sellers to timely consummate the Sale in any material respect.

(b) If a "Guaranteed Payment" as such term is defined in the Framework
Agreement, dated as of May 17, 2012, between UTFE and CND (the " _Framework
Agreement_ ") or other amount is owed or required to be paid by UTFE, SSAI,
SSAE, any Transferred Company or Subsidiary thereof pursuant to the Framework
Agreement or any of the other China JV Buy-Out Agreements (excluding the
FY2011 Profit Distribution (as such term is defined in the Framework
Agreement), which distribution will be paid in full by SSAI and SSAE prior to
the Closing), Parent agrees that it shall either pay or cause UTFE to pay in
full when due such Guaranteed Payment and other payments.

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, to comply with the obligations
described on _Section 5.21 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ on the terms
described therein.

 



-65-  ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

6.1 _Treatment of Business Employees_. (a) Effective as of immediately prior
to the Closing, Parent shall (or shall cause its applicable Affiliates,
including any Sellers, to) transfer the employment of each (i) employee who is
listed on _Section 6.1(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ and who, as
of immediately prior to the Closing, is employed by a member of the Parent
Group from such member to a Transferred Company or a Subsidiary of any such
Transferred Company, and (ii) employee who is listed on  _Section 6.1(a)(ii)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ and who, as of immediately prior to the
Closing, is employed by and in active service with a Transferred Company or a
Subsidiary of a Transferred Company from such Transferred Company (or a
Subsidiary of such Transferred Company) to a member of the Parent Group, as
designated by Parent or by the Sellers. With respect to each Business
Employee, Purchaser shall maintain, for the Continuation Period, the same wage
rate or cash salary and target bonus opportunity level in effect for such
employee immediately prior to the Closing and employee benefit plans and
fringe benefits that are of the same or substantially the same value, in the
aggregate, as those in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser
will also recognize each Business Employees seniority date with the
applicable Transferred Company, Subsidiary of a Transferred Company or member
of the Parent Group under its compensation and fringe benefit programs (where
such date is relevant) consistent with Purchasers treatment of Purchasers
employees generally. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be
prohibited by this _Section 6.1(a)_ from terminating the employment of any
Business Employee following the Closing Date, subject, however to Purchasers
obligations under _Section 6.3_ and _Section 6.14_, as applicable. Benefits
and compensation for employees subject to a collective bargaining Contract
shall be provided in accordance with applicable Law and/or the applicable
Contract and subsequent negotiations between Purchaser and collective
bargaining representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Continuation
Period_ " shall mean the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the later of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and December 31, 2013.

 

(b) As of and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
applicable Transferred Company or Subsidiary of a Transferred Company to,
give each Business Employee full credit for all purposes under any Transferred
Company Benefit Plans and each other employee benefit plan, policy or
arrangement, in each case maintained for the benefit of the applicable
Business Employees as of and after the Closing by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, for such Business Employees service prior to the Closing with
Parent or a Seller and their applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) and their respective
Predecessors, to the same extent such service is recognized by Parent or a
Seller and their applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries) immediately prior to the Closing, except
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
for the same period of service.

6.2 _Health Coverages_. Purchaser shall cause each Business Employee (and his
or her "eligible dependents," as defined in the Benefit Plans) to be covered
on and after the agreed upon transition period set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement by a group health plan or plans that (i) do not limit or
exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-existing condition

 



-66-   of such Business Employee or dependent (other than any limitation already in
effect under the applicable group health Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any
waiting period not in effect under the applicable group health Benefit Plan,
and (ii) provide each Business Employee full credit, for the year in which the
Closing Date occurs, for any deductible or co-payment already incurred by the
Business Employee under the applicable group health Benefit Plan and for any
other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum out-of-pocket
expense provision of the applicable group health Benefit Plan or Purchasers
group health plans.

 

6.3 _Severance_. With respect to each Business Employee (other than any
Business Employee who is a party to a Retention Letter) whose employment is
terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Transferred Company or any Subsidiary of any Transferred
Company) without Cause within the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall
provide severance benefits in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.3
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, taking into account the Business
Employees period of employment with such member of the Parent Group or its
Affiliates (including any Transferred Company or any Subsidiary of any
Transferred Company) prior to the Closing and with Purchaser or its Affiliates
on and after the Closing. For this purpose, " _Cause_ " means the applicable
Business Employees (i) conviction of a felony; (ii) commission of a willful
and material act of dishonesty involving the Business; (iii) material breach
of any fiduciary duty owed to the Business; (iv) material breach of
the policies or procedures of Purchaser and its Affiliates that causes
material harm to the Business; (v) other willful misconduct that causes
material harm to the Business; or (vi) such other conduct constituting Cause
as determined by one or more supervisory employees who were employed with the
Business immediately prior to the Closing Date.

6.4 _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in no event more than three (3) days, after the Closing Date, Parent and
the Sellers shall provide to Purchaser a list of all U.S. Business Employees
whose employment has been terminated by Parent, the Sellers or the
Transferred Companies within the ninety (90)-day period immediately prior to
Closing. Subject to Parents and the Sellers compliance with the foregoing,
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for and agrees to indemnify, hold
harmless and, at the option of Parent or the Sellers, to defend the Parent
Group from and against any Losses incurred by the Parent Group under WARN or
any similar state Law, with respect to any U.S. Business Employee who is
found to have suffered an "employment loss" under WARN on or after the Closing
Date as a result of Purchasers actions, and any and all other Losses arising
out of or resulting from Purchasers actions or Purchasers failure to serve
sufficient notice pursuant to WARN or any similar state Law.

6.5 _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser will
recognize and assume the liability with respect to accrued but unused vacation
time to the extent included as a "Current Liability" in Working Capital and
specifically reflected or reserved for on the Final Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness Statement for all Business Employees other than any Business
Employees with respect to whom a transfer of such accrued but unused vacation
time balances would require the applicable Business Employees consent and
who do not consent to such transfer (which vacation balances for such non-
consenting Business Employees shall be paid to such Business Employees by
Parent and the Sellers upon the Closing and not be included as a
"Current Liability" in Working Capital or reflected or reserved for on

 



-67-   the Final Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement). Purchaser will
advise the Parent Group as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event
more than three (3) days after the Closing Date, which Business Employees do
not consent to the transfer of their vacation balances. During the
Continuation Period, Purchaser shall allow Business Employees to use the
vacation, sick leave and personal time recognized or established
in accordance with the first two sentences of this _Section 6.5_ in
accordance with the terms of those Parent Group programs in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date. As to each Business Employee, Purchaser will credit
periods of service prior to the Closing Date for purposes of determining
accrual rates under Purchasers vacation, sick leave and personal time off
policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that accrued vacation balances will be
recognized only for those Business Employees who consent to the transfer of
accrued but unused vacation if such consent was required.

6.6 _Disability Benefits_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties shall reasonably cooperate and take such action as
is reasonably necessary to cause any U.S. Business Employee who, as of the
Closing Date, is on leave from active employment and receiving short-term or
long-term disability benefits under a Seller Benefit Plan to continue to
receive or be eligible to receive benefits under the applicable Seller Benefit
Plans (including, if necessary, transferring the employment of such employee
from a Transferred Company or a Subsidiary thereof to a member of the Parent
Group) and Parent shall cause a member of the Parent Group to be responsible
for providing short- and long-term disability benefits to any such Business
Employee until such Business Employees return to active service with the
Business. If any such Business Employee who is receiving short or long-term
disability benefits as of the Closing Date is, within the Continuation Period,
able to return to work, Parent shall promptly inform Purchaser and Purchaser
shall offer employment to such employee on terms consistent with those
applicable to Business Employees generally under this _Article VI_. The
provisions of this  _Section 6.6_ shall be subject to the terms and
requirements of any applicable collective bargaining Contract and Purchaser
will return to work any inactive employee of the Business who is subject to a
collective bargaining Contract and who is receiving short- or long-term
disability benefits as of the Closing Date, but who subsequently becomes able
to return to work within the period provided in the collective bargaining
Contract that applies to him or her.

 

6.7 _Seller Benefit Plans_.

(a) _No Assumption or Transfer of Seller Benefit Plans_. Unless specifically
provided for in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not assume any obligations
under or Liabilities with respect to, or receive any right or interest in any
trusts relating to, any assets of or any insurance, administration or other
contracts, or related obligations pertaining to, any Seller Benefit Plan and
the Sellers and Parent shall remain solely responsible for and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties for any and
all Liabilities and Losses under, in connection with or relating to any Seller
Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time established, maintained, sponsored,
administered or contributed to by the Sellers, Parent or any of their ERISA
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Company Benefit Plans), regardless of
when any such Liability or Loss arises, is incurred, is reported or is
disclosed, including any obligations for employment or other taxes and social
or national insurance contributions or similar obligations in connection

 



-68-   with any payment made or benefits provided to Business Employees (or other
employees) under the Seller Benefit Plans.

(b) _Participation in Seller Benefit Plans_. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, all Business
Employees as of the Closing Date and their eligible spouses and other
eligible dependents will cease, effective as of the Closing Date, active
participation in and any benefit accrual under each of the Seller Benefit
Plans and Parent and the Sellers shall be authorized to take all
necessary actions to effect such cessation. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence of this paragraph, Business Employees, their eligible spouses and
other eligible dependents shall continue after the Closing Date to participate
in accordance with, and subject to, their eligibility under the terms of the
applicable Seller Benefit Plans (for the avoidance of doubt, as terminated but
vested employees or eligible spouses or dependents thereof) in accordance with
the terms of such Seller Benefit Plans. 

6.8 _401(k) Plan_. Effective at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, Purchaser shall establish, and the Parent Group shall reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser to establish, participation by the U.S. Business
Employees in Purchasers tax-qualified defined contribution plan or plans with
a cash or deferred feature (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") for the benefit
of each U.S. Business Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Closing,
was eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
maintained by a Seller (collectively, the " _Seller 401(k) Plans_ "). If the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan is not established effective as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser will, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan is established, make a matching contribution with respect to each U.S.
Business Employee who participated in the Seller 401(k) Plans immediately
prior to the Closing in an amount equal to the amount that otherwise would
have been contributed in respect of such U.S. Business Employee had the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan been in effect immediately after the Closing.
Thereafter, Purchaser shall continue to make available and maintain the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan for a period ending no earlier than the last day of the
Continuation Period. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the
Seller 401(k) Plans shall, to the extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of
the Code, make cash distributions (but including promissory notes representing
participant loans) available to U.S. Business Employees, and the Purchaser
401(k) Plan shall accept any such cash distribution (but including promissory
notes representing participant loans) as a rollover distribution if so
directed by the U.S. Business Employee. The parties agree to cooperate so as
not to place any loan with respect to a U.S. Business Employees rollover
account into default during the period from the Closing Date until the
rollover is completed; _provided_ _that_ such employee continues making loan
repayments on a timely basis during such period in accordance with the Parent
Groups established procedures.

6.9 _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Effective as of the Closing Date and
through the end of the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall establish flexible
spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses for U.S. Business
Employees, and shall credit such accounts with the amount (positive or
negative) credited as of the Closing Date under comparable accounts maintained
under Benefit Plans from the beginning of the plan year to the Closing Date.
As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, (i) the Parent Group shall pay
to Purchaser in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate contributions made
by U.S. Business Employees to the Parent Groups flexible spending accounts
exceeded the aggregate benefits provided to U.S. Business Employees as of the
Closing, or (ii) Purchaser shall pay to the Parent

 



-69-   Group in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate benefits provided to
U.S. Business Employees under the Parent Groups flexible spending accounts
exceeded the aggregate contributions made by U.S. Business Employees as of
the Closing.

6.10 _Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits_. All U.S. Business Employees (and
their dependents) who retire within eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date and who immediately prior to the Closing Date were eligible for retiree
medical benefits pursuant to any applicable U.S. Seller Benefit Plan shall be
provided retiree health benefit coverage by the Seller as if the Seller has
not sold the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
prohibit Parent or Seller from amending or terminating any such U.S. Seller
Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms at any time.

6.11 _Collective Bargaining Agreements with Respect to International
Business Employees_. Purchaser agrees that as of and following the Closing
Date, to the extent required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall recognize the
unions and works councils that are signatories to the collective bargaining
Contracts and other labor agreements as the representatives of the
International Business Employees of the bargaining units described therein.

6.12  _Information Sharing; W-2 Matters_. Subject to the requirements of any
applicable Law, Parent and the Sellers shall, upon written request from
Purchaser, provide to Purchaser such information relating to the Business
Employees or the benefits and compensation from time to time provided to the
Business Employees as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to facilitate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the transaction of
any applicable human resource processes, or Purchasers compliance with its
obligations under this _Article VI_. Pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure
2004-53, Purchaser and the Sellers shall apply the "standard" method for
purposes of employee payroll reporting with respect to Business Employees.

6.13 _Transferred Company Benefit Plans_. For the avoidance of doubt, as of
the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume, or shall cause the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to continue, as the
case may be, sponsorship of, and all Liabilities and other obligations with
respect to, the Transferred Company Benefit Plans.

6.14 _Treatment of International Business Employees_. Prior to and after the
Closing Date, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to comply with and
satisfy any requirement or custom to consult with or provide information to,
with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
labor organization representing or related to International Business
Employees. In the case of International Business Employees, from and after the
Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies)
shall, in addition to meeting the applicable requirements of this  _Article
VI_ , comply in all material respects with any additional obligations or
standards arising under applicable Laws governing the terms and conditions of
their employment or severance of employment in connection with the Sale or
otherwise. In the event that either (i) Purchaser and its Affiliates, with
respect to any International Business Employee, either (A) do not provide a
mirror benefit plan that is no less favorable to the applicable International
Seller Benefit Plan in which such International Business Employee was covered
or eligible for coverage immediately prior to the Closing, or (B) amend or
otherwise modify at or after the Closing any such benefit plan or
International 

 



-70-   Transferred Company Benefit Plan or other term or condition of employment
applicable to such International Business Employee prior to the Closing or
(ii) an International Business Employee does not, for any reason, continue
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates (including a Transferred Company
or a Subsidiary of any such Transferred Company) at or after the Closing,
which, in either case, results in any obligation, contingent or otherwise, of
Seller or its Affiliates to pay any severance or other benefits (other than
any such severance or other benefits that are vested and accrued under an
International Seller Benefit Plan on or prior to Closing) to any such
International Business Employee, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, reimburse and otherwise hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
for all such severance or other benefits.

 

6.15 _Retention Letters_. Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and each member
of the Parent Group, that the Parent Group shall comply with all of their
obligations as set forth in the Retention Letters. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Parent and the Sellers shall be solely
responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser Tax Indemnified
Parties harmless for the amount of the First Retention Payments (together
with any and all withholding, employment and other Taxes and all social and
national insurance contributions and similar payments in connection with the
First Retention Payments) and Purchaser, the Transferred Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for the amount of (a) the
Second Retention Payments, (b) the Retention Letter Severance Payments, and
(c) only to the extent included as a "Current Liability" in Working Capital
and specifically reflected or reserved for on the Final Working Capital and
Net Indebtedness Statement, the Pro-Rata Bonus Payments (in each case together
with any and all withholding, employment and other Taxes and all social and
national insurance contributions and similar payments in connection
therewith). To the extent not assumed by Purchaser, the Transferred Companies
or their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to the foregoing, Parent and the
Sellers shall be solely responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the
Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties harmless for the amount of the Pro-Rata
Bonus Payments (together with any and all withholding, employment and other
Taxes and all social and national insurance contributions and similar
payments in connection therewith). For purposes hereof, " _Retention Letters_
" shall mean those certain letter agreements entered into with the Business
Employees listed on  _Section 6.15 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, which
provide for, among other things: (i) the payment of a retention bonus payable
50% upon the Closing (the " _First Retention Payment_ ") and 50% upon the one
year anniversary of the Closing or earlier in the event of certain
involuntary terminations (the " _Second Retention Payment_ "), (ii) a pro-
rated 2012 Parent bonus payable within one month of the Closing (the " _Pro-
Rata Bonus Payment_ ") and (iii) the payment of certain severance amounts in
the event the applicable Business Employees employment is terminated without
cause within one year following the Closing and Parent is not able to secure
comparable employment for such Business Employee with a member of the Parent
Group (the " _Retention Letter Severance Payments_ ").

6.16 _UK DB Plan_. Notwithstanding _Section 6.7(a)_, with respect to any
International Seller Benefit Plan subject to the Laws of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, assume any indebtedness of the employer under Section 75 of the
Pensions Act 1995 (as modified by regulations under that Act, the Pensions Act
2004 and the Occupational Pension Schemes (Employer Debt) Regulations 2005)
related to International Business Employees and former international employees
of the Business.

 



-71-  6.17 _No Plan Amendment/Third Party Beneficiary_. Without limiting the
generality of  _Section 11.5_ , nothing in this Agreement shall (a) amend, or
be deemed to amend, any Transferred Company Benefit Plan, Seller Benefit Plan
or any other employee benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, practice

ARTICLE VII 

TAX MATTERS

7.1 _Tax Indemnification by the Sellers_. Effective as of and after the
Closing Date, Parent and the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay or
cause to be paid, and shall indemnify Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date) (collectively, the " _Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties_ ")
and hold each Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against (A)
any Taxes imposed on the Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period; (B) any Taxes of Parent, the Sellers
or their respective Affiliates (other than any Transferred Company or a
Subsidiary thereof) for which any Transferred Company or a Subsidiary thereof
is liable under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or under any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law), as transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise, in each case with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or
by reason of being a member of a consolidated, affiliated, combined or other
group for Tax purposes at any time before the Closing; (C) any Taxes arising
out of or relating to any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty contained in _Section 3.13(h)_, _(j)_ , _(k)_ , _(l)_ , and _(m)_
or breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or the Sellers contained in
this Agreement; (D) any Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) imposed on any
Seller or any Transferred Company or any Subsidiary thereof (or Purchaser as a
method of collecting such Taxes) with respect to the sale of the Shares
pursuant to this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes
imposed with respect to the deemed asset sale as result of the Section
338(h)(10) Elections); (E) any Taxes imposed with respect to the transactions
contemplated by _Sections 5.7_ and _5.17_ hereof; (F) Transfer Taxes for
which Parent and the Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 7.11_; and
(G) reasonable legal and other professional advisor fees and expenses

_however_ , that the Sellers shall not be required to pay or cause to be paid,
or to indemnify or hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Tax Parties from
and against (x) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were included as a
"Current Liability" in Working Capital on the Final Working Capital and Net
Indebtedness Statement, after reducing such liability by any amounts paid to
Parent in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section 7.5(d)_ or (y) any Taxes for
which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section 7.2_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event any Taxes for which
Parent and Sellers otherwise would be responsible pursuant to this _Section
7.1_ are set-off or otherwise reduced by the utilization of any loss,
deduction or credit attributable to a Post-Closing Period (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any such Tax attribute of a Transferred
Company or any Subsidiary thereof as of the close of business on the Closing
Date), Parent and the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay or cause to be
paid, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Tax Indemnified

 



-72-   Parties from and against any Taxes imposed with respect to subsequent
taxable periods to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed in such
subsequent taxable periods but for the prior utilization of such loss,
deduction or credit.

7.2 _Tax Indemnification by Purchaser_. Effective as of and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify the Parent
Group (collectively, the " _Seller Tax Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each
Seller Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against (A) any Taxes imposed
on the Transferred Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any
Post-Closing Period (other than such Taxes that are described in _Section
7.1(B)_ through _(E)_ or in the last sentence of  _Section 7.1_); (B) any
Taxes arising from any action or transaction undertaken by Purchaser, the
Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary
course of business on the Closing Date after the Closing (other than any
action or transaction taken pursuant to _Sections 5.7_ or _5.17_ or at the
direction of Parent); (C) any Taxes arising out of or relating to any breach
of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (D)

attributable to any item described in clauses (A) to (D). 

7.3 _Straddle Periods_. To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law,
the taxable year of each of the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries that includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on
(and including) the Closing Date. To the extent not permitted or required by
applicable Law, for purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle
Period, (i) Property Taxes of the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount
of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the
Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii)
Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Transferred Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed
as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date;
_provided_ _that_  exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated
on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period.

7.4 _Tax Returns_. (a) Parent shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared (i)
any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes any member of
the Parent Group, on the one hand, and any of the Transferred Companies or
their respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand (a " _Combined Tax Return_
"), and (ii) any Tax Return (other than any Combined Tax Return) that is
required to be filed by or with respect to any of the Transferred Companies or
their respective Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or before
the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return_ "). Parent shall
timely file or cause to be timely filed any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return
that is required to be filed on or before the Closing Date (taking into
account any valid extensions). Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,
to Purchaser all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date at least thirty (30) days (or such shorter
period as is reasonable taking into account the Tax period of the respective
Tax Return or other relevant circumstances) prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (taking into account any valid extensions) for Purchasers
review and comment, and

 



-73-   Parent shall consider in good faith any written comments to such Pre-Closing
Separate Tax Returns received from Purchaser reasonably in advance of such due
date for filing such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed such Tax Returns. Except as otherwise required by Law, all Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practices of the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or permitted by this
Agreement, Purchaser shall not amend or revoke any Combined Tax Return or any
Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns (or any notification or election
relating thereto) without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. At Parents
reasonable request, Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, amended Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Returns. Purchaser shall promptly provide (or cause to
be provided) to Parent any information reasonably requested by Parent to
facilitate the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns described in this
_Section 7.4(a)_ and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare (or cause to be prepared) such information in a manner and on a
timeline requested by Parent, which information and timeline shall be
consistent with the past practice of the Transferred Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries with respect to any Straddle Period (other than
any Combined Tax Returns) (each, a " _Straddle Period Separate Tax Return_ ").
Except as otherwise required by Law, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be
prepared such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
past practices of the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries.
Purchaser shall deliver to Parent for its review and comment a copy of such
Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days (or such
shorter period as is reasonable taking into account the Tax period of the
respective Tax Return or other relevant circumstances) prior to the due date
thereof (taking into account any valid extensions) and Purchaser shall (x)
make such revisions to such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return as are
reasonably requested by Parent to the extent such revisions relate to the
Pre-Closing Period or to the extent such revisions relate to the past practice
of the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, and (y)
consider in good faith any written comments to such Straddle Period
Separate Tax Return to the extent such comments relate to the Post-Closing
Period and are received from Parent reasonably in advance of such due date for
filing such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns. Purchaser shall not amend or
revoke any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns (or any notification or
election relating thereto) without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At
Parents reasonable request and at Parents expense, Purchaser shall file, or
cause to be filed, amended Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parents request shall be deemed unreasonable if such amended
Straddle Period Separate Tax Return would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Sellers shall be required to provide any Person with any Tax
Return or copy of any Tax Return of (i) Parent or a member of the Parent Group
or (ii) a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes any member of
the Parent Group (including any Combined Tax Return).

 



-74-  7.5 _Certain Tax Benefits, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_. (a) If, during
the period ending on the four (4) year anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) derives a Tax Benefit
as a result of any audit adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax
Proceeding) made with respect to any Tax Item by any taxing authority with
respect to Taxes for which Parent and the Sellers are responsible under
_Section 7.1_, then Purchaser shall pay to Parent the amount of such Tax
Benefit (net of any corresponding Taxes (i) payable with respect to a Post-
Closing Period as a result of such audit adjustment (or adjustment in any
other Tax Proceeding) or (ii) payable with respect to the receipt or accrual
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any such Tax Benefit) within fifteen
(15) days of filing the Tax Return in which such Tax Benefit is actually
realized or utilized.

 

(b) Parent shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of any Taxes for which
Parent and the Sellers are responsible for under  _Section 7.1_ and any
refunds or credits to which Parent is entitled under _Section 7.5(a)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to any such refunds
or credits (i) if and to the extent such refunds or credits were included as
"Current Assets" in determining Working Capital and reflected or reserved for
on the Final Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement or (ii) arising
from the carryback of any loss generated in any Post-Closing Period.
Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes of the
Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries other than refunds or
credits to which Parent is entitled to pursuant to the foregoing
sentence. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Transferred Companies or
their respective Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Parent and Purchaser in accordance with the principles set
forth in _Section 7.3_. Each party shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to
pay, to the party entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes under this _Section
7.5(b)_, the amount of such refund or credit (including any interest paid
thereon by a Governmental Entity and net of any Taxes imposed on the party
receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or accrual of such
refund or credit and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with
obtaining such refund or credit) in readily available funds within fifteen
(15) days of the actual receipt of the refund or, in the case of a credit, the
filing of the Tax Return actually applying such credit against amounts
otherwise payable.

 

(c) Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries to carry forward, where permitted by applicable Law, any item of
loss, deduction or credit which arises in any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date into any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date.

(d) On the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide
to Parent a schedule setting forth a reconciliation of (i) the amounts
included in respect of Taxes as "Current Liabilities" (and "Current Assets")
in the determination of the amount of Working Capital on the Final Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness Statement and (ii) the amount of Taxes actually
paid (and refunds actually received) by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries) to a Governmental Entity within such 2-year period in respect of
the liabilities described in clause (i). If the amount described in clause
(i) exceeds the amount described in clause (ii), Purchaser shall promptly pay
Parent an amount in cash equal to such excess; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 7.5(d)_ shall relieve Parent and the Sellers from
any obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties under
_Section 7.1_. Any dispute regarding the schedule required to be

 



-75-   prepared by Purchaser or the amount payable, if any, by Purchaser pursuant
to this _Section 7.5(d)_ shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting
Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Sellers on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other
hand.

 

7.6 _Tax Contests_. From and after Closing:

(a) If any Governmental Entity commences a Tax Proceeding of or with respect
to any of the Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries (x) that,
if pursued successfully by the applicable Governmental Entity, would
reasonably be expected to serve as the basis for a claim for indemnification
under _Article VII_ or (y) for any Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle Period,
then the party to this Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax
Proceeding promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the other party or
parties to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such
party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of any of
its obligations under this _Article VII_ , except to the extent that the other
party is prejudiced by such failure. In the case of any such Tax Proceeding
described in clause (x) of this _Section 7.6(a)_, such notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the basis for such claim for indemnification under
_Article VII_ and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the Governmental Entity.

 

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the
Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date (other than a Tax Proceeding described in
_Section 7.6(d)_), Parent shall have the exclusive right to control the
defense of such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) if the
resolution of such Tax Proceeding could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse impact on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any
Transferred Company or any Subsidiary thereof after the Closing) in any Post-
Closing Period, Parent promptly shall provide written notice of such Tax
Proceeding to Purchaser and promptly shall respond to any reasonable requests
from Purchaser for information relating to such Tax Proceeding, and (y) Parent
shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such settlement, compromise
or abandonment could have a material adverse impact on Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries) in any Post-Closing Period.

(c) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the
Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period
(other than a Tax Proceeding described in  _Section 7.6(d)_), the
Controlling Party shall have the right and obligation to control the defense,
at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party and offer the
Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iv)
the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good
faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (v) the Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to attend 

 



-76-   any meetings or conferences with the relevant Governmental Entity with
respect to such Tax Proceeding, and (vi) the Controlling Party shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Controlling Party_ " shall mean Parent if Parent and its Affiliates are
reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, or Purchaser if Purchaser and its Affiliates are reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax
Proceeding; and " _Non-Controlling Party_ " means whichever of the Parent or
Purchaser is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding
with respect to (i) any Tax Return of Parent or a member of the Parent Group;
and (ii) any Tax Return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that
includes any member of the Parent Group (including any Combined Tax Return);
_provided_ _that_ , if the resolution of such Tax Proceeding could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse impact on Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including any Transferred Company or any Subsidiary thereof after
the Closing) in any Post-Closing Period, Parent promptly shall provide written
notice of such Tax Proceeding to Purchaser and promptly shall respond to any
reasonable requests from Purchaser inquiring as to the status of such
Tax Proceeding.

7.7 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Not more than sixty (60) days after the receipt of a request from Parent,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to Parent a
package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers,
reasonably requested by Parent to enable Parent to prepare and file all Tax
Returns required to be prepared and filed by it with respect to
the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall
prepare such package completely and accurately, in good faith and in a manner
consistent with Parents past practice.

 

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other party to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation
and information as either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability
for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this _Article VII_ or a right to
refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing necessary powers of attorney, copies of
all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all
relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work
papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
taxing authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis
of property and other information, which any such party may possess. Each
party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or information so
provided.

 

(c) Each party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and
all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries for their respective
Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing

 



-77-   Date until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations for
the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents relate, or (ii)
eight (8) years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax
Returns. Thereafter, the party holding such Tax Returns or other documents may
dispose of them after offering the other party reasonable notice and
opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other documents at
such other partys own expense.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, access to and
the retention of all Tax Returns and other documents and records relating to
Tax matters with respect to the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries shall be governed by this _Article VII_ and the provisions of 
_Article V_ shall not apply.

7.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. To the extent relating to the Transferred
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, Parent shall terminate or cause
to be terminated, on or before the Closing Date, all Tax sharing or other
similar agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to
which any of the Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, including any member of the
Parent Group, on the other hand, are parties, and neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates nor any of the Transferred Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries shall have any rights or obligations thereunder after the
Closing.

7.9 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise required
under applicable Tax Law, Parent, Purchaser, the Transferred Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall treat any
and all payments under this  _Article VII_, _Section 2.7_, _Section
5.7(b)_, _Section 5.17(b)_, and _Article X_ as an adjustment to the purchase
price for Tax purposes. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith to
structure any indemnification payment hereunder in a manner that minimizes
any Taxes imposed on the payment or receipt of such indemnification payment.

7.10 _Section 338 Elections_. Purchaser shall not make, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries) not to make, (a) any election under Section 338 of the Code (or
any comparable election under state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the
acquisition of any Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of Parent (which Parent may grant or withhold in its
sole and absolute discretion), or (b) any election with respect to any
Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any election
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3), which election would be
effective on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
Purchaser and Parent shall jointly make and file an election under Section
338(h)(10) (and any comparable elections under state, local or foreign Law)
with respect to each U.S. Company (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_ ") and
(y) Purchaser shall make, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) to make an
election under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any comparable election under
state or local law) with respect to each eligible Foreign Transferred Company
(other than the Specified Chinese Entities) (the " _Section 338(g) Elections_
"). 

7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any sales, use, transfer, documentary, stamp, recording, value
added or similar Taxes

 



-78-   and related fees imposed on or payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any
capital gain Taxes and withholding Taxes imposed on the Sale, which shall be
borne by Parent and the Sellers) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Parent and the Sellers, on the one hand, and fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser, on the other hand. The party responsible under applicable
Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall
prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such
Tax Return to the other party. Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause

Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim
for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer
Taxes.

7.12 _Timing of Payments_. Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant
to this _Article VII_  shall be made within ten (10) days after the

case earlier than five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
or other amounts are required to be paid to the applicable Governmental
Entity.

7.13 _Tax Matters Coordination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, indemnification with respect to Taxes and the procedures
relating thereto shall be governed exclusively by this _Article VII_ and
_Section 5.17(b)_ and the provisions of _Article X_ (other than  _Sections
10.1 _and _10.6_ ) shall not apply.

7.14 _Covenant With Respect to Specific Chinese Entities_. (a) Purchaser
shall timely file on IRS Form 8832 an election pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3(c) (such an election, a " _Check-the-Box Election_ "),
effective one day following the Closing Date, to treat Hamilton Sundstrand
Singapore Industrial Pte. Ltd. (" _HS Singapore_ ") as an entity disregarded
from its direct owner. Purchaser shall timely file a Check-the-Box Election,
effective two days following the Closing Date, to treat each of Suzhou
Sullair Air Equipment Co. Ltd., Shezhen Sullair Asia Industrial Co. Ltd.,
Sundyne Industrial Equipment (Tianjin) Co. Ltd., and Hamilton-Sundstrand
Industrial (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. (each, a " _Specified Chinese Entity_ ,"
and collectively, the " _Specified Chinese Entities_ ") as an entity
disregarded from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the
avoidance of doubt, such owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be a
newly formed entity (and not a Transferred Company or a Subsidiary thereof)
that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the "
_Specified Owner_ ") and the Specified Owner shall own for U.S. federal income
tax purposes all of the equity interests in the Specified Chinese Entities
from the Closing until the date that is two (2) days following the Closing
Date. During the time period beginning immediately following the Closing and
ending at the time the Check-the Box Elections for the Specified Chinese
Entities become effective, Purchaser shall not take or permit to be taken any
action or transaction by or with respect to the Specified Chinese Entities
outside of the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
other than actions or transactions expressly contemplated by the China JV Buy-
Out Agreements.

(b) The Parties intend that the Check-the-Box Elections described in _Section
7.14(a)_ be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as tax-free
liquidations pursuant to Sections 332 and 337 of the Code. Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the

 



-79-   Specified Chinese Entities), not to take any action that could reasonably be
expected to cause such Check-the-Box Elections to fail to qualify for such tax
treatment.

Closing:

 



-81-  (a) by mutual written consent of Parent, the Sellers and Purchaser;

 

(b) by either Parent and the Sellers or by Purchaser, if:

 

(1) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2012 (the "
_Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the conditions to
Closing, other than the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section
8.2(d)_, shall have been satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied on
such date, the Outside Date may be extended by either Parent or Purchaser
from time to time by written notice to the other party up to a date not beyond
an additional ninety (90) days, the latest of any of which dates shall
thereafter be deemed to be the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)(1)_ shall
not be available to any party to this Agreement whose failure or whose
Affiliates failure to perform any material covenant or obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or before such date;

 

(2) if Parent or the Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of
its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to perform (i) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section 8.2(a)_,
_8.2(b)_ , _8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ , as applicable, and (ii) (A) cannot be cured
prior to the Outside Date or (B) has not been cured prior to the date that is
thirty (30) days from the date that Purchaser or Parent and the Sellers, as
applicable, is notified by the other of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(b)(2)_ shall not be available to any party to this Agreement if
such party shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect
any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_,
_8.2(b)_ , _8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ , as applicable;

 

(3) if any Order issued by a Governmental Entity in a Primary Jurisdiction
permanently restrains, enjoins or prohibits or makes illegal the consummation
of the Sale, and such Order becomes effective (and final and nonappealable)
(except for Orders relating to Competition Laws described in _Section
9.1(b)(4)_, which shall be governed by  _Section 9.1(b)(4)_); or

(4) if any Governmental Entity that must grant a permit,
authorization, consent, approval, expiration or termination required by
_Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.2(d)_ shall have denied such grant and such
denial shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(b)(4)_ shall have used its reasonable best efforts to obtain such permit,
authorization, consent, approval, expiration or termination to the extent
required by  _Section 5.3_;

 



-82-  (c) by Parent and the Sellers, (i) if all of the conditions set forth in 
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ are satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but
such conditions must be capable of being satisfied on such date), (ii)
Purchaser fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within three (3) Business Days following the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and (iii) Parent and the Sellers stood
ready, willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on that date, which shall be evidenced by a written notice delivered
by Parent and the Sellers to Purchaser to that effect; _provided_   _that_
during such three (3) Business Day-period following the date the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, no party shall be entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(1)_; or

(d) by Purchaser if Parent has not executed and delivered to Purchaser the
Acceptance Notice within five (5) Business Days following completion of the
Consultation Process.

the other hand, pursuant to _Section 9.1_, written notice of such termination
shall be given by the terminating party to the other party to this Agreement.

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Parent and the Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on
the other hand, pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall terminate and
become void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of
any party to this Agreement, except as set forth in, and subject to the terms
of, the Guarantees, the indemnification and reimbursement provisions of
_Section 5.19(b)_ (Cooperating with Financing), _Section 9.4_ (Reverse
Termination Fee), _Section 9.5_ (Termination Fee) and _Section 11.6_
(Expenses); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve either party hereto from liability for failure to perform the
obligations set forth in  _Section 5.2_ (Confidentiality), (ii) nothing in
this Agreement shall relieve Parent or the Sellers from liability for any
willful and intentional breach of this Agreement and (iii) subject to _Section
9.4(b)_ and  _Section 9.4(c)_ (including the limitation on liability set
forth therein) in the case of Purchaser, the termination of this Agreement
under circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is not payable
pursuant to  _Section 9.4(a)_ shall not relieve Purchaser for liability for
any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement. All of (x) the
provisions of _Section 5.2_ (Confidentiality), _Section 5.6_
(Public Announcements), this _Section 9.3_ (Effect of Termination), _Section
9.4_ (Reverse Termination Fee), _Section 9.5_ (Termination Fee) and _Article
XI_ (General Provisions), (y) the obligations of Parent and Purchaser to each
pay one-half of any filing fees to any Governmental Entity pursuant to
_Section 5.3(f)_ (Efforts) in respect of filings made prior to the
termination of this Agreement, and (z) the indemnification and reimbursement
provisions of _Section 5.19(b)_ (Financing) shall survive any termination of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and intentional
breach" shall mean a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act, which act
or deliberate failure to act constitutes in and of itself a material breach of
this Agreement which was undertaken with the knowledge (actual or
constructive) that such act or failure to act would be, or would reasonably be
expected to cause, a material breach of this Agreement.

 



-83-  9.4 _Reverse Termination Fee_. (a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent
and the Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(2)_ (in the event of a breach or
failure to perform by Purchaser) or _Section 9.1(c)_ (failure to close), then
Purchaser shall pay to Parent an amount (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ")
equal to $223,600,000 within two (2) Business Days of the date of such
termination (it being understood that in no event shall Purchaser be required
to pay the Reverse Termination Fee more than once). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the second sentence of
_Section 9.4(d)_ and Purchasers payment obligations under clause (y) of
_Section 9.3_ (the " _Regulatory Fee Payment Obligations_ "), (i) Parents
receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee from Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 9.4(a)_ (including its rights to enforce the Guarantees with respect
thereto), any reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 5.19(b)_ (such reimbursement and indemnification
obligations pursuant to _Section 5.19(b)_, the " _Purchaser Financing
Cooperation Payment Obligations_ ") and Parents right to seek specific
performance of this Agreement by Purchaser prior to termination of this
Agreement, as provided for and subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 11.11_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and
the Sellers against the Purchaser Related Parties for any Loss relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Guarantees, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any breach of this Agreement by
Purchaser, the termination of this Agreement or the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, in any circumstance in which
Parent is entitled to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.4(a)_, and, upon payment of such amounts, none of the Purchaser
Related Parties shall have any Liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Guarantees, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out
of any such breach, termination or failure.

(b) In connection with any Loss suffered as a result of any willful and
intentional breach of this Agreement by Purchaser, other than in a
circumstance in which Parent is entitled to receive the Reverse Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_, Parent and the Sellers agree that the
maximum aggregate Liability of Purchaser shall be limited to an amount equal
to the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee, the Regulatory Fee Payment
Obligations and the Purchaser Financing Cooperation Payment Obligations, and
in no event shall Parent and the Sellers be entitled to seek or obtain any
recovery or judgment in excess of such amount.

(c) In no event shall Parent or the Sellers be entitled to seek or obtain any
recovery or judgment against any of the Purchaser Related Parties or any of
their respective assets in excess of (i) the amount of the Reverse Termination
Fee (plus, in the case the Reverse Termination Fee is due and payable and is
not timely paid, the amounts described in the second sentence of _Section
9.4(d)_), (ii) the Purchaser Financing Cooperation Payment Obligations and
(iii) the Regulatory Fee Payment Obligations, and, except as provided in
_Section 9.4(b)_, in no event shall Parent or the Sellers be entitled to seek
or obtain any other damages of any kind against any Purchaser Related Party
for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Guarantees or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by Purchaser), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure; _provided_ , _however_
, this _Section 9.4(c)_ shall not limit the right of the parties hereto to
seek specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to, and subject to the
limitations in, _Section 11.11_ prior to the termination of this Agreement;
and _provided_ , _further_ , in

 



-84-   no event will Parent and the Sellers be entitled to both (x) the payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee and (y) the grant of specific performance of this
Agreement pursuant to, and subject to the limitations in, _Section 11.11_,
which grant results in the consummation of the Closing as contemplated by this
Agreement. In light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages
with respect to the foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement in
any circumstance in which the Reverse Termination Fee is payable, the payment
of (A) the Reverse Termination Fee (plus, in the case the Reverse Termination
Fee is not timely paid, the amounts described in the second sentence of
_Section 9.4(d)_) pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_, constitutes a reasonable
estimate of the monetary damages that will be suffered by Parent and the
Sellers by reason of breach or termination of this Agreement or the
Guarantees, (B) the Purchaser Financing Cooperation Payment Obligations, and
(C) the Regulatory Fee Payment Obligations, if applicable, shall be in full
and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary damages of Parent and the
Sellers arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Guarantees, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by
Purchaser), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure;
_provided_ , _however_ , this _Section 9.4_ shall not limit the right of
the parties hereto to seek specific performance of this Agreement pursuant
to, and subject to the limitations in, _Section 11.11_ prior to the
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent and the Sellers (and their respective stockholders,
partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives
and agents) hereby waive any and all rights and claims against any Purchaser
Related Party (other than (I) Purchaser and (II) the Guarantors solely with
respect to their respective obligations under the Guarantees) in connection
with this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment, whether at Law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not in any way limit or restrict Parents and the Sellers
right to seek specific performance as set forth in _Section 11.11_ (subject
to the limitations set forth therein) prior to any valid termination of this
Agreement.

(d) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section
9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails promptly to pay the
amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_, and, in order to obtain such
payments, Parent or the Sellers commence a suit that results in a judgment
against Purchaser for the amounts set forth in _Section 9.4(a)_ or any
portion thereof, Purchaser will pay to Parent, from the date such payment was
required to be made under this Agreement, the Interest Rate on the amounts set
forth in this _Section 9.4_. The parties acknowledge that the Reverse
Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Sellers in the
circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Sale, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision.

 

9.5 _Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)_ (failure to deliver the Acceptance Notice), then Parent
shall pay to Purchaser an amount (the " _Termination Fee_ ") equal to
$223,600,000 within two (2) Business Days of the date

 



-85-   of such termination (it being understood that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Termination Fee more than once).

 

9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, either Parent or a
Seller or Purchaser may (a) extend the time for performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Person, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party granting such extension or waiver.

-88-  10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) A Person that may be entitled to
be indemnified under this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), shall
promptly notify the party or parties liable for such indemnification (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any pending or threatened claim
or demand asserted by a third party that the Indemnified Party has determined
has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under such agreement (such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_
"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect
to the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this _Article X_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that notices
for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement must describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the alleged breach and be delivered prior to the expiration of any
applicable survival period specified in _Section 10.1_ for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3(a)_, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party
Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ _that_ the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 10.4(b)_, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense, but
the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of
recognized standing and competence and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim. Purchaser or
Parent and the Sellers, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of
their Affiliates and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by
furnishing non-privileged books and records, personnel and witnesses, as
appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense and control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim, in its reasonable discretion without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _that_ (x) such settlement or
judgment does not involve any injunctive relief or finding or admission of
any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party
and (y) the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts
in such settlement or judgment, (ii) not encumber any of the assets of any
Indemnified Party or agree to any term, restriction or condition that would
apply to or adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any
Indemnified Partys business and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any
settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of any
Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third Party Claim. No
Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

 



-89-  (c) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ and the
Indemnified Party is entitled to recover all or a part of such Losses from a
third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on facts, events and
circumstances giving rise to the right of indemnification, the Indemnified
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except with respect to, (i) the Ancillary
Agreements (other than the Foreign Acquisition Agreements), (ii) the matters
covered by _Sections 2.5_ ,  _2.6_ , _2.7_ and _2.9_ , (iii) _Section
11.11_ and (iv) any matter relating to Taxes (which shall be governed
exclusively by _Article VII_ and _Section 5.17(b)_), Purchaser, Parent and
the Sellers acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of Parent and the Sellers and Purchaser, respectively, for
any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) (but
excluding claims for fraud) that each party may at any time suffer or incur,
or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with the Sale,
including any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by
any party, or any failure by any party to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied
with, under this Agreement and the Foreign Acquisition Agreements. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which
they may become entitled.

10.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses shall be
net of (i) any third-party insurance and indemnity proceeds that have been
recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise
to the right of indemnification, _less_ the amount of out-of-pocket costs
incurred to obtain such proceeds (it being agreed that if third-party
insurance or indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered
by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds, _less_ the amount of out-of-pocket costs incurred
to obtain such proceeds, shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and (ii) any Net Tax
Benefits. The Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and
indemnity provisions covering such Loss to the same extent as it would if such
Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. Upon making any payment to
the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article
X_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have under any third-
party insurance policies with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent
permitted under such insurance policies, assign any such rights to the
Indemnifying Party. From and after the Closing Date, no member of the Parent
Group shall have any right of contribution or indemnification against any of
the Transferred Companies or their respective Subsidiaries for any amounts
paid to any Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of any claim for
indemnification under this Agreement or any claim arising from or relating to
a breach by Parent, Sellers or, prior to the Closing, any of the Transferred
Companies or their respective Subsidiaries of any

 



-90-   representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement.

10.7 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party have
liability to any Indemnified Party for any consequential, special, incidental
(other than arising by reason of or resulting from efforts to mitigate
Losses), indirect or punitive damages, except for any such damages to the
extent paid to a third party, including a Governmental Entity.

10.8 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
such item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule

and the Ancillary Agreements; (x) Parent, the Sellers and Purchaser have each
participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation should
arise, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be construed as if

to the contrary, any payment obligation of Purchaser hereunder shall be a
joint and several obligation of Purchaser and the Transferred Companies and
the Subsidiaries of the Transferred Companies. Whether or not the Closing

including any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, shall be deemed to be disclosed for other Sections and
schedules of this Agreement, including any Section of the Seller Disclosure

such disclosure would be reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each
Transferred Company that is also a Seller shall be treated as a Transferred
Company (and not as a Seller) for purposes of the post-Closing covenants and
agreements contained herein and otherwise where the context so requires. 

11.2 _Headings; Definitions_. The section and article headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

11.3 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) This

by Law, that final and unappealable judgment against any of them in any Action
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other

relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this

State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

11.8 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , _ however_ , that no party to this
Agreement may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of each other party to this Agreement, except
that (i) Parent may assign its rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of
Parent, (ii) prior to the Closing, Purchaser may assign its rights under this
Agreement to one or more Affiliates of Purchaser, and (iii) Purchaser may
collaterally assign this Agreement to any Financing Source or any other party
providing bona fide debt financing to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ _that_ , in each case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii),
any such assignment shall not impede or delay in any respect the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relieve Parent or
Purchaser of its Liabilities or obligations hereunder. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this  _Section 11.8_ shall be void.

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought.
Either party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by the other parties to this Agreement with any term or provision
of this Agreement on the part of such other parties to this Agreement to be
performed or complied with. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of a
breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach.

 



-95-  11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend
that the remedies and limitations set forth in this Agreement (including
_Section 9.3_, _Section 9.4_, the last sentence of _Section 11.3(b)_,
the first, second, third and fourth sentences of _Section 11.3(c)_, _Section
11.5_ and _Section 11.11_) shall be construed as an integral provision of
this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable
in any manner that increases (i) the Liability of any party (or the Liability
of any Purchaser Related Party) or (ii) the obligations hereunder or under the
Guarantees.

 

11.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement or any Foreign Acquisition Agreement
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Foreign Acquisition Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and thereof, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity.
Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, it is explicitly agreed
that Parent and the Sellers shall not be entitled to seek or obtain any
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief requiring Purchaser
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, except that Parent and the Sellers
may seek specific performance of Purchasers obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Purchase Price and of Purchasers
obligation to consummate the Closing if and only in the event that (i) all
conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ have been satisfied in full
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but
for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing
(or, if Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with _Section
5.19(a)_, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or
will be funded (or, if such Debt Financing has been funded into escrow, such
funds have been or will be released from escrow) at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) Parent and the Sellers have
irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing pursuant to
_Article II_ will occur. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that Parent and the Sellers
shall be entitled to specific performance to enforce  _Section 5.19_.
Subject to the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
permitted by this Agreement on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in

 



-96-   accordance with this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the limitations on remedies of the parties
following termination of this Agreement set forth in _Section 9.4_ shall not
limit the right of Parent or the Sellers to obtain specific performance
pursuant to, and subject to the limitations of, this  _Section 11.11_.

11.12 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by Parent or
any of its respective Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding by or on behalf
of a third party, that such third party is or is not in breach or violation
of, or in default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions
of any contract.

 

11.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
other electronic method shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]

 



-97-  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed by or on behalf of each of
the parties as of the day first above written.

_For the attention of Charles D. Gill_

Paris, on July 25, 2012

_STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL_

Dear Mr. Gill:

 

Following our recent discussions in relation to the contemplated acquisition
of all of the capital stock or other equity interests of each company
listed on _Schedule 1_ hereto (each, a " _Company_ " and, collectively, the "
_Companies_ ") and owned by United Technologies Corporation (the " _Seller_ ")
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, we hereby make the following final,
irrevocable and binding offer (the " _Offer_ "), which the Seller may in its
sole discretion elect to accept in accordance with the procedures described
below, and whereby the undersigned (the " _Purchaser_ ", " _we_ " and " _us_
") agrees, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the " _Global Purchase Agreement_
"), dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Seller, the Purchaser and
the other parties thereto attached hereto as _Schedule 2_ , to acquire the
capital stock and other equity interests of each of the Companies owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Seller, as set forth opposite each Companys
name in Section 3.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _French Shares_
"), from the Seller and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries for an aggregate
purchase price equal to $464,800,000 (the " _Transaction_ ").

Capitalized terms used in this letter (this " _Letter_ ") shall,
unless otherwise defined herein, have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Global Purchase Agreement.

 



\- 1 -  ---|--- 



   (a) | If the Seller wishes to accept our Offer, the Seller shall notify
the Purchaser of such acceptance through the delivery, on or prior to the
Expiry Date (as such term is defined below in Clause 2(a)), of written notice
in the form attached hereto as _Schedule 3_ (an " _Acceptance Notice_ ")
specifying that the Seller accepts the Offer and that the Global Purchase
Agreement shall become effective as to the French Shares (the date of
delivery of such written notice, the " _Acceptance Date_ "). 
---|--- 



   (b) | We hereby irrevocably undertake not to withdraw, revoke, modify
or qualify our Offer in any respect whatsoever prior to the Expiry Date. 
---|--- 
 



   2. | DURATION OF THE OFFER 
---|--- 



   (a) | Our Offer will enter into force on the date of countersignature
of this Letter by the Seller and will remain valid until the earlier of: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | 5:00 p.m., Paris time, on the fifth Business Day after the
date on which the final written opinion regarding the Transaction has been
received from the works council ( _Comit e dentreprise_) of each Company
(each, a " _Works  Council_" and, collectively, the " _Works  Councils_");
and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the date of termination of the Global Purchase Agreement,
if terminated prior to the Closing in accordance with its terms, 
---|---|--- 
 

(as such date may be extended by agreement between the Seller and the
Purchaser, the " _Expiry Date_ ").

 



   (b) | If the Offer has not been accepted by the Seller prior to the
Expiry Date in compliance with the provisions hereof, the Offer will
automatically terminate as at the Expiry Date, unless the parties mutually
agree to postpone such Expiry Date to a later date. 
---|--- 



   3. | INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION OF THE WORKS COUNCILS 
---|--- 



   (a) | The Seller undertakes to ensure that the process of informing and
consulting with each Works Council will be completed as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof. The Seller further undertakes to keep us
regularly informed of the status of such information and consultation process
and to immediately provide us with a true and certified copy of the final
opinion delivered by each Works Council. 
---|--- 



   (b) | The Purchaser agrees to cooperate, as may be required, with the
Seller and the Companies, including (subject to applicable confidentiality
obligations and other legal constraints) by providing any documents and
information relating to the Purchaser that may be reasonably requested by any
Works Council in connection with the consultation process, to the extent such
documents and information are reasonably available. Purchaser acknowledges
that representatives of Purchaser and its Affiliates may be invited to attend
or otherwise participate in proceedings of the Works Councils and, if so
requested, will consider such participation in good faith.  
---|--- 
 



\- 2 -  efforts to refrain from, and to procure that their respective Subsidiaries
refrain from, doing anything that is reasonably likely to prejudice the
expeditious completion of the consultation process and delivery of the opinion
of each Works Council. 
---|--- 



   4. | EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD 
---|--- 



   (a) | Except as contemplated by the Dijon Agreements, as from the date
hereof and until the earliest of (i) the Acceptance Date, (ii) the termination
of the Global Purchase Agreement and (iii) the Closing under the Global
Purchase Agreement, the Seller shall not, and shall procure that no Affiliate
of the Seller shall, directly or indirectly, including through their advisors,
initiate or engage in any discussions or negotiations, or enter into any
contract, with any Person other the Purchaser, or intentionally solicit or
encourage any Person, to acquire all or part of the share capital of any
Company or any Subsidiaries thereof and/or all or part of the assets of such
entities, or to proceed with the merger, spin-off, contribution, business
combination, recapitalization, or any similar transaction involving any
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 
---|--- 
 



   5. | GOVERNING LAW 
---|--- 



   (a) | This Letter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed and to be
performed wholly within such State and without reference to the choice-of-law
principles that would result in the application of the Laws of a different
jurisdiction. 
---|--- 



   (b) | Each party to this Letter irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the State of New York in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Letter, and hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined
in such New York state or federal court. Each party to this Letter hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action. The
parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that final and
unappealable judgment against any of them in any Action contemplated above
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or
outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Offer Letter.

The Seller hereby provides notice to the Purchaser of the Sellers agreement
to accept the Offer and proceed with the Transaction on the terms and
conditions set out in the Global Purchase Agreement. This Notice constitutes
the Acceptance Notice from the Seller to the Purchaser for the purposes of
the Offer Letter. Upon delivery of this Notice: (i) Article III of the Global
Purchase Agreement, pursuant to Section 2.10(b) thereof, becomes effective
with respect to the French Shares, (ii) the French Shares are included in
the Shares (as defined in the Global Purchase Agreement) for all purposes
under the Global Purchase Agreement, and (iii) the Companies are included in
the Transferred Companies (as defined in the Global Purchase Agreement) for
all purposes under the Global Purchase Agreement, in each of the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), as though they had always been so included.

 

This Notice and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with New
York law.

Very truly yours,
