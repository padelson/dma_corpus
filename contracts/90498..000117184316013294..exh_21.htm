AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of November 17, 2016, by and between Simmons First National
Corporation (" _Buyer_ "), an Arkansas corporation, and Hardeman County
Investment Company, Inc. (" _Target_ "), a Tennessee corporation.

  



  

Preamble

  



  

The board of directors of Target has adopted, and the board of directors of
Buyer has approved, this Agreement and declared that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of
the Parties to this Agreement and their respective shareholders. This
Agreement provides for the acquisition of Target by Buyer pursuant to the
merger of Target with and into Buyer with Buyer as the surviving corporation.
At the effective time of such Merger, the outstanding shares of capital stock
of Target shall be converted into the right to receive a fixed amount of cash
and a fixed number of shares of common stock of Buyer, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein. As an inducement for Buyer to enter into
this Agreement, certain directors and executive officers of Target
have simultaneously herewith entered into Voting Agreements (each a " _Voting
Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") in connection
with the Merger, in the forms contained in _Exhibit A_ hereto. The
transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the approval of the
shareholders of Target and applicable regulatory authorities and the
satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement. It is
the intention of the Parties to this Agreement that the Merger for federal
income tax purposes shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and this Agreement is intended
to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue Code.

  



  

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are
defined in Section 10.1 of this Agreement.

representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree
as follows:

Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ ") with the effects set forth in the
ABCA and the TBCA (the " _Merger_ "). Buyer shall be the Surviving
Corporation resulting from the Merger, and shall succeed to and assume all
the rights and obligations of Target in accordance with the ABCA. Upon
consummation of the Merger the separate corporate existence of Target shall
terminate. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms of this

Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE 2, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Target or the
shareholders of either of the foregoing, the shares of Target and Buyer shall

Subsidiary, by Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary (in each case other than shares
held in any Employee Benefit Plans or related trust accounts or otherwise
held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted (collectively, the " _Canceled Shares_ ")) shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  Each share of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the Canceled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the following
consideration, in each case without interest:

  



  

(i)  an amount of cash equal to $181.47 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "); and

  



  

(ii)  4.8393 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Buyer Common
Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and together with the Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d)  All shares of Target Common Stock, when so converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a "
_Book-Entry Share_ ") registered in the transfer books of Target that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Target Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Target Common Stock
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
ARTICLE 3, including the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 2.5,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock into which such shares
of Target Common Stock have been converted together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_.

  



  

(e)  Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement
and subject to Sections 6.2(d) and (e), if at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Target should (i)
split, combine or otherwise reclassify the shares of Target Common Stock,
(ii) make a dividend or other distribution in shares of Target Common Stock
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Target Common Stock), (iii) engage in a reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like change, or (iv)
issue additional shares of Target Common Stock or any Equity Right for Target
Common Stock, then (without limiting any other rights of Buyer hereunder), the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect fully the effect of any such
change.

  



  

2.2.  Anti-Dilution Provisions.

  



  

In the event Buyer changes the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to such stock and
the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective
date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar recapitalization for
which a record date is not established) shall be prior to the Effective Time,
the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect fully the effect of any such
change.

  



  

2.3.  Reserved.

  



  

2.4.  Shares Held by Target or Buyer.

  



  

Each Canceled Share shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be issued or delivered in exchange
therefor.

  



  

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.5.  Fractional Shares.

  



  

No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of
Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Buyer shall
relate to such fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder
of Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Target Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash rounded up to
the nearest cent (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock that such holder of shares
of Target Common Stock would otherwise have been entitled multiplied by the
Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration. No such holder will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of
any fractional shares.

  



  

ARTICLE 3 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  



  

3.1.  Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a)   _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or promptly
following the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with Computershare, Buyer's transfer agent or another exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to Target (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of record of shares of Target Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Holders_ "), for
exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, (i) certificates or evidence of
Buyer Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
(collectively referred to as " _Buyer Certificates_ ") for shares of Buyer
Common Stock equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration and (ii) immediately
available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to
the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.5 (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Buyer
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration and
cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. The
cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation. Interest and other income on
the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, as Buyer directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund
shall relieve Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent from
making the payments required by this ARTICLE 3 and following any losses from
any such investment, Buyer shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy Buyer's obligations
hereunder for the benefit of the Holders, which additional funds will be
deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(b)   _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share notice advising such
holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal
materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and instructions for surrendering
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (such materials
and instructions to include customary provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agent's message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares). Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with the appropriate transmittal materials,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the Holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares which such Holder has a right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.5 and any dividends or distributions which such Holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(d) with respect to the shares of
Target Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of Holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The
Stock Consideration delivered to each Holder shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form.

  



  

   

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)   _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of Target shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Target Common Stock. From and
after the Effective Time, Holders who held shares of Target Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section
3.1, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing shares of
Target Common Stock (other than the Canceled Shares) shall from and after the
Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
consideration provided in ARTICLE 2 in exchange therefor, subject, however,
to the Buyer's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been declared or
made by Target in respect of such shares of Target Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares (if any) pursuant to Section 2.5 and any
dividends or distributions (if any) pursuant to Section 3.1(d) with respect
to the shares of Target Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

  



  

(d)   _Dividends with Respect to Buyer Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Buyer Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss and other
documentation required by the Surviving Corporation hereunder in lieu thereof)
there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of Buyer Common
Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such whole shares
of Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously
paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Buyer Common Stock.

  



  

(e)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect
thereto) which remains undistributed to the former Holders on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer, and any former
Holders who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including
any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other
distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock) to which they are entitled
under this ARTICLE 3 shall thereafter look only to Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

  



  

(f)   _No Liability_. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Regulatory Authority), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Buyer, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto or their successors, assigns, or
personal representatives. None of Buyer, Target, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of
any of them, shall be liable to any Holder in respect of any cash that would
have otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

3.2.  Dissenting Shareholders.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the

shares of Target Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Sections 48-23-101 through 48-23-302 of the TBCA (the

the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding,
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and

TBCA, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Holder
is not entitled to the relief provided by Sections 48-23-101 through 48-23-302
of the TBCA, then the right of such Holder to be paid the fair value of such
Holder's Dissenting Shares under Sections 48-23-101 through 48-23-302 of the
TBCA shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c) of this
Agreement, any cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any) pursuant to Section
2.5 and any dividends or distributions (if any) pursuant to Section 3.1(d).

(a)  Each Target Entity has good and marketable title to those
Assets reflected in the most recent Target Financial Statements as being
owned by such Target Entity or acquired after the date thereof (except Assets
sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the Ordinary Course),
free and clear of all Liens, except (a) statutory Liens securing payments not
yet due, (b) Liens for real property Taxes not yet due and payable, (c)
easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not
materially affect the use of the properties or Assets subject thereto or

properties and (d) such imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as
do not materially affect the use of the properties or Assets subject thereto
or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at
such properties (collectively, " _Permitted Liens_ "). Target is the fee
simple owner of all owned real property and the lessee of all leasehold
estates reflected in the most recent Target Financial Statements, free and
clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens, and
is in possession of the properties purported to be owned or leased
thereunder, as applicable. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Target, threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceedings against any
real property that is owned or leased by Target. Target and its Subsidiaries
own or lease all properties as are necessary to their operations as now
conducted and no person has any option or right to acquire or purchase any
ownership interest in the owned real property or any portion thereof.

  



  

(b)  Section 4.12(b) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum sets
forth a complete and correct list of all street addresses and fee owners of
all real property owned, leased or licensed by any Target Entity or otherwise
occupied by a Target Entity or used or held for use by any Target Entity

Target Entity other than such Target Entity, and no Person other than a Target
Entity has the right to use or occupy for any purpose any portion of any of
the Real Property owned, leased or licensed by a Target Entity. Target or a

outstanding options, rights of first offer or refusal or other pre-emptive
rights or purchase rights with respect to any such owned Real Property.

  



  

(c)  All leases of Real Property under which any Target Entity,
as lessee, leases Real Property, are valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms and Target or such Target Subsidiary
has good and marketable leasehold interests to all Real Property leased by
them. There is not under any such lease any material existing Default by any
Target Entity or, to Target's Knowledge, any other party thereto, or any event
which with notice or lapse of time would constitute such a material Default
and all rent and other sums and charges due and payable under such lease have
been paid.

(d)  The Assets reflected in the most recent Target Financial

to sublicense, to any Intellectual Property sold or licensed to a third party
by such Target Entity in connection with such Target Entity's business
operations, and such Target Entity has the right to convey by sale or
license any Intellectual Property so conveyed. No Target Entity is in Default
under any of its Intellectual Property licenses. No proceedings have been
instituted, or are pending or to the Knowledge of Target threatened, which
challenge the rights of any Target Entity with respect to Intellectual
Property used, sold or licensed by such Target Entity in the course of its
business, nor has any person claimed or alleged any rights to such
Intellectual Property. The conduct of the business of the Target Entities and
the use of any Intellectual Property by Target and its Subsidiaries does not
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property
rights of any other person. No Person has asserted to Target in writing that
Target or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated the Intellectual Property rights of such person. The validity,
continuation and effectiveness of all licenses and other agreements relating
to Intellectual Property used by any Target Entity in the course of its
business and the current terms thereof will not be affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the use of the "First South
Bank" and "FSB Insurance, Inc." trademarks will be transferred to Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and after the
Effective Time, no Person besides Buyer shall have right and title to the
"First South Bank" and "FSB Insurance, Inc." trademarks and trade names. All
of the Target Entities' right to the use of and title to the names "First
South Bank" and "FSB Insurance, Inc." will be transferred to Buyer in

businesses of Target and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and (ii) the
Systems are in good working condition to effectively perform all
computing, information technology and data processing operations necessary
for the operation of the respective businesses of Target and each of its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted. To Target's Knowledge, no third party has

any of its Subsidiaries, and Target and each of its Subsidiaries have taken

viruses or other software routines that permit or cause unauthorized access
to, or disruption, impairment, disablement, or destruction of, software, data
or other materials. Target and each of its Subsidiaries has implemented
backup and disaster recovery policies, procedures and systems consistent with
generally accepted industry standards and sufficient to reasonably maintain
the operation of the respective businesses of Target and each of its
Subsidiaries in all material respects.

all material respects with its published privacy policies and
internal privacy policies and guidelines, including with respect to the

Target or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any obligation or
Liability (collectively, the " _Target Benefit Plans_ "). Any of the Target
Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as that term is

Plan_." Section 4.19(a) of Target's Disclosure Memorandum has a complete and
accurate list of all Target Benefit Plans. No Target Benefit Plan is subject
to any Laws other than those of the United States or any state, county, or
municipality in the United States. Target has made available to Buyer prior

audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial or allocation reports,
non-discrimination tests and valuations prepared for any Target Benefit Plan

any Target Benefit Plan, (v) any correspondence with the DOL, IRS, PBGC, or

compliance with the terms of such Target Benefit Plan, and in compliance with
the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, ERISA, and any other
applicable Laws. No Target Benefit Plan is required to be amended within the
ninety-day period beginning on the Closing Date in order to continue to comply
with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and other applicable Law. Each Target
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code is so qualified and has received a favorable
determination letter, or for a prototype or volume submitter plan, opinion
letter, from the IRS that is still in effect and applies to the Target Benefit
Plan and on which such Target Benefit Plan is entitled to rely. Nothing has
occurred and no circumstance exists that could adversely affect the qualified
status of such Target Benefit Plan.

(c)  There are no threatened or pending claims or disputes
under the terms of, or in connection with, the Target Benefit Plans other
than claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course and no action, proceeding,
prosecution, inquiry, hearing or investigation has been commenced with

(d)  Neither Target nor any Affiliate of Target has engaged in
any prohibited transaction for which there is not an exemption, within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to
any Target Benefit Plan and no prohibited transaction has occurred with
respect to any Target Benefit Plan that would be reasonably expected to result
in any liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code.
Neither Target, any Target Entity, any Target Entity employee, or any
committee of which any Target Entity employee is a member has breached his or
her fiduciary duty with respect to a Target Benefit Plan in connection with
any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the administration or
investment of the assets of any Target Benefit Plan. To Target's Knowledge,
no fiduciary, within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA, who is not Target
or any Target Entity employee, has breached his or her fiduciary duty with
respect to a Target Benefit Plan or otherwise has any liability in connection
with any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the administration
or investment of the assets of any Target Benefit Plan that would reasonably
be expected to result in any liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the
Internal Revenue Code being imposed on Target or any Affiliate of Target.

  



  

(e)  Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time
been a party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has
been obligated to contribute to, or had any liability with respect to (i) any
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, including a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in ERISA Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3)), (ii) a "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code), (iii) a
self-funded health or welfare benefit plan, (iv) any voluntary
employees' beneficiary association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)

exempt from, or in compliance with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
or that provides for indemnification for or gross-up of any taxes thereunder.

plan has been amended and administered in accordance with the requirements of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.

  



  

(g)  No Target Entity has any Liability or obligation to
provide postretirement health, medical or life insurance benefits to any
Target Entity's employees or former employees, officers, or directors, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under state or
federal benefits continuation Laws and for which the covered individual pays
the full cost of coverage. No Tax under Internal Revenue Code Sections 4980B
or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any Target Benefit Plan and no
circumstance exists which could give rise to such Tax.

  



  

(h)  All contributions required to be made to any Target Benefit
Plan by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Target Benefit Plan, for any period through
the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Target.

  



  

(i)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of any Target Entity, or result in any (a) requirement to
fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust)
or (b) limitation on the right of any Target Entity to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Target Benefit Plan or
related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
the Target Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Section
4.19(i) of Target's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth accurate and complete
data with respect to each individual who has a contractual right to severance
pay or benefits triggered by a change in control and the amounts potentially
payable to each such individual in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) or as a result of a
termination of employment or service, taking into account any contractual
provisions relating to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. No Target
Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section
4999 or 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise.

delay receipt of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

  



  

4.29.  Loan Matters.

  



  

(a)  Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any written or oral Loan in which Target or any Target Subsidiary is a
creditor which as of September 30, 2016, had an outstanding balance of $50,000
or more and under the terms of which the obligor was, as of October 31, 2016,
over 90 days or more delinquent in payment of principal or interest. Except as
such disclosure may be limited by any applicable Law, Section 4.29(a) of
Target's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true, correct and complete list
of (i) all of the Loans of Target and its Subsidiaries that, (A) as of
September 30, 2016 had an outstanding balance of $50,000 or more and were (1)
on non-accrual status or (2) classified by Target as "Other Loans Specially
Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss,"
"Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch
List" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount of and
accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the aggregate principal

(b)  Each Loan currently outstanding (i) is evidenced by notes,
agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what
they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid
Liens which have been perfected and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding may be brought). The notes or other
credit or security documents with respect to each such outstanding Loan were
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of
origination or purchase by a Target Entity and are complete and correct in
all material respects.

  



  

(c)  Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale to
investors) was solicited and originated, and is and has been
administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are

underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable investors) and with all
applicable requirements of Laws.

  



  

(d)  None of the Contracts pursuant to which any Target Entity
has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans
contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely
on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan. Except as
would not be material to Target and its Subsidiaries, each Loan included in a
pool of Loans originated, securitized or, to the Knowledge of Target,
acquired by Target or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Pool_ ") meets all
eligibility requirements (including all applicable requirements for obtaining
mortgage insurance certificates and Loan guaranty certificates) for inclusion
in such Pool. All such Pools have been finally certified or, if required,
recertified in accordance with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations,
except where the time for certification or recertification has not yet
expired. No Pools have been improperly certified, and, except as would not be
material to Target and its Subsidiaries, no Loan has been bought out of a
Pool without all required approvals of the applicable investors.

  



  

(e)  (i) _Section 4.29(e)_ of Target's Disclosure Memorandum
sets forth a list of all Loans as of the date hereof by Target to any
directors, executive officers and principal shareholders (as such terms are
defined in Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board (12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of
any Target Entity, (ii) there are no employee, officer, director, principal
shareholder or other affiliate Loans on which the borrower is paying a rate
other than that reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security
agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which was not in
compliance with Regulation O and (iii) all such Loans are and were originated
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

  



  

(f)  Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has
it ever been since December 31, 2012, subject to any material fine,
suspension, settlement or other contract or other administrative agreement or
sanction by, or any reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any
Regulatory Agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage
or consumer Loans.

  



  

4.30.  Deposits.

documentation pertaining to such deposits) have been established and are held
in compliance in all material respects with (a) all applicable policies,
practices and procedures of Target Bank and (b) all applicable Laws, including
Money Laundering Laws and anti-terrorism or embargoed persons requirements.
All of the deposits held by Target Bank are insured to the maximum limit set
by the FDIC, and the FDIC premium and all assessments have been fully paid,
and no proceedings for the termination or revocation of such insurance are
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Target, threatened.

4.31.  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.

  



  

The allowance for loan and lease losses (" _ALLL_ ") reflected in the Target
Financial Statements was, as of the date of each of the Target Financial
Statements, in the opinion of management of Target, in compliance with
Target's existing methodology for determining the adequacy of its ALLL and in
compliance in all material respects with the standards established by the
applicable Regulatory Authority, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and
GAAP, and is adequate.

Disclosure Memorandum contains a true, correct and complete list and a
brief description (including the name of the insurer, agent, coverage and the
expiration date) of all insurance policies in force on the date hereof with
respect to the business and Assets of the Target Entities, correct and
complete copies of which policies have been provided to Buyer prior to the
date hereof. The Target Entities are in material compliance with their
insurance policies and are not in Default under any of the material terms
thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of the Target Entities, Target or Target Bank is the
sole beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due under
any such policy have been paid, and all material claims thereunder have been
filed in due and timely fashion. To Target's Knowledge, no Target Entity has
received any written notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any such
policies, nor, to Target's Knowledge, is the termination of any such policies
threatened.

reasonably designed and maintained to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Buyer in the Buyer
SEC Reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive officer,

make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of Buyer required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyer's internal
control over financial reporting.

  



  

(e)  Since December 31, 2012, (i) neither any Buyer Entity nor,

questionable accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney
representing any Buyer Entity, whether or not employed by any Buyer Entity,
has reported evidence of a material violation of Securities Laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Buyer or any of its officers,

been fully and timely paid. There are no Liens for any material amount of
Taxes (other than a Lien for Taxes not yet due and payable or for which are

requiring any Buyer Entity to enter into or consent to the issuance of a cease
and desist order, injunction, formal or informal agreement, directive,
consent decree, commitment or memorandum of understanding, order

which restricts materially the conduct of its business.

  



  

5.10.  Legal Proceedings.

statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, including Call Reports, that it was required to file with Regulatory

statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or
necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading.

  



  

5.12.  Statements True and Correct.

Buyer Entity or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion (including by

material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the

taken or agreed to take any action, and Buyer does not have any Knowledge of

ARTICLE 7 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  



  

7.1.  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement; Shareholder
Approvals.

  



  

(a)  Buyer and Target shall promptly prepare and file with the
SEC, a proxy statement/prospectus in definitive form (including any
amendments thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and Buyer shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Registration Statement (including the prospectus of
Buyer and Proxy Statement constituting a part thereof and all related
documents) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, subject to full cooperation of both Parties and their respective
advisors and accountants. Buyer and Target agree to cooperate, and to cause
their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other Party and its
counsel and its accountants in the preparation of the Registration Statement
and the Proxy Statement. Each of Buyer and Target agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after filing thereof, and Target shall thereafter mail or deliver
the Proxy Statement to its shareholders promptly following the date of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Buyer also agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law
or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Target shall furnish all information
concerning Target and the holders of Target Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Each of Buyer and Target agrees
to furnish to the other Party all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable or as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Buyer, Target
or their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Authority in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Target shall have the right to review and consult with Buyer with respect to
any information included in, the Registration Statement prior to its being
filed with the SEC. Buyer will advise Target, promptly after Buyer receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Buyer Common Stock
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or written threat
of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information.

(b)  Target shall duly call, give notice of, establish a record
date for, convene and hold a shareholders' meeting (" _Target
's Shareholders' Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for the
purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement by a majority of the
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the "
_Target Shareholder Approval_ ") and such other related matters as it deems
appropriate. Target agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section
7.1(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, proposal, disclosure or
communication to Target of any Acquisition Proposal. Target shall (i) through
its board of directors (which shall unanimously recommend and determine
advisable the Merger and this Agreement), recommend to its shareholders the
approval of this Agreement (the " _Target Recommendation_ "), (ii) include
such Target Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Target Shareholder Approval. Neither the
board of directors of Target nor any committee thereof shall withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Buyer, the Target Recommendation or take any action, or
make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the
Target Recommendation (any of the foregoing being a " _Change in the Target
Recommendation_ "). If requested by Buyer, Target shall retain a proxy
solicitor reasonably acceptable to, and on terms reasonably acceptable to,
Buyer in connection with obtaining the Target Shareholder Approval.

  



  

(c)  Target shall adjourn or postpone Target's Shareholders'
Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled
there are insufficient shares of Target Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting. Target shall also adjourn or postpone Target's
Shareholders' Meeting, if on the date of Target's Shareholders' Meeting
Target has not recorded proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Target Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Target's Shareholders' Meeting shall be convened and
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Target at
Target's Shareholders' Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of
this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Target of such obligation. Target
shall only be required to adjourn or postpone Target's Shareholders' Meeting
three times pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 7.1(c).

  



  

7.2.  Acquisition Proposals.

  



  

During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE 9, each Target Entity
shall not, and shall cause its respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, take any action to solicit, encourage (including by providing
information or assistance), initiate, facilitate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or provide or make available any information to or enter
into any agreement with any Person (other than a Buyer Entity and their
Representatives) concerning any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal. Each Target Entity
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished to any Person (other than the Buyer Entities and their
Representatives) that has made or indicated an intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal. If any Target Entity or their respective
Representatives receives any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, Target
shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than two Business Days)
notify Buyer in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the Person making any
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), and Target shall as promptly
as practicable (but in no event more than two Business Days) provide to Buyer
(a) a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if in writing,
or (b) a written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, if oral. Target shall provide Buyer as promptly as
practicable (but in no event more than two Business Days) with notice setting
forth all such information as is necessary to keep Buyer informed on a current
basis in all material respects of all communications regarding (including
material amendments or proposed material amendments to) such Acquisition
Proposal request or inquiry.

7.3.  Exchange Listing.

  



  

Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective
Time, on NASDAQ the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to the holders
of Target Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Buyer shall give all
notices and make all filings with NASDAQ required in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

7.4.  Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

  



  

(a)  Buyer and Target and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all applications, notices and filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Regulatory Authorities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to
comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such third parties and Regulatory Authorities. Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, which
may be asserted with respect to the Merger under any applicable Law or Order;
provided, that in no event shall Buyer be required to accept any new
restriction or condition on the Buyer Entities which is materially
burdensome on Buyer's business or on the business of Target or Target Bank,
in each case following the Closing or which would likely reduce the economic
benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Buyer to such a
degree that Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement had such
condition or restriction been known to it at the date hereof (any such
condition or restriction, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Each of Buyer and
Target shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing review and consultation rights, each of the
Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
Party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other Party hereto with
respect to the obtaining of all material Permits and Consents of third parties
and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the other
Party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the other Party upon
receiving any communication from a Regulatory Authority the Consent of which
is required for the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any required consent or approval from a
Regulatory Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of such consent
or approval may be materially delayed (a " _Regulatory Communication_ ").
Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication, without limiting the scope of
the foregoing paragraphs, the receiving Party shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law (i) promptly advise the other Party of the receipt of such
Regulatory Communication, (ii) provide the other Party with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the preparation of any response thereto and the
preparation of any other substantive submission or communication to any
Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and
to review any such response, submission or communication prior to the filing
or submission thereof (other than portions of materials to be filed or
submitted in connection therewith that contain confidential or non-public
supervisory information or competitively sensitive business or proprietary
information), and (iii) if permitted by the applicable Regulatory Authority,
provide the other Party with the opportunity to participate in any meetings
or substantive telephone conversations that the receiving party or its
Representatives may have from time to time with any Regulatory Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent such
meetings or telephone conversations do not contain or involve confidential or
non-public supervisory information, competitively sensitive business
or proprietary information.

  



  

   

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  Each Party agrees, upon request, subject to applicable Laws
related to the exchange of information, to promptly furnish the other Party
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Authority.

  



  

7.5.  Investigation and Confidentiality.

  



  

(a)  Each Party shall promptly notify the other of any material
change in the normal course of its business or in the operation of its
properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, of any material
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of a material claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
involving that Party.

  



  

(b)  Each Party shall promptly advise the other of any fact,
change, event or circumstance known to that Party (i) that has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on that Party or (ii)
which that Party believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE 8;
provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 7.5(b) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2
to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 to be satisfied.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall permit Buyer to
make or cause to be made such investigation of the business and properties of
it and its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and legal conditions
as Buyer reasonably requests, provided that such investigation shall not
interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. No investigation by Buyer
shall affect the ability of Buyer to rely on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of Target. Neither Buyer nor Target nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Buyer's or Target's, as the case may be, customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
Parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding Contract entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

   

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d)  Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents
to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to
it by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses,
operations, and financial positions and shall not use such information for
any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and
copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information
received from the other Party.

  



  

7.6.  Press Releases.

  



  

Target and Buyer agree that no press release or other public disclosure or
communication (including communications to employees, agents and contractors
of Target) related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be issued by either Party (or its Affiliates) without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6
shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any press release or other
public disclosure required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United
States or non-United States securities exchange, in which case the Party
required to make the release or disclosure shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release
or disclosure in advance of the issuance thereof. The Parties have agreed upon
the form of a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

7.7.  Tax Treatment.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action
which would cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax
purposes. The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
in order to obtain the Tax Opinion. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

  



  

(b)  Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of
Buyer and Target shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take any
inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

  



  

7.8.  Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  



  

(a)  Following the Effective Time, except as contemplated by
this Agreement, Buyer shall provide generally to officers and employees (as a
group) who are actively employed by a Target Entity on the Closing Date ("
_Covered Employees_ ") while employed by Buyer following the Closing Date
employee benefits under Employee Benefit Plans offered to similarly situated
employees of Buyer, including severance benefits in accordance with the
applicable severance policy of Buyer (other than to any Covered Employee who
is party to individual agreements or letters that entitle such person to
different severance or termination benefits); provided, that in no event
shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen
plan of any Buyer Entity. Until such time as Buyer shall cause the Covered
Employees to participate in the applicable Buyer Employee Benefit Plans, the
continued participation of the Covered Employees in the Target Benefit Plans
shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause (it being
understood that participation in Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans may commence
at different times with respect to each of Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans).
For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under
Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans, and for purposes of determining a Covered
Employee's entitlement to paid time off under Buyer's paid time off program,
the service of the Covered Employees with a Target Entity prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with a Buyer Entity participating
in such employee benefit plans, to the same extent that such service was
recognized by the Target Entities for purposes of a similar benefit plan;
provided, that such recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate
any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service
or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under
which similarly-situated employees of Buyer Entities do not receive credit for
prior service, (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation, or (z) for purposes of retiree medical
benefits or level of benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.

  



  

   

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  If requested by Buyer in a writing delivered to Target
following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, the Target Entities
shall take all necessary action (including without limitation the adoption of
resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any required notices) to
terminate, effective as of no later than the day before the Closing Date, any
Target Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute either a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) (a "
_401(k) Plan_ ") or a tax-qualified defined contribution plan under Internal
Revenue Code Section 401(a) (" _ESOP_ "). Target shall provide Buyer with a
copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared
to effectuate the termination of the 401(k) Plans and ESOPs in advance and
give Buyer a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents
(which comments shall be considered in good faith), and prior to the Closing
Date, Target shall provide Buyer with the final documentation evidencing that
the 401(k) Plans and ESOPs have been terminated.

  



  

(c)  Upon request by Buyer in writing prior to the Closing
Date, the Target Entities shall cooperate in good faith with Buyer prior to
the Closing Date to amend, freeze, terminate or modify any other Target
Benefit Plan to the extent and in the manner determined by Buyer effective
upon the Closing Date (or at such different time mutually agreed to by the
parties) and consistent with applicable Law. Target shall provide Buyer with
a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents
prepared to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 7.8(c), as
applicable, and give Target a reasonable opportunity to comment on such
documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith), and prior to
the Closing Date, Target shall provide Buyer with the final
documentation evidencing that the actions contemplated herein have been
effectuated.

  



  

(d)  The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely for the
benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no Covered Employee, current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event
shall the terms of this Agreement: (i) establish, amend, or modify any Target
Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Buyer, Target or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Buyer or any Buyer
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Target Entities) to
amend, modify or terminate any Target Benefit Plan, employment agreement or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant, any right to employment or continued
employment or continued service with Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, the Target Entities), or
constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee, or interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Target,
Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Target or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause.

  



  

   

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.9.  Indemnification.

  



  

(a)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors or
officers of the Target Entities (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all
Liabilities arising out of actions or omissions arising out of the
Indemnified Party's service or services as directors or officers of
Target or, at Target's request, of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the
fullest extent permitted under state Law and by Target's charter and bylaws
as in effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to advances of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation and whether or not any
Buyer Entity is insured against any such matter. Without limiting the
foregoing, in any case in which approval by Buyer is required to effectuate
any indemnification, Buyer shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified
Party, that the determination of any such approval shall be made by
independent counsel mutually agreed upon between Buyer and the Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(b)  Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts (and Target
shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in
effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time Target's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (provided that Buyer may
substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less
advantageous or (ii) with the consent of Target given prior to the Effective
Time, any other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events
which occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering persons who are
currently covered by such insurance; provided, that Buyer shall not be
obligated to make aggregate premium payments for such six-year period in
respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for
the portion related to Target's directors and officers, 200% of the annual
premium payments currently paid on Target's current policy in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the
foregoing, Buyer, or Target in consultation with Buyer, may obtain on or
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in this Section 7.9(b) at a premium not
to exceed the Maximum Amount. If the premium necessary to purchase such
"tail" prepaid policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Buyer may purchase the most
advantageous "tail" prepaid policy obtainable for a premium equal to the
Maximum Amount, and in each case, Buyer shall have no further
obligations under this Section 7.9(b) other than to maintain such "tail"
prepaid policy.

  



  

(c)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under Section 7.9(a), upon learning of any such Liability or
Litigation, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof. In the event of any such
Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) Buyer
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Buyer shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Buyer elects not to
assume such defense or independent legal counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Buyer and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Buyer shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided, that Buyer shall be obligated
pursuant to this Section 7.9(c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such Litigation; and (iii) Buyer shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided, further,
that Buyer shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

  



  

   

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d)  If Buyer or any successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or if Buyer (or any
successors or assigns) shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets
to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.9.

  



  

(e)  The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and Representatives.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.9 to the
contrary, no indemnification payments will be made to an Indemnified Party
with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any
federal banking agency unless all of the following conditions are met: (i)
the Buyer's board of directors determines in writing that the Indemnified
Party acted in good faith and in the best interests of the Target or Target
Bank; (ii) the Buyer's board of directors determines that the payment
will not materially affect the Buyer's safety and soundness; (iii) the
payment does not fall within the definition of a prohibited indemnification
payment under 12 C.F.R. Part 359; and (iv) the Indemnified Party agrees in
writing to reimburse the Buyer, to the extent not covered by permissible
insurance, for payments made in the event that the administrative or civil
action instituted by a banking Regulatory Authority results in a final order
or settlement in which the Indemnified Party is assessed a civil
money penalty, is prohibited from banking, or is required to cease an action
or perform an affirmative action.

  



  

7.10.  Operating Functions.

  



  

Target and Target Bank shall cooperate with Buyer and Buyer Bank in
connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of the
Parties and the operation of Buyer Bank and Target Bank, and in preparing for
the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be effective at the
Effective Time or such later date as Buyer may decide. Target shall take any
action Buyer may reasonably request prior to the Effective Time to facilitate
the combination of the operations of Target with Buyer. Each Party shall
cooperate with the other Party in preparing to execute after the Effective
Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally
(including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other party).
Without limiting the foregoing, Target shall provide office space and support
services (and other reasonably requested support and assistance) in
connection with the foregoing, and senior officers of Target and Buyer shall
meet from time to time as Target or Buyer may reasonably request to review
the financial and operational affairs of Target and Target Bank, and Target
shall give due consideration to Buyer's input on such matters, with the
understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, (a) neither Buyer nor Buyer Bank shall under any circumstance be
permitted to exercise control of Target, Target Bank or any other Target
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (b) neither Target nor any Target
Bank shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably
be deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state
antitrust Laws, and (c) neither Target nor Target Bank shall be required to
agree to any material obligation that is not contingent upon the consummation
of the Merger.

  



  

   

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.11.  Shareholder Litigation.

  



  

Each of Buyer and Target shall promptly notify each other in writing of any
action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena
or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or
otherwise involving, any Regulatory Authority or arbitrator pending or, to
the Knowledge of Buyer or Target, as applicable, threatened against Buyer,
Target or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken
by Buyer, Target or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or
thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Target shall give Buyer every opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against
Target and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Buyer's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

7.12.  Legal Conditions to Merger.

  



  

Subject to Sections 7.1 and 7.4 of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Target
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts
(a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable
to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on
such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other Party to obtain) any Consent or Order by, any Regulatory Authority and
any other third party that is required to be obtained by Target or Buyer or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with, or to effect, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at
any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, any merger between a
Subsidiary of Buyer, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Target, on the other
hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the Parties to
the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each Party and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer.

  



  

7.13.  Change of Method.

  



  

Buyer may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger (including by
providing for the merger of Target with a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer) if
and to the extent requested by Buyer, and Target agrees to enter into such

10.9.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  



  

(a)  The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in all respects in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Arkansas without regard to any conflict of Laws or choice of Law principles
that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement
to the substantive Law of another jurisdiction (except that matters relating
to the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Target shall be subject
to the Laws of the State of Tennessee).

(b)  Each Party agrees that it will bring any action or
proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in any
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of
Arkansas (the "Chosen Courts"), and, solely in connection with claims arising
under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
10.8.

  



  

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT,
ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.9.

  



  

10.10.  Counterparts; Signatures.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of
a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall
be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument
and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were
the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party hereto or
to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a
signature to this Agreement or any amendment or waiver hereto or any agreement
or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each Party hereto
forever waives any such defense.

  



  

10.11.  Captions; Articles and Sections.

  



  

The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the referenced
Articles and Sections of this Agreement.

10.12.  Interpretations.

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No Party to this Agreement shall be considered the
draftsman. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and,
unless otherwise defined herein, the words used shall be construed and
interpreted according to their ordinary meaning so as fairly to accomplish
the purposes and intentions of all Parties hereto.

  



  

10.13.  Enforcement of Agreement.

  



  

The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that money damages
would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled,
without the requirement of posting bond, to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties waives any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

  



  

10.14.  Severability.

  



  

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

  



  

10.15.  Disclosure.

  



  

Any disclosure made in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
referred to or described in writing in any Section of this Agreement, in any
schedule or exhibit attached hereto or in any Disclosure Memorandum shall
apply only to, or only qualify, the indicated Section of this
Agreement, except to the extent that (a) any other Section of this Agreement
specifically referenced or cross-referenced in such disclosure or (b) the
relevance of such item to another Section of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other Sections of this Agreement.
