fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no

or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Target or the Target Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Target. Target and Target Bank have disclosed,
based on their most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to their auditors and the audit committee of their respective
boards of directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect

any material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in their internal controls. Since December 31, 2012, neither Target nor Target Bank nor, to Target&rsquo;s
Knowledge, any employee, auditor, accountant or representative of any Target Entity has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge

premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion
related to Target&rsquo;s directors and officers, 200% of the annual premium payments currently paid on Target&rsquo;s current

(i) Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Buyer shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Buyer elects not to assume such defense or independent legal counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Buyer and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Buyer shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
