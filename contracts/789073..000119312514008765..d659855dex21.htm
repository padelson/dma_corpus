AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the
rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in accordance with Section 259
of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place (a) at 10:00 a.m. (U.S. Central time) on the fifth (5th) Business
Day following the satisfaction, or, if permissible, waiver by the party
entitled to the benefit thereof, of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to their satisfaction, or, if permissible, waiver by the
party entitled to the benefit thereof, at the Closing) or (b) at another time
or date agreed to in writing by the parties. The Closing will take place at
the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60603
or at another place agreed to in writing by the parties.

 

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective on the date and time at which the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such other date and time as is agreed between the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective
Time_ ").

Section 1.04 _Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation_.

(a) _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time and by virtue of the
Merger, (i) the Company Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set
forth in _Exhibit A_ , and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the Company By-laws
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and
restated, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (except that
references to the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of
the Surviving Corporation), in each case until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



2 (b) _Directors_. The board of directors of the Surviving Corporation effective
as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time shall consist of the
members of the board of directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Officers_. As of and immediately following the Effective Time, the
officers of the Company shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and all of such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall cease to exist,
and each certificate representing a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-
certificated Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that
formerly represented any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall
thereafter be cancelled and cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest
thereon, in each case subject to _Section 2.01(b)_ and _Section 2.05_.

(ii)  _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent or
any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Shares the same

 



3  economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount
payable by Parent pursuant to  _Section 2.02_ after giving effect to any
such event exceed the amount that would have been payable pursuant to _Section
2.02_ had such event not occurred and (ii) nothing in this _Section 2.01_
shall permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities
that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association or another U.S.-based nationally recognized
financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to
which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this  _Section 2.02_.
Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.02(b)_, at or promptly
following the Closing, but in any event prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent,
in immediately available funds, a cash amount equal to the Aggregate Common
Stock Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be for
the benefit of the holders of Shares that are entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.02_. For purposes of
determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that
no stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right to appraisal of such
stockholders Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by this _Section 2.02_, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to the
Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or in commercial paper obligations rated P1 or A-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant
to this _Section 2.02_; _provided_ , that no investment of such deposited
funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from
promptly making the payments required by this _Section 2.02_, and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, in the
amount of such losses (but only to the extent such losses result in the
Exchange Fund being less than the amounts that remain payable to the holders
of Shares under this _Section 2.02_), which additional funds will be held and
disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying
Agent to make the payments contemplated by this _Section 2.02_. Any interest
or income produced by such investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as
Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange
Fund for the benefit of the former holders of Shares and to make payments from
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Section 2.02_. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to
this _Section 2.02_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than the third Business Day following
the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a

 



4  customary letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ to the Paying Agent) and shall otherwise be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
after consultation with the Company and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificate in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, and upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and in
proper form, with respect to such Certificate, and such other documentation as
may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section
2.01_ (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made and the Merger Consideration may
be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid and shall deliver
such other documentation as may be reasonably required by the Paying
Agent. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares
shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered and shall be made promptly following the Effective Time without any
action on the part of the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with  _Section 2.02(e)_) or Book-Entry Share.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this  _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it or the Surviving
Corporation any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest
received with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance

 



5  with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_, without interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law and (ii) if any Shares shall not
have been properly surrendered five years after the Effective Time (or, if
earlier, immediately prior to the date on which the aggregate Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such payment with respect to such
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto or any other holder of the Shares.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, subject to the other provisions
of this _Article II_ , issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant
to  _Section 2.01(a)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Options, RSUs, DSUs, Performance Awards
and Equity Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Companys
board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock
Plan (the " _Company Options_ ") shall vest in full (or, with respect to any
Company Option granted after the date hereof, in accordance with _Section
5.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) and be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled
to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(i) the vested portion of the total number of Shares subject to such
cancelled Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled
Company Option, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the "
_Option Payments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such Company
Option with respect to which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in
exchange for no consideration and (ii) such Option Payments may be reduced by
the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_.
The Option Payments shall be paid out in accordance with  _Section 2.03(h)_.
From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option shall be exercisable, and
each Company Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to the payment
provided for in this _Section 2.03(a)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted

 



6  stock units (" _RSUs_ ") with respect to Shares (each, an " _RSU Award_ ")
granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall vest in full (or, with respect
to any RSU Award granted after the date hereof, in accordance with _Section
5.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) and be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such RSU Award and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the sum of (A)
the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the vested
portion of the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award and (B) all dividend
equivalents accrued with respect to such underlying vested RSUs to the extent
such dividend equivalents are required by the terms and conditions set forth
in the applicable award agreement for such RSUs as in effect prior to the
date hereof, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _RSU
Payments_ ") (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.05_). The RSU Payments shall be paid out in accordance with _Section
2.03(h)_.

(c) _Treatment of Deferred Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the

Plans and to ensure that all Company Options, RSUs, DSUs, Performance Awards
or other rights with respect to Shares which have been granted or issued
by the Company (or promised to be issued pursuant to Contracts or offer
letters pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound) are
cancelled as of the Effective Time without any payment or other consideration
therefor, other than the cash payments required by this _Section 2.03_, and
no further Company Options, RSUs, DSUs, Performance Awards or other rights

to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section

concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of such Shares
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in _Section 2.01(a)(i)_, but shall become
the right to receive the fair value of such Shares pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder
effectively withdraws such Dissenting Stockholders demand for appraisal or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting Stockholders right of
appraisal with respect to such Shares, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, such
Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without
interest and subject to _Section 2.05_, and such Shares shall not be deemed
to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make or offer to make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

Section 2.05 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the
Shares, Company Options, RSU Awards, DSU Awards and Performance Awards vested
or cancelled in the Merger, such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of
restrictions or other actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options,
RSU Awards, DSU Awards or Performance Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events, whether contingent or otherwise): (i) result in any material payment
or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
result in the forgiveness of any material Indebtedness of any such director,
officer or employee, (iii) materially increase the amount or value of any

such Proceedings or assessments, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. No deficiency with respect to Taxes has been

pursuant to which the financial institution party thereto (the " _Debt
Financing Source_ ") has committed, subject solely to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 3.02(a)_ , _Section 3.02(b)_ and  _Section 3.02(d)_, at the

withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any
respect other than in a manner contemplated by _Section 5.06(a)_. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to
the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement, is a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,

Letters, engagement letters with respect to the Debt Financing and any
agreements entered into after the date of this Agreement that are expressly
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or permissible under _Section
5.06(a)_) relating to the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Sub or the Debt
Financing Source, under any term of, or a failure of any condition under, the
Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise result in any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable at the Closing and since the
date of this Agreement there has been no such event except as permitted under

warranties set forth in _Section 3.02(a)_ and _Section 3.02(b)_, the
performance in all material respects by the Company of its obligations under

Source would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
the Debt Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by such person. Parent or
Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making of any Competing
Proposal) in connection with the Transactions.

of the Company set forth in this Agreement are true and correct in all
material respects, (b) the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Sub to
consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, (c) any estimates,

Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby, then at and immediately
following the Effective Time and after giving effect to all of the
Transactions, including the funding of the Debt Financing and the Financing
Uses, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation will be, on a consolidated basis, Solvent. Parent and Sub are not
entering into the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors.

Section 4.10  _Acknowledgement of No Other Representations or Warranties_.

upon any information or statements (or any omissions therefrom) provided or
made available by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
affiliates or representatives to Parent, Sub or their respective affiliates
or representatives in connection with the Transactions.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
affiliates has entered into any Contract or any commitments to enter into any
Contract pursuant to which: (i) any stockholder of the Company would be

with, any Superior Proposal; or (ii) any third party has agreed to
provide, directly or indirectly, any capital (other than pursuant to the Debt

the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such
term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
have not been registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold unless

cause their respective directors, officers, investment bankers, counsel and
similarly authorized representatives (collectively, the " _Company

indirect solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any persons that may
be ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal or any potential Competing
Proposal, (B) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to any potential Competing Proposal and (C) use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause any person and its representatives that has
received confidential information concerning the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with a potential Competing Proposal to promptly
return or destroy the confidential information furnished thereto by or on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and to destroy all analyses
and other material prepared by or on behalf of such person or its
representatives that contain, reflect or analyze such information, in each
case, in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement and (ii) not
to, directly or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage
any inquiry, offer or proposal with respect to, or the submission or
announcement of, any Competing Proposal, (B) furnish any non-public
information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any person in
connection with or in response to a Competing Proposal or a potential
Competing Proposal or (C) participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any person with respect to any Competing Proposal or a potential Competing
Proposal. In addition, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_, (i) neither the Companys board of directors nor any committee
thereof shall (except with respect to Parent and its affiliates and their
respective representatives) (x) grant any waiver, amendment or release under
any Takeover Statute or (y) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (or terminate or fail to
enforce such agreement) except solely to the extent necessary to allow the
other party to such agreement to make a confidential Competing Proposal to the
Companys board of directors and (ii) the Company shall not, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries not to, reimburse or agree to reimburse the expenses
of any other person (other than the Companys Representatives) in connection

could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.03(b)_, if, at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a _bona fide_ written
Competing Proposal from a person that did not result from a material breach of
this _Section 5.03_ by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
Company Representatives, (ii) the Companys board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal

 



36  and (iii) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take the actions described in  _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ below would be
inconsistent with the board of directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Competing Proposal and its representatives regarding such Competing Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (x) will not, will cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Company
Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information regarding the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to such person without first
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person; (y)
will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise Parent of the receipt
of any Competing Proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal (and shall disclose to Parent the identity of any
person making such Competing Proposal and the terms thereof and the other
information required to be provided to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.03(c)_)
and (z) will as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours
thereafter) provide to Parent any written information concerning the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other person
(or its representatives), and any material information concerning the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries provided to such other person (or its
representatives) orally, that was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. So long as the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives have otherwise complied with this  _Section 5.03_, none of
the foregoing shall prohibit the Company or the Company Representatives from
contacting any person or group of persons that has made a Competing Proposal
after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Competing Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and, if the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives
have otherwise complied with this _Section 5.03_, any such actions shall not
be a breach of this _Section 5.03_.

 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with 
_Article VII_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Parent of the receipt of any Competing Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal, offer or request for information with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to result in, a Competing Proposal, or any discussions
or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any Company Representatives concerning a Competing
Proposal, indicating, in each case, the identity of the person or group of
persons making such Competing Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request
for information and a copy of any such Competing Proposal (including, if
applicable, copies of any documentation constituting the Competing Proposal,
including proposed agreements and financing commitments, and any amendments or
modifications thereto) or a written summary of the material terms and
conditions of such Competing Proposal not made in writing, and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail, on a prompt basis
(and in any event within 24 hours), of any material developments or
modifications to the terms of such Competing Proposal, inquiry, offer,
proposal or request (including, if applicable, copies of any documentation
constituting the Competing Proposal, including proposed agreements and
financing commitments, and any amendments or modifications thereto) and the

 



37  status of any such inquiry, proposal, offer, request for information,
discussions or negotiations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit
any Company Subsidiary to, enter into any agreement that prohibits or
restricts it from providing to Parent the information contemplated by this
_Section 5.03(c)_ or otherwise complying with the other provisions of this
_Section 5.03_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except as set
forth in  _Section 5.03(e)_ or _Section 5.03(f)_, neither the Companys
board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) adopt, authorize,
approve or recommend any Competing Proposal or potential Competing Proposal,
or, in each case, publicly propose to do so, (ii) withhold, modify or amend,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, or in each case
publicly propose to do so, or fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement (any action set forth in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ or
_(ii)_ , a " _Change of Company Recommendation_ ") or (iii) authorize, cause
or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to any
Competing Proposal or potential Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Companys board of directors may make a Change of Company Recommendation with
respect to a Competing Proposal if, and only if:

 

(i) (A) such Competing Proposal (that did not result from a material breach of
_Section 5.03_ by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or Company
Representatives) is made to the Company by a person and such Competing
Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the Companys board of directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Companys
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(f)_ (a " _Notice of Change of
Recommendation_ "), which notice shall identify the person making such
Superior Proposal and include copies of the documentation constituting such
Superior Proposal, including proposed agreements and financing commitments,
and any amendments or modifications thereto (it being agreed that the
delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company shall not
constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

(iii) the Company has negotiated, and has used its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and
its affiliates and their respective representatives with respect to any
changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other
agreements relating to the Transactions for at least five (5) Business Days
following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of Recommendation (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment or modification to any
material term or condition (including any financial term or any termination
fee, expense reimbursement provision or any

 



38  term or condition relating to conditionality or the timing of consummation)
of such Superior Proposal shall require the Company to deliver a new Notice of
Change of Recommendation to Parent with respect to such amendment or
modification and an additional two (2) Business Day period from the date of
such notice during which the Company shall comply again with this _Section
5.03(e)(i)-(iii)_); and

 

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and any other agreements relating to the Transactions proposed by
Parent to the Company, the Companys board of directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be
given effect.

(f) Other than in connection with a Competing Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.03(e)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
5.03(f)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Companys
board of directors from, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, withholding, modifying or amending, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Recommendation if the Companys board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Companys board of
directors to effect a Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; 
_provided_ , that, (A) the Company shall give Parent advance written notice of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances underlying the Companys board of
directors determination that the failure to effect a Change of Company
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (it being agreed that the delivery of such notice by the
Company shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation), (B) the
Company shall negotiate and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and its
affiliates and their respective representatives with respect to any changes
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other agreements
relating to the Transactions for at least five (5) Business Days following
receipt by Parent of such notice (it being understood and agreed that
following receipt by Parent of such notice but prior to the determination by
the Companys board of directors to effect a Change of Company Recommendation
any material change relating to the facts and circumstances underlying such
determination shall require the Company to deliver a new notice pursuant to
this _Section 5.03(f)_ and an additional two (2) Business Day period from the
date of such notice during which the Company shall comply again with this 
_Section 5.03(f)(A)-(B)_) and (C) after taking into account any changes to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other agreements relating
to the Transactions proposed by Parent, the Companys board of directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a
Change of Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the Companys
board of directors from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Companys board of

 



39  directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the
issuance by the Company or the Companys board of directors of a "stop, look
and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not
constitute a Change of Company Recommendation); _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Companys board of directors nor any committee thereof may effect
a Change of Company Recommendation except pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 5.03(e)_ or _Section 5.03(f)_.

 

Section 5.04 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the operation of any business conducted by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company,
to the officers, employees, Contracts, properties, offices and other
facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such information concerning the
business, properties, Contracts, officers, employees, assets and liabilities
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its representatives may
reasonably request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or
furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith
that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
(provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any confidentiality obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third person or otherwise breach,
contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is party (provided that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in any such violation, breach or contravention);
(iii) result in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
receiving information that is competitively sensitive (provided that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure to Parent, Sub and their respective representatives in a manner
that does not give rise to material competitive concerns, including through
providing access or disclosure to "clean teams" of Parent, Sub and their
respective representatives); or (iv) breach, contravene or violate any
applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law) (provided
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a breach, violation
or contravention). Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective representatives to, hold all information provided or
furnished pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ confidential in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit to the business or
property sites of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of
Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their respective representatives
accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries reasonable safety and security
procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 5.04_, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, none
of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall conduct, without
the prior written consent of the Company, any environmental investigation at
any real property owned or leased by the Company that involves any sampling or
other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater or soil at
such real property. No access or information provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.04_ will affect any of the representations or warranties made by
the Company in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations
of the parties hereto.

 



40 Section 5.05 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law,
each of Parent and the Company shall (and Parent shall cause each of its
affiliates to and the Company shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to)
use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary or advisable to
consummate the Transactions and to cause the conditions set forth in 
_Article VI_ to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall (and shall cause Sub and each of Parents or Subs
affiliates to) and the Company shall (and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly
obtain all actions or nonactions, consents, Permits (including Environmental
Permits), waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders from Governmental
Entities or other persons necessary or advisable in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) as promptly as practicable (and, with
respect to the filing required to be made under the HSR Act, within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement and with respect to the
filings required to be made outside of the United States, within twenty-five
(25) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall only require that the initial filings be made during such
twenty-five (25) Business Day period)) make and not withdraw (without the
Companys consent) all registrations and filings with any Governmental Entity
or other persons necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions, including the filings required of the parties or their
"ultimate parent entities" under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, and
promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary or
advisable, (iii) defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory,
administrative or other Proceedings to which it or any of its affiliates is a
party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable
order with respect to, or settlement of, each such lawsuit or other
Proceeding, (iv) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order which prevents the parties from consummating the
Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order
with respect thereto or the settlement thereof, (v) seek to resolve any
objection or assertion by any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the Transactions and (vi) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions; _provided_
, _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or the immediately preceding
sentence, in no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates be required to
pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party to obtain any
consent or approval under any Contract (it being acknowledged and agreed, for
the avoidance of doubt, that Parent shall pay any fee required to be paid by
Parent to a Governmental Entity at the time of making any of the registrations
and filings described in _clause (ii)_ above).

 

(b) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in _Section 5.05(a)_, (i)
Parent shall promptly take (and shall cause each of its affiliates to take)
any and all actions necessary or advisable in order to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment to the consummation of the Transactions and obtain all
approvals and consents, in each case, under any Antitrust Laws that may be
required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Entity,
in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to
consummate the Transactions as

 



41  promptly as practicable, including accepting operational restrictions or
limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale, license, disposition or
holding separate of, such assets or businesses of Parent, Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates (and the entry
into agreements with, and submission to decrees, judgments, injunctions or
orders of such Governmental Entity) as may be required to obtain such
approvals or consents of such Governmental Entities or to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments,
injunctions or orders under any Antitrust Laws that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the
Transactions, subject to, in each case, the condition that the Transactions
actually occur and (ii) the Company shall make, subject to the condition that
the Transactions actually occur, any undertakings (including undertakings to
accept operational restrictions or limitations or to make sales or other
dispositions, provided that such restrictions, limitations, sales or other
dispositions are conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions) as are
required to obtain such approvals or consents of such Governmental Entities or
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any
such decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the
Transactions and the Company shall take any other actions and refrain from
taking any other actions that Parent is required to take or refrain from
taking pursuant to this _Section 5.05(b)_. Neither Parent nor Sub, directly
or indirectly, through one or more of their respective affiliates, shall
acquire or make any investment in any person or any division or assets
thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause a material delay in the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Section 6.01(b)_. Parent shall
have the sole and exclusive right to direct and control any litigation,
negotiation or other action, with counsel of its own choosing, in connection
with obtaining any approvals or consents that may be required under Antitrust
Laws to consummate the Transactions and the Company agrees to cooperate with
Parent with respect thereto.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.05_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly
inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other
parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In addition, except
as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding, each party
hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference with such Governmental Entity relating
to such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any such Governmental Entity in connection with
such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that documents and other materials described in this _Section
5.05(c)_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements or applicable Laws and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 



42 (d) To the extent not previously provided by the Company to Parent prior to
the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to Parent promptly after the date
hereof (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof)
the information, documents and materials reasonably requested by Parent prior
to the date hereof in order to determine whether any filing, clearance,
notice or approval under any Antitrust Law (each, a " _Competition Approval_
") (other than under the HSR Act or pursuant to the Antitrust Laws of the
jurisdictions set forth on  _Section 6.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter as of the date hereof) is required in connection with the Transactions.
Parent shall be entitled to request any additional information, documents and
materials that Parent believes in good faith are required in order to
determine whether any such Competition Approvals are required in connection
with the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such request shall be
made promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the
receipt of the information, documents and materials delivered by the Company
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence). The Company shall deliver to
Parent promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) the
information, documents and materials requested by Parent in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence. If the information, documents and
materials delivered pursuant to the first or third sentences of this 
_Section 5.05(d)_ are not consistent with, or reveal information that is
incremental to, the information, documents and materials delivered to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement and, solely due to such inconsistency or
new information, Parent or the Company determines in good faith within one
(1) Business Day following the receipt of the information, documents and
materials requested in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
that (x) a Competition Approval is required in a jurisdiction that is not
listed on _Section 6.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as of the date
of this Agreement and (y) the failure to obtain such Competition Approval in
such jurisdiction could result in material financial or material legal
consequences, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall give notice to the
other party of such determination and Parent and the Company shall negotiate
in good faith to amend or modify  _Section 6.01(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter in order to include such jurisdiction. Parent and the
Company agree that, so long as the Company has complied in all material
respects with its obligations pursuant to the preceding provisions of this
_Section 5.05(d)_, in no event shall any such notice be provided by Parent or
the Company at any time following the 12th Business Day after the date hereof.
If, following the receipt by Parent of the information, documents and
materials delivered pursuant to the first three sentences of this _Section
5.05(d)_, Parent or the Company determines in good faith that no Competition
Approval is required in a jurisdiction listed on _Section 6.01(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter as of the date hereof, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall give notice to the other party of such determination and
Parent and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to amend or modify
_Section 6.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in order to remove such
jurisdiction therefrom.

 

Section 5.06 _Financing_. (a) Parent and Sub shall not agree to any amendment
or modification to, or grant any waiver of, any provision under the Debt
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such
amendment, modification or waiver would (i) impose new or additional
conditions, or otherwise amend or modify any of the conditions in a manner
that is adverse to Parent, Sub or the Company, to the receipt of the Debt
Financing, (ii) delay or extend the timing of, or prevent or make less likely
to occur, the funding

 



43  of the commitments thereunder, (iii) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the
funding commitments thereunder, (iv) delay or prevent the Closing, (v) shorten
the period that the commitments are available thereunder, (vi) modify the
choice of law provisions with respect thereto or (vii) adversely impact the
ability of the Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or
the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(vii)_ , the "
_Prohibited Changes_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Sub shall be entitled to replace
the Debt Commitment Letter by entering into definitive documentation with
respect to the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing so long as such
definitive documentation is on terms and conditions consistent with the Debt
Commitment Letter and would not result in Prohibited Changes. Parent and Sub
acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder, including
their obligations to consummate the Transactions, are not subject to, or
conditioned on, receipt of the Debt Financing or any other financing. Neither
Parent nor Sub will prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, directly or indirectly, enter into an exclusivity, lock-up or other
similar agreement, arrangement or binding understanding with any bank or
investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing that
prohibits such provider from providing or seeking to provide services,
including debt or equity financing, to any third person in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including in
connection with the making of any Competing Proposal) in connection with
the Transactions.

(b) _Financing Assistance_. In connection with Parents financing in
connection with the Transaction (including the Debt Financing) (the " _Parent
Financing_ "), prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and
Sub, at Parents sole expense, customary cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent and Sub that is necessary in connection with the arrangement and
consummation of the Parent Financing, including (in each case, to the extent
reasonably requested):

 

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions between senior management and the sources of
the Parent Financing;

(ii) providing reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of
documents customarily required in connection with bank debt financings and,
to the extent required under the Debt Commitment Letter, providing all
documentation and other information relating to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries required thereunder (but subject to  _Section
5.06(c)_), including any documentation or other information reasonably
required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot
Act of 2001;

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining surveys,
legal opinions from local outside counsel (and not internal counsel or New
York or Delaware counsel) and title insurance as reasonably requested by
Parent or Sub for the Parent Financing; and

 

(iv) (A) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (1) permit the sources
involved in the Parent Financing to evaluate the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries current assets, and cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures relating

 



44  thereto, for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements to the
extent reasonable and customary, (2) establish customary bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the foregoing and (3) permit representatives of the
prospective lenders to conduct customary commercial field examinations,
customary inventory appraisals and a customary appraisal of the Owned
Real Property and (B) using commercially reasonable efforts to make audits
and appraisals delivered for purposes of any credit facility available to
Parent.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.06(b)_,
(i) nothing in this Agreement shall require any cooperation or other action
to the extent it would materially interfere with the business or operations of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take any
action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any
agreement or instrument) or that would be effective at or prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) the board of directors of the Company and the board
of directors (or other governing body) of any of the Company Subsidiaries

Company Subsidiaries). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with

with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or

45 Section 5.08 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each
fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and each such person who served at the request of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another
person or benefit plan fiduciary (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims,
damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding
sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on
or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer,
employee or fiduciary under benefit plans or served at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee
of another person or benefit plan fiduciary (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_
"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or
arise out of or pertain to the Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in
enforcing such persons rights under this _Section 5.08_. In the event of any
such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before
the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after
statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified
Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred
( _provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries
thereof than the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy; _provided_ that the Company shall not, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to, pay a premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as of the date of this
Agreement by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company may,
or Parent shall, obtain a policy which, in its good faith determination,
provides the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail" insurance policy, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long
thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) the Surviving Corporation

 



46  shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period (and for so long thereafter
as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are
being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that, in the case of _clause
(i)_ and _clause (ii)_ , Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay a premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid as of the date of this Agreement by the Company for such
insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the case of _clause (i)_ and
_clause (ii)_ , if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Parent shall obtain a policy which, in its good faith determination, provides
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 5.08_.

(d) _Continuation_. For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other similar documents) of each
Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for periods at or
prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in the Company Charter, the
Company By-Laws or the equivalent organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement.

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 5.08_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, each
Indemnified Partys heirs, executors or administrators, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without
the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and
heirs) affected thereby.

 

(f) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 5.08_ are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this _Section 5.08_, is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.08_ is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

Section 5.09 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall (a) take all action
necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the
Transactions and (b) if any Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any
of the Transactions, take all action necessary so that such Transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this

Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent
practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on such Transaction.

 



47 Section 5.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "),
Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide (i) base salary, wages and commission opportunities to
each individual who is an employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") at a rate that is no less favorable than the rate of base salary,
wages or commission opportunities provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual bonus opportunity to
each Company Employee that is not less favorable than the annual bonus
opportunity provided to such Company Employee for the calendar year in which

that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided under the
severance plan, policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iv) long-term incentive
compensation opportunities to each Company Employee that are substantially
comparable to the long-term incentive compensation opportunities provided to
such Company Employee for the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs, which may be provided in the form of equity-based awards, cash-based
awards or a combination thereof and (v) other compensation and benefits
(including paid-time off) to each Company Employee that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.10(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, honor and continue
all of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries Company Benefit Plans that
are employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies,
programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in control or
severance agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any
Company Employee), in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or to the extent amended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement as in effect prior to the
Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with
any other event).

 

(c) Under any "employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, but without regard to whether the applicable plan is subject to
ERISA) and any other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits
and vesting and, for purposes of vacation, paid time off and severance plans
only, benefit accrual, each Company Employees service with or otherwise
credited by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

 



48 (d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or cause to
be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

(e) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may implement a retention plan for the benefit of employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries which shall provide for retention
benefits to such employees in an aggregate amount not to exceed $18,000,000;
_provided_ that the Company shall inform Parent of the terms of any such
plan and any retention bonus opportunities granted under such plan.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
(i) be treated as an amendment or modification of any Company Benefit Plan,
(ii) give any employee or former employee or any other individual associated
therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other
third person any third-party beneficiary rights or other right to enforce the
provisions of this _Section 5.10_ or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit
plan, except in accordance with the terms of such plan or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee.

(g) The Company shall provide Parent, with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries

with a reasonable opportunity to review such communications prior to
distribution, and Parent shall not unreasonably delay its review of any such
proposed communication.

(or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or
officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy

that (i) the Company may, in its reasonable discretion, postpone or adjourn
the Company Meeting after consultation with Parent, (A) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy

amount of time in advance of the Company Meeting, (B) if as of the time for
which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy

under applicable Laws and (ii) the Company shall postpone or adjourn the
Company Meeting for any period of time necessary for the Company to comply

Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.03(f)_. Without limiting the

agreements contained in this Agreement is such that a condition contained in
_Section 6.02(a)_ or _Section 6.02(b)_ would not be satisfied.

 

Section 7.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent in accordance with _Section 7.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, Sub or the Company or their respective affiliates, officers, directors
or other representatives, in either case, except (i) with respect to,
the second sentence of _Section 5.04_, _Section 5.06(d)_, _Section 5.11_,
this _Section 7.02_ and _Article VIII_, which provisions shall survive such
termination and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any person from any
liability with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by
another party as a result of such persons fraud or the willful and material
breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by (A) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_ or (B) the Company pursuant

a Competing Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or shall have
become publicly known and not withdrawn, and (C) within twelve (12) months
after the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall have consummated a
Competing Proposal or entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any
Competing Proposal that is subsequently consummated (which Competing Proposal

immediately preceding _clause (B)_ ), then the Company shall pay to Parent or
its designee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after the
consummation of any such Competing Proposal the Company Termination Fee;
_provided_ , that for purposes of this  _Section 7.02(b)(ii)_, the term
"Competing Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term, except that
all references to "20%" therein shall be changed to "40%" and all references
to "80%" therein shall be changed to "60%".

 



55 (c) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the Transactions,
(ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company would not enter
into this Agreement and (iii) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that is intended to
compensate Parent and Sub in the circumstances in which such Company
Termination Fee is payable. In no event shall the Company be required to pay
to Parent more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
7.02(b)_. In the event that Parent receives full payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_ under circumstances where a
Company Termination Fee was payable, the receipt of the Company Termination
Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub, any of their respective
affiliates or any other person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination of this Agreement), the Merger and the Transactions (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. If
the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee when due and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment
against the Company or the payment of the Company Termination Fee the Company
shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred in connection therewith, together with interest
on the amount of such judgment or payment, from the date of the termination of
this Agreement that triggered the obligation to pay such Company Termination
Fee until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on
the date of such termination.

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. Subject to  _Section 5.08(e)_, this Agreement may
be amended by the Company, Parent and Sub by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires approval by the holders of
Shares without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.

Section 7.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of
the other contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or
conditions contained in this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after
the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, there may not be any
extension or waiver of this Agreement that decreases the Merger Consideration
or that adversely affects the rights of the holders of Shares
hereunder without the approval of the holders of Shares at a duly convened
meeting of the holders of Shares called to obtain approval of such extension
or waiver. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 8.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 8.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes,
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 8.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or

the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any

which shall, only after the Effective Time, be for the benefit of any person
entitled to payment thereunder and (b) _Section 5.08_, which shall, only
after the Effective Time, be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, such

Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , that the
persons named in _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ of this sentence shall be entitled
to enforce their rights under this Agreement. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third-party beneficiaries under _clauses (a)_ and
_(b)_ above shall not arise, and such persons shall not be third-party
beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in  _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_
above, unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this

 



58  Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the
sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties in accordance with
_Section 7.04_ without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties. Consequently, persons other
than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of
the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.07 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings_. Each party hereto
has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, unless the
context otherwise requires: (a) the singular number shall include the plural,
and vice versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and (d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine
genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
words of similar meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections,"
"Annexes" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement
and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. The term "or" shall
not be deemed to be exclusive. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. In
this Agreement, references to "as of the date of this Agreement", "as of the
date hereof" or words of similar import shall be deemed to mean "as of
immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement." The
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to a date or time shall be deemed
to be such date or time in Chicago, Illinois, unless otherwise specified.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to any Contract (including this
Agreement) or Law, such references are to, except as the context may otherwise
require, the Contract or Law as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or
replaced from time to time (in the case of a Contract, to the extent
permitted by the terms thereof) and in the case of any Law, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

Section 8.08 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of Law thereof.

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions brought by any other
party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the
Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County and any state appellate court
therefrom (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over any matter, any other Delaware state or federal court), and
each of the

 



59  parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties agrees not
to commence any such Proceeding except as and in the courts described above in
Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware
as described in this Agreement. Each of the parties further agrees that notice
delivered as provided in this Agreement shall constitute sufficient
service of process for purposes of any legal Proceeding brought by any party
or its affiliates or successors or assigns, and the parties further waive any
argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (i) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described in this Agreement for any reason (other than a failure to serve
process as described in the immediately preceding sentence), (ii) that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such
Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this
Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Parent further
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document on Parents
agent for service in the United States as designated by Parent shall be deemed
to be effective service of process in the courts described in the first
sentence of this  _Section 8.08_ for any legal Proceeding brought by the
Company against Parent in such courts arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY PROCEEDING SHALL
BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE
JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II)
IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(III) IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.08(c)_.

 

Section 8.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



60 Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which money damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to
be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Each of the parties agrees that, (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant
to this _Section 8.10_ shall not in any way constitute a waiver by any party
seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to it under this Agreement, including under _Section 7.02_,
in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 8.10_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require a
party to institute any Proceeding for (or limit a partys right to institute
any Proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 8.10_ prior, or
as a condition, to exercising any termination right under _Article VII_
(and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of
any Proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this _Section 8.10_ or anything
set forth in this _Section 8.10_ restrict or limit a partys right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter and (iii) no party shall require the other to post any bond or
other security as a condition to institute any Proceeding for specific
performance under this _Section 8.10_. Each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy
at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity.
