outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded
Shares, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
New Parent, Pace, U.S. Holdco, or Merger Sub or the holders of any Shares, be
converted into, and thereafter only evidence, the right to receive, without

(such shares the " _New Parent Ordinary Shares_ " and such consideration per
Share the " _Merger Consideration_ ") and all such Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
representing Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Share

being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

Section 4.4 Certificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate, (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall notify

such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,

representing the New Parent Ordinary Shares into which the Shares represented
by such holderยs Certificates were converted pursuant to _Section 4.2_, and

certificated book-entry form representing that number of New Parent Ordinary
Shares that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of each such
uncertificated Share pursuant to _Section 4.2_ and (ii) a check in an amount
of United States dollars equal to any cash dividends or other distributions
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 4.6_ less any
applicable withholding Taxes as provided in _Section 4.10_ and without
interest thereon.

Section 4.6 Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares;
Voting.

 

(a) All New Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by New Parent in respect of the New Parent
Ordinary Shares, the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
New Parent Ordinary Shares issued in the Merger. The Exchange Agent shall
hold any New Parent Ordinary Shares in respect of unsurrendered Certificates
in trust for the holder of such Certificate until such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.8_) has been
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article IV_. No dividends or
other distributions in respect of the New Parent Ordinary Shares shall be paid
to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.8_) has been
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article IV_. Subject to
applicable Law and the provisions of this _Article IV_ , following surrender
of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section 4.8_), there shall be delivered to the record holder of the
certificates representing shares of New Parent Ordinary Shares in exchange
therefor, and, after deduction for any applicable withholding Taxes as

theretofore paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such New Parent Ordinary
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time, but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender.

(b) Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to
direct the Exchange Agent how to vote the number of New Parent Ordinary Shares
represented by such unsurrendered Certificates at any meeting of New Parent
shareholders with a record date at or after the Effective Time, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.

 



5 Section 4.7 Transfers. From and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 4.8 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any New
Parent Ordinary Shares) which has not been transferred to the holders of
Shares as of the one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered
at the direction of U.S. Holdco to New Parent or its designee, upon demand.
Any holder of Certificates (as applicable) who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article IV_ prior to the one year anniversary of the Effective Time
shall thereafter look only to New Parent for delivery of New Parent
Ordinary Shares and payment of any dividends and other distributions in
respect thereof, in each case, less any applicable withholding Taxes as
provided in _Section 4.10_ and without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, New Parent, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

Section 4.9 Transferred Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and compliance with the
replacement requirements established by the Exchange Agent including, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by New Parent as
indemnity against any claim with respect to such Certificate that may be made
against it, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to such Person (or its designee) in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the New Parent Ordinary Shares and any
dividends and other distributions in respect of the New Parent Ordinary
Shares that would have been delivered pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article IV_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.
If delivery of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of delivery that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such delivery shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the record holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

Section 4.10 Withholding Rights. Each of New Parent, U.S. Holdco, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration or amount otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by New Parent, U.S.
Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. To the extent that the amount so required
to be deducted or withheld under applicable Tax Law from the payment of any
consideration

 



6  otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement exceeds the cash
consideration otherwise payable to such Person pursuant to this Agreement,
each of New Parent, U.S. Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, is hereby authorized to sell such portion
of the New Parent Ordinary Shares or other non-cash consideration otherwise
payable to such Person as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to enable

proceeding or investigation is pending, asserted or made either prior to the
Effective Time or within such six year period, all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses or exculpation required to be continued pursuant to
this _Section 7.6(a)_ in respect thereof shall continue until disposition
thereof.

 

(b) At and after the Effective Time, New Parent, U.S. Holdco and ARRIS shall,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of ARRIS or any
of its subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of ARRIS or
any of its subsidiaries (each, together with his or her respective heirs and
representatives, an " _ARRIS Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the "
_ARRIS Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses (including
advancing attorneysย fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
ARRIS Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time),
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to any action or omission in such personยs capacity as a director,
officer or employee of ARRIS or any of its subsidiaries or as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another company, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of
ARRIS or any of its subsidiaries, in each case occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or before the Effective Time (including actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, New Parent and U.S.
Holdco, respectively, shall cause to be maintained in effect (i) the coverage
provided by the policies of directorsย and officersย liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the Effective Time maintained by
ARRIS and its subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time (provided that New Parent and U.S. Holdco may substitute
therefor policies with a carrier with comparable credit ratings to the
existing carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions that are no less favorable to the insured) or (ii) a "tail"
policy (which ARRIS may purchase at its option prior to the Effective Time,
and, in such case, New Parent and ARRIS, respectively, shall cause such policy
to be in full force and effect, and shall cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by ARRIS) under ARRISยs existing directorsย and officersย insurance
policy that covers those persons who are currently covered by ARRISยs
directorsย and officersย insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for
actions and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, is from a
carrier with comparable credit

 



11  ratings to ARRISยs existing directorsย and officersย insurance policy
carrier and contains terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
insured than those of ARRISยs directorsย and officersย insurance policy in
effect as of the date hereof.

(d) The rights of each ARRIS Indemnified Party under this _Section 7.6_
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such ARRIS
Indemnified Party may have under the organizational documents of ARRIS or any
of its subsidiaries, as applicable, any agreement, any insurance policy,
Delaware law (or any other applicable Law) or otherwise. The provisions of
this _Section 7.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any ARRIS
Indemnified Party without the written consent of such affected ARRIS
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the ARRIS Indemnified
Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_ and shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section 7.6_). New
Parent and U.S. Holdco shall be jointly and severally responsible for paying
all reasonable expenses, including attorneysย fees, that may be incurred by
any ARRIS Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided for in this _Section 7.6_.

(e) In the event any of New Parent, U.S. Holdco or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys more than 50% of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of New Parent and/or U.S. Holdco, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_.
