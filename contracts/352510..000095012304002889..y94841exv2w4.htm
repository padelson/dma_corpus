</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of North Fork and GreenPoint have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their stockholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided
for herein in which GreenPoint will, subject to the terms and conditions set

surviving entity (the &#147;Merger&#148;);
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), for federal income tax purposes; and

and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section&nbsp;1.2 hereof), GreenPoint
shall merge with and into North Fork. North Fork shall be the surviving

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger (the &#147;Certificate of Merger&#148;) shall be duly prepared,
executed by North Fork as the Surviving Corporation and thereafter filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as provided in the Delaware

procedures&#148; (as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) reasonably designed and maintained to ensure that all information
(both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by North Fork in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to North Fork&#146;s management as appropriate to allow timely

specific authorizations, (ii)&nbsp;transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principals and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii)&nbsp;access

existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences. None of North Fork&#146;s or its Subsidiaries&#146; records,
systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained,
operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and

time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing
Date), each party will supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered
in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which,
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is
necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules which has
been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such
Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for the purpose of determining the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties contained in
Articles III and IV in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set
forth in Sections&nbsp;7.2(a) or 7.3(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the
compliance by GreenPoint or North Fork, as the case may be, with the respective
covenants and agreements of such parties contained herein. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no failure to advise the other
party of any change or event referred to in the first sentence of this Section
6.10, or any failure to provide any supplement or amendment referred to in the
second sentence of this Section&nbsp;6.10, shall constitute the failure of any
condition set forth in Article&nbsp;VII to be satisfied unless the underlying
Material Adverse Effect, breach or inaccuracy would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Article&nbsp;VII to be satisfied.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.11. Current Information. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, each party will cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with
representatives of the other party and to report the general status of the
ongoing operations of such party and its Subsidiaries. Each party will
promptly notify the other party of any material change in the normal course of
business or in the operation of the properties of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the
institution or the threat of significant litigation involving such party or any
of its Subsidiaries, and will keep the other party fully informed of such
events.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.12. Coordination of Dividends. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, GreenPoint and North Fork shall coordinate the declaration,

permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of
GreenPoint Common Stock and GreenPoint Stock Options into shares of North Fork
Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose

pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1(c) or North Fork shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1(e) or (f), (B)&nbsp;at any time after
the date of this Agreement and before such termination there shall
have been a Public Proposal with respect to GreenPoint that has
not been withdrawn prior to such termination, and (C)&nbsp;following
the occurrence of such Public Proposal, GreenPoint shall have
intentionally breached (and not cured after notice thereof) any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach shall have materially contributed
to the failure of the Effective Time to occur prior to the

such termination; and (D)&nbsp;if within eighteen (18)&nbsp;months of the
date of such termination of this Agreement, GreenPoint or any of
its Subsidiaries executes any definitive agreement with respect

shall pay the remaining two-thirds of the GreenPoint Termination
Fee upon the date of such execution or consummation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If GreenPoint fails to pay all amounts due to North Fork on the dates
specified, then GreenPoint shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred by North Fork in connection with any action or
proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such
unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime
lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal,
from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually
received by North Fork.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement.
