AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 15, 2004 (this "Agreement"), by and between North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("North Fork") and GreenPoint Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation ("GreenPoint").  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of North Fork and GreenPoint have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which GreenPoint will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into North Fork, with North Fork being the surviving entity (the "Merger");  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for federal income tax purposes; and  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER   

 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), GreenPoint shall merge with and into North Fork. North Fork shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be "North Fork Bancorporation, Inc." Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of GreenPoint shall terminate.  

 1.2. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed by North Fork as the Surviving Corporation and thereafter filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such time thereafter as is provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").  

 1.3. Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.   ##### 

 

 1.4. Conversion of GreenPoint Common Stock. (a) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of GreenPoint (the "GreenPoint Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of GreenPoint Common Stock (x) held in GreenPoints treasury or (y) held by North Fork or GreenPoint (except for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares (as such terms are defined in Section 1.4(b) hereof)), shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for 1.0514 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of North Fork (the "North Fork Common Stock"). All of the shares of GreenPoint Common Stock converted into North Fork Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1.4(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (each, a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares of GreenPoint Common Stock shall thereafter only represent the right to receive (i) the number of whole shares of North Fork Common Stock and (ii) the cash in lieu of any fractional shares into which the shares of GreenPoint Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(a) and Section 2.2(e) hereof; subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by GreenPoint on such shares of GreenPoint Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Certificates previously representing shares of GreenPoint Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of North Fork Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of North Fork Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar changes in capitalization, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted.  

 (b) At the Effective Time, all shares of GreenPoint Common Stock that are owned by GreenPoint as treasury stock and all shares of GreenPoint Common Stock that are owned by North Fork or GreenPoint (other than shares of GreenPoint Common Stock (x) held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties (any such shares, and shares of North Fork Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by North Fork or GreenPoint, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") or (y) held by North Fork or GreenPoint or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares of GreenPoint Common Stock, and shares of North Fork Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by North Fork or GreenPoint, being referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of North Fork, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of North Fork Common Stock that are owned     #####

 2.1. North Fork to Make Shares Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, North Fork shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company (which may be a Subsidiary of North Fork) (the "Exchange Agent") selected by North Fork and reasonably acceptable to GreenPoint, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of North Fork Common Stock and the cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of North Fork Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof in exchange for outstanding shares of GreenPoint Common Stock.  

 2.2. Exchange of Shares. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a customary form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of North Fork Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of GreenPoint Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of North Fork Common Stock to which such holder of GreenPoint Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I hereof and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (after taking into account all shares of GreenPoint Common Stock then held by such holder), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.  

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to North Fork Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder     ##### 

    

thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of North Fork Common Stock represented
by such Certificate. No holder of an unsurrendered Certificate shall be
entitled, until the surrender of such Certificate, to vote the shares of
North Fork Common Stock into which his GreenPoint Common Stock shall have
been converted.  

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of North Fork Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of North Fork Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. North Fork or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Exchange Fund otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as North Fork or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by North Fork or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of GreenPoint Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by North Fork or the Exchange Agent.   

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of GreenPoint of the shares of GreenPoint Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent or North Fork, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of North Fork Common Stock and any related payments as provided in this Article II.   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of North Fork Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to North Fork Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of North Fork. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, North Fork shall pay to each former stockholder of GreenPoint who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of North Fork Common Stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale prices of North Fork Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") as reported     ##### 

    

by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding
the date on which the Effective Time shall occur by (ii) the fraction of a
share of North Fork Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4(a) hereof.  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of GreenPoint for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to North Fork. Any stockholders of GreenPoint who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to North Fork for payment of their shares of North Fork Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on North Fork Common Stock deliverable in respect of each Certificate such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of North Fork, GreenPoint, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of GreenPoint Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   

 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by North Fork, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as North Fork may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of North Fork Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
Merger and each party shall furnish all information concerning it and the

the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
North Fork Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to either of the parties, or their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either
party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of North Fork and GreenPoint.

In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties or Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 (c) North Fork and GreenPoint shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of North Fork, GreenPoint or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    ##### 

  

  

 (d) North Fork and GreenPoint shall promptly furnish each other with copies of written communications received by North Fork or GreenPoint, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 6.2. No Solicitation. (a) Each of GreenPoint and its Subsidiaries and North Fork and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by any of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries) shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither party shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed to facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any representative of a party, whether or not such representative is so authorized and whether or not such representative is purporting to act on behalf of such party or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by such party.   

 (b) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of each party shall be permitted, prior to its respective meeting of stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.4, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.2 and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less favorable to such party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.3(c)), to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person made after the date of this Agreement to the extent that such partys Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law.    

 (ii) Each party shall notify the other party promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to such party or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that informs such party or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in    ##### 

  

   

writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of
any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing
and any related documentation or correspondence). Each party shall also
promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify the other party, orally
and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person
in accordance with this Section 6.2(b) and keep the other party informed of
the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions
or negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all
material documentation or correspondence relating thereto.    

 (iii) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit either party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement, including Section 8.5.   

 (c) Each of North Fork and GreenPoint agrees that (i) it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, agents, representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) it will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.   

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall (x) permit either party to terminate this Agreement or (y) affect any other obligation of the parties under this Agreement. Neither party shall submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.   

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing from any person relating to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes a substantial portion of the net revenues, net income or assets of GreenPoint or any of its significant subsidiaries (as defined under Regulation S-X of the SEC), or North Fork or any of its significant subsidiaries, as the case may be, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of equity securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of GreenPoint or any of its significant subsidiaries, or North Fork or any of its significant subsidiaries, as the case may be, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of the voting power of GreenPoint or North Fork, as the case may be, or (z) merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving GreenPoint or North Fork or any of their respective    ##### 

  

 

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any transaction by North Fork permitted by
Section 5.2(b) hereof.    

 6.3. Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, GreenPoint shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of North Fork, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such period, GreenPoint shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to North Fork (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal securities laws or Federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents which GreenPoint is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as North Fork may reasonably request. Neither GreenPoint nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of GreenPoints customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.   

 (b) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, North Fork shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of GreenPoint, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to such information, properties and personnel regarding North Fork and its Subsidiaries as shall be reasonably necessary for GreenPoint to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or that may be reasonably necessary for GreenPoint to confirm that the representations and warranties of North Fork contained herein are true and correct and that the covenants of North Fork contained herein have been performed in all material respects. Neither North Fork nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of North Forks customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.   

 (c) All information furnished by either party to the other party or its representatives pursuant hereto shall be subject to, and the parties shall hold such information in confidence in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated as of January 28, 2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between GreenPoint and North Fork.    ##### 

  

  

 (d) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth herein.   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, North Fork and GreenPoint (and each of their respective employees, representatives, or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all materials of any kind that are provided relating to such tax treatment or tax structure; provided, however, that neither North Fork nor GreenPoint (nor any of their respective employees, representatives or other agents thereof) may disclose any information to the extent that such disclosure could reasonably result in a violation of any federal or state securities law.   

 6.4. Stockholder Meetings. Each of GreenPoint and North Fork shall take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (in the case of GreenPoint, the "GreenPoint Stockholders Meeting" and, in the case of North Fork, the "North Fork Stockholders Meeting") to be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after the date on which the Form S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of GreenPoint and North Fork will, through its Board of Directors, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of its respective stockholders in respect of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of GreenPoint and North Fork at such meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve GreenPoint and North Fork of such obligations.   

 6.5 Affiliates.

 6.6. Stock Exchange Listing. North Fork shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of North Fork Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as of the Effective Time.   

 6.7. Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements. (a) Following the Effective Time, North Fork shall continue to provide to individuals who are employed by GreenPoint and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain employed with North Fork or any Subsidiary of North Fork ("Affected Employees"), for so long as such Affected Employees remain employed by North Fork or any Subsidiary of North Fork, employee benefits (i) pursuant to the Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements    ##### 

  

 

maintained by North Fork or any Subsidiary of North Fork provided to
similarly situated employees of North Fork (it being understood that
inclusion of Affected Employees in the employee benefit plans of North Fork
or a Subsidiary of North Fork may occur at different times with respect to
different plans) on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of North Fork.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each Affected
Employee whose employment is terminated during the one-year period following
the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive severance pay and benefits
pursuant to the terms of the GreenPoint GP Severance Policy under Change in
Control as in effect on the date hereof, a true and correct copy of which is
attached to Section 6.7 of the GreenPoint Disclosure Schedule.    

 (b) North Fork shall, or shall cause GreenPoint to, give Affected Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits under (but not for accrual of pension benefits except as provided below with respect to a cash balance pension plan) any employee benefit and compensation plans or arrangements maintained by North Fork or any Subsidiary of North Fork for such Affected Employees service with GreenPoint or any Subsidiary of GreenPoint (or any predecessor entity) to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any comparable employee benefit plan of GreenPoint or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of any cash balance pension plan maintained or contributed to by North Fork or any of its Subsidiaries in which Affected Employees become eligible to participate following the Effective Time (excluding the cash balance pension plan maintained or sponsored by GreenPoint or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time), the Affected Employees level of benefit accruals under any such plans (for periods of service following the date on which the Affected Employees commence participation in such plans) shall be determined based on the Affected Employees credited service prior to the Effective Time (as recognized for the same purpose by GreenPoint for purposes of the cash balance pension plan maintained or sponsored by GreenPoint or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time) and with North Fork and any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.   

 (c) North Fork shall, or shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of North Fork and GreenPoint to, (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time (or date of participation in any such plan if later) under any comparable welfare plan maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (or date of participation in any such plan if later), and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (or date of participation in any such plan if later) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time (or date of participation in any such plan if later) occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time (or date of participation in any such plan if later).    ##### 

  

  

 (d) Following the Effective Time, North Fork shall honor, fulfill and discharge and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of North Fork to honor, fulfill and discharge in accordance with their terms the Plans (as in effect as of Effective Time) which have been disclosed in the GreenPoint Disclosure Schedule and previously have been made available or delivered to North Fork; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent North Fork from amending or terminating any Plans in accordance with the terms of such Plans.   

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, GreenPoint shall adopt a resolution providing for the termination of the ESOP effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the occurrence thereof. In connection with such termination, after the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the ESOP, the trustee shall sell a number of shares sufficient to repay in full the outstanding acquisition loans of the ESOP. All shares of North Fork Common Stock and cash held by the ESOP after repayment of such loan shall be allocated to the accounts of the eligible participants of the ESOP in accordance with its terms. Prior to the Effective Time, North Fork shall take the action necessary (including the amendment of North Forks 401(k) Plan) to permit the Affected Employees to roll any eligible rollover distributions from the ESOP into North Forks 401(k) Plan.   

 (f) North Fork shall take all necessary action to effectuate the agreements set forth in Section 6.7(f) of the GreenPoint Disclosure Schedule.   

 6.8. Indemnification. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of GreenPoint or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of GreenPoint or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of GreenPoint or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, North Fork shall indemnify and hold harmless each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent provided by applicable law, the certificate of incorporation of GreenPoint and the bylaws of GreenPoint.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) North Fork shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of GreenPoint immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by GreenPoint (provided that North Fork may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event shall North Fork be required to expend on an annual basis more than 250% of the current amount expended by GreenPoint (the "Insurance Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage, and further provided that if North Fork is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.8(b) North Fork shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.   

 (c) In the event North Fork or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of North Fork assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   

 6.9. Reasonable Best Efforts; Additional Agreements. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of North Fork and GreenPoint agrees to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger, including using reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger.   

 (b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by North Fork.   

 (c) North Fork and GreenPoint shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Officers of North Fork and GreenPoint shall execute and deliver to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, counsel to GreenPoint, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, counsel to North Fork, certificates containing appropriate representations at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such law firms,    ##### 

  

 

including the effective date of the Form S-4 and the Effective Time, in
connection with their respective deliveries of opinions with respect to the
Tax treatment of the Merger.    

 (d) GreenPoint shall consult with North Fork prior to sending any written communications to its employees regarding the Merger or this Agreement.   

 6.10. Advice of Changes. North Fork and GreenPoint shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing Date), each party will supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties contained in Articles III and IV in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance by GreenPoint or North Fork, as the case may be, with the respective covenants and agreements of such parties contained herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no failure to advise the other party of any change or event referred to in the first sentence of this Section 6.10, or any failure to provide any supplement or amendment referred to in the second sentence of this Section 6.10, shall constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect, breach or inaccuracy would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.   

 6.11. Current Information. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with representatives of the other party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of such party and its Subsidiaries. Each party will promptly notify the other party of any material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties of such party or any of its Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of significant litigation involving such party or any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep the other party fully informed of such events.   

 6.12. Coordination of Dividends. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, GreenPoint and North Fork shall coordinate the declaration, record and payment dates with respect to dividends in respect of GreenPoint Common Stock and North Fork Common Stock, it being the intention of the parties that the holders of GreenPoint Common Stock shall not receive more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of GreenPoint    ##### 

  

 

Common Stock and any shares of North Fork Common Stock any holder of
GreenPoint Common Stock receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.    

 6.13. Directorships. Effective as of the Effective Time, North Fork shall cause its Board of Directors to be expanded by five members and shall appoint Thomas S. Johnson, Bharat B. Bhatt and three additional members of the existing GreenPoint Board of Directors who are reasonably agreed to by North Fork and GreenPoint to fill such vacancies. The additional directors shall be apportioned among the North Fork board classes as the parties may reasonably agree.   

 6.14. Registration. At or prior to the Effective Time, North Fork shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of North Fork Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of GreenPoint Options and settlement or distribution of the converted GreenPoint Awards and promptly (and in any event no later than seven business days after the Effective Time) file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor and other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of North Fork Common Stock subject to GreenPoint Options and settlement or distribution of the converted GreenPoint Awards. North Fork shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration for as long as any GreenPoint Options remain outstanding.   

 6.15. Section 16 Matters. North Fork and GreenPoint agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain GreenPoint Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that GreenPoint Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of GreenPoint Common Stock and GreenPoint Stock Options into shares of North Fork Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.15. Assuming that GreenPoint delivers to North Fork the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of North Fork, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by GreenPoint Insiders of North Fork Common Stock in exchange for shares of GreenPoint Common Stock, and of options on North Fork Common Stock upon conversion of options on GreenPoint Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. In addition, the Board of Directors of GreenPoint, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by GreenPoint Insiders of GreenPoint Common Stock in exchange for shares of North Fork Common Stock, and of GreenPoint Options upon conversion into options on North Fork Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding GreenPoint Insiders, the number of shares of GreenPoint Common Stock held by each such GreenPoint Insider and expected    ##### 

  

 

to be exchanged for North Fork Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and
description of the options on GreenPoint Common Stock held by each such
GreenPoint Insider and expected to be converted into options on North
Fork Common Stock in connection with the Merger; provided that the
requirement for a description of any GreenPoint Stock Options shall be deemed
to be satisfied if copies of all GreenPoint Stock Plans, and forms of
agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such GreenPoint Stock
Options have been granted, have been made available to North Fork.
"GreenPoint Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of GreenPoint
who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.    

 6.16. GreenPoint Bank to be Held Separate. The parties intend that, from and after the Effective Time, GreenPoint Bank shall continue its existence as a subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, separate and distinct from North Fork Bank. At the Effective time, the Board of Directors of GreenPoint Bank shall consist of such persons as shall be reasonably agreed to by GreenPoint and North Fork.

 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT    

 8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of GreenPoint and North Fork:   

 (a) by mutual consent of GreenPoint and North Fork in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board;   

 (b) by either North Fork or GreenPoint upon written notice to the other party (i) 60 days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been denied by the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the legally prescribed period following such denial a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity; provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) if such denial, or if such failure to file, shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;   

 (c) by either North Fork or GreenPoint if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2004, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;    ##### 

  

  

 (d) by either GreenPoint or North Fork (provided that the party terminating shall not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 6.4) if any approval of the stockholders of GreenPoint or North Fork required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at a duly held meeting of such stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;   

 (e) by either North Fork or GreenPoint (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 7.2(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by GreenPoint) or Section 7.3(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by North Fork);   

 (f) by either North Fork or GreenPoint (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) unless the breach of covenant, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party entitled to the benefit of such covenant not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 7.2(b) (in the case of a breach of covenant by GreenPoint) or Section 7.3(b) (in the case of a breach of covenant by North Fork); or

 8.2. Effect of Termination.

At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of its agreements contained herein, or waive compliance with any of the conditions to its obligations hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
