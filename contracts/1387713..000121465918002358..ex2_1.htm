and such amended bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

SECTION 1.06 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case

SECTION 1.07 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub or the holder of any Equity Interests of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:

  

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Company Common
Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries_. Each share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by the Company, each Company Subsidiary, Parent, Merger Sub and each
other Subsidiary of Parent shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (excluding shares to be canceled or to be converted in
accordance with _Section 1.07(b)_ and, except as provided in _Section
1.07(d)_, Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $0.84
(eighty-four cents) in cash, net of applicable withholding Taxes and without
interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.08_,
net of applicable withholding Taxes and without interest.

  

     

4

 

  

  

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262
of the DGCL (" _Section 262_", and such shares of Company Common Stock, "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.07(c)_, but instead shall
entitle the holder thereof only to those rights expressly provided by Section
262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262, then the right of such holder to receive those rights under Section 262
shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive,
the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.07(c)_, net of
applicable withholding Taxes and without interest. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of any shares of Company Common Stock, and prior to the Effective Time Parent
shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make, or agree
to make, any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands for appraisal or payment, or purport to waive any Person's failure to
timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or to take any other action
necessary to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL.

  

  

(e) _Effect on Company Warrants_. Each issued and outstanding vested Company
Warrant that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such vested Company Warrant (solely to the extent vested) that is less than
the Per Share Merger Consideration, shall be converted into the right to
receive, with respect to each such share of Company Common Stock subject to
such vested Company Warrant (solely to the extent vested), an amount equal to
(i) the Per Share Merger Consideration, _minus_ (y) exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such vested Company Warrant (solely to the
extent vested). As of the Effective Time, all Company Warrants shall no longer
be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Company
Warrants shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except, solely
with respect to the vested Company Warrants contemplated by the foregoing
sentence, the right to receive the applicable cash amount set forth in the
foregoing sentence, net of applicable withholding Taxes and without interest.

  


 

 

  

 

SECTION 1.08 _Payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration_.

  


 

 

  

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of Company Common Stock in
accordance with this _Article I_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash necessary to pay for
the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to _Section 1.07(c)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

     

5

 

  

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure for Company Common Stock_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two Business
Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Certificates_
") or Book-Entry Shares which were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.07(c)_: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as are customary and reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Company Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation in the case of Company Stock
Certificates, or receipt of an "agent's message" (or such other evidence or
instruction of transfer, if any, as the Paying Agent shall reasonably request)
in the case of Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in each case together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Company Stock Certificate or such Book-Entry
Shares shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.07(c)_, and any
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Stock Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered only if, in the case of a
Company Stock Certificate, if such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or, in the case of a
Book-Entry Share, a proper transfer instruction is presented, and in either
case the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Company Common Stock or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 1.08_, each Company Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, net of applicable
withholding Taxes and without interest, into which the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Stock Certificate or such
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to _Section
1.07(c)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

  

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 6-month anniversary of the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common
Stock entitled to payment of Per Share Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

  

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Company Stock
Certificate (or an affidavit in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section
1.08(f)_) or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the date on
which the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Per Share Merger Consideration
in respect of such Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such date become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, subject to the claims of any former
holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Per Share Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this _Article I_.

  

     

6

 

  

  

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. In no event,
however, shall such investment or any such payment of interest or income delay
the receipt by former holders of Company Common Stock of the Per Share Merger
Consideration. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the Per
Share Merger Consideration to all holders of Company Common Stock, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such payments.

  

  

(f) _Lost Company Stock Certificates_. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Stock Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

  

  

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Per Share
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ as
a result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

  

  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  

  

(i) _Tax Treatment_. To the extent that any part of the Per Share Merger
Consideration is funded with any cash of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, such cash shall be used to redeem issued and outstanding Company
Common Stock of the holders of Company Common Stock who held such shares
immediately prior to the Merger, and any such redemption shall be treated as
an exchange under Section 302 of the Code for all federal, state, and local
Tax purposes.

  

     

7

 

  

  

(j) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
including _Section 4.01_, in the event that between the date of this Agreement
and immediately prior to the Effective Time, there is a change in the number
of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, or
other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted by
Parent to reflect the effect thereof.
