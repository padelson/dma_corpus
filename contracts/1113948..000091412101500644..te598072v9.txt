PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 7, 2001, by and among
TeleCorp PCS, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TeleCorp"), ATandT; Wireless
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AWS") and TL Acquisition Corp., a
newly formed Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
AWS ("Merger Sub").    WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of TeleCorp, AWS and Merger Sub, as well as all of the directors of
TeleCorp who are not employees of AWS (the "Disinterested Directors"), have
approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders to consummate the merger of Merger Sub with and
into TeleCorp on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (the
"Merger");   WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it
is intended that either the Merger or the combination of the Merger and
the Follow-On Merger, as applicable, qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;   
WHEREAS, as an inducement to and a condition to AWS entering into this
Agreement, simultaneously herewith certain stockholders of TeleCorp
are entering into Voting Agreements relating to the agreement of such
stockholders to vote to approve the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Voting Agreements"); and    NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein contained, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the
Effective Time and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
("DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into TeleCorp, with TeleCorp as
the surviving corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and TeleCorp, as the surviving
corporation, shall continue its existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of AWS. TeleCorp, as the surviving
corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."   1.2 Effective Time. As soon as practicable after
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article V (excluding, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of, conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied prior to the
Closing Date), but in no event prior to the Closing, TeleCorp and AWS shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL
(the date and time of such filing, or such later date and time as may be
specified by mutual agreement in the Certificate of Merger, being the
"Effective Time").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and the Certificate of Merger. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the assets,
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of TeleCorp
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of TeleCorp and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of any
party, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of TeleCorp shall be amended
to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the
corporation shall remain TeleCorp, and the provision relating to the
incorporator shall be omitted) and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as
provided by the DGCL; provided that, if the votes received in connection with
the Required Stockholder Approval are not sufficient under the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of TeleCorp to cause such amendment, then the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of TeleCorp as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL.
At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL.  
1.5 Directors and Officers.   (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving
Corporation\'s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.   (b) The officers
of TeleCorp immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of Merger Sub until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with Merger Sub\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.   1.6 Conversion of Capital Stock,

holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive shares of the
applicable AWS Capital Stock as specified in Section 1.6 (the "Merger
Consideration"), and any cash, in lieu of fractional shares to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate
in accordance with Section 1.10 hereof without interest. The number of shares
of AWS Capital Stock into which shares of each class of TeleCorp Capital
Stock are converted in accordance with Section 1.6 shall be, with respect to
such class, the "Exchange Ratio."   1.7 Cancellation of Certain Shares;
Conversion of Merger Sub Stock.   (a) At the Effective Time, each share of

without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be delivered in

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
1.8 Stock Options; Restricted Stock.   (a) At the Effective Time, all
options (the "Outstanding Employee Options") to purchase shares of TeleCorp
Common Stock then outstanding and unexercised under the TeleCorp PCS, Inc.
2000 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan, the TeleCorp PCS, Inc.
1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended to the date hereof, the Amended and
Restated Tritel, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan, and the Amended and Restated
Tritel, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan for Non-employee Directors (the "TeleCorp
Option Plans"), whether or not then vested or exercisable, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall no
longer be options to acquire TeleCorp Common Stock and shall automatically
become options to acquire AWS Common Stock with such terms as provided in
Section 1.8(b).   (b) At the Effective Time, each such Outstanding Employee
Option shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the TeleCorp Option Plans, option agreements
thereunder and other relevant documentation immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that such Outstanding Employee Options will cease to
represent an option to purchase shares of TeleCorp Common Stock and will be
automatically converted into an option to purchase that number of whole
shares of AWS Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of TeleCorp Common Stock that were purchasable under such Outstanding
Employee Options immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
applicable Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares
of AWS Common Stock. The per-share exercise price for the shares of AWS
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such converted Outstanding Employee
Options will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise
price per share of TeleCorp Common Stock at which such Outstanding Employee
Options were exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
applicable Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price to
the nearest whole cent.   (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of
restricted and unvested TeleCorp Common Stock ("Restricted Shares") granted
under any of the TeleCorp Option Plans or otherwise, which are outstanding
and subject to restriction as of the Effective Time, shall, without any
further action on the part of the holders thereof, automatically and
immediately be converted into a number of restricted shares of AWS Common
Stock ("AWS Restricted Shares") equal to the product of (i) the number of
Restricted Shares held by the grantee immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the applicable Exchange Ratio. Following the Effective Time, each
AWS Restricted Share will otherwise continue to be subject to the same terms
and conditions set forth in the TeleCorp Option Plans, restricted stock
agreements thereunder and any other relevant documentation immediately prior
to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, AWS shall assume all of the
further obligations of TeleCorp under the TeleCorp PCS, Inc. 1998 Restricted
Stock Plan, which was assumed by TeleCorp on November 13, 2000.   (d) AWS or
one of its Affiliates shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of AWS Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Outstanding Employee
Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, AWS shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form or other
appropriate form) under the Securities Act covering the shares of AWS Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Outstanding Employee Options assumed
by AWS, and shall use all its reasonable efforts to cause such registration
statement to become effective as soon thereafter as practicable and to
maintain such registration in effect until the exercise or expiration of
such assumed Outstanding Employee Options.   (e) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the number of shares and the per share exercise price of each
Outstanding Employee Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option
" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance
with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code.   (f) TeleCorp shall take
all steps necessary prior to the Effective Time to ensure that no individual
shall have the right to exercise any Outstanding Employee Options (or other
TeleCorp equity awards) for TeleCorp Common Stock following the Effective
Time.   1.9 Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (a) any change in the
outstanding shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock or AWS Common Stock shall occur
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any similar transaction,
or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or (b)
if the representations set forth in Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) or the
first sentence of Section 2.3(c) shall not be true and correct and, solely in
the case of clause (b) AWS elects to do so, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of TeleCorp Capital
Stock or AWS, as the case may be, the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event or in the absence of such failure to be
true and correct, as the case may be.   1.10 Fractional Shares. No fraction
of a share of AWS Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof each
holder of shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
a fraction of a share of AWS Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of AWS Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from
the Exchange Agent (as defined below) in lieu of such fractional shares of
AWS Common Stock, an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent and
without interest) representing such holder\'s proportionate interest, if any,
in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more
transactions (which sale transactions shall be made at such times, in such
manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its
reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such holders of the aggregate of the
fractional shares of AWS Common Stock which would otherwise have been issued
(the "Excess Shares"). The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent
shall be executed on the New York Stock Exchange and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of TeleCorp Capital Stock, the
Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of
TeleCorp Capital Stock. AWS shall pay or cause to be paid all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including, without
limitation, the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in
connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. AWS may decide, at its sole
option, exercised prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of the issuance and
sale of Excess Shares that AWS shall pay or cause to be paid to the Exchange
Agent an amount sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each holder of
TeleCorp Capital Stock the amount such holder would have received pursuant to
the foregoing assuming that the sales of AWS Common Stock were made at a
price equal to the average of the closing bid prices of AWS Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange, for the ten consecutive trading days immediately
following the Effective Time and, in such case, all references herein to the
cash proceeds of the sale of the Excess Shares and similar references shall
be deemed to mean and refer to the payments calculated as set forth in this
sentence. In such event, Excess Shares shall not be issued or otherwise
transferred to the Exchange Agent. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
TeleCorp Capital Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of AWS Common Stock,
the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders
of shares of the applicable TeleCorp Capital Stock without interest.   1.11
Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective
Time, AWS shall designate a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") in connection with the Merger.   (b) AWS to Provide
Capital Stock. When and as needed, AWS shall use reasonable best efforts to
make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
Article I, through such reasonable procedures as AWS may adopt, the Merger
Consideration.   (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than five days after the Effective Time), AWS shall
cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
(the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive shares of AWS Capital Stock pursuant to
Section 1.6, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as TeleCorp may reasonably specify) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of AWS Capital Stock. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
the number and type of shares of AWS Capital Stock or, as the case may be,
payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.10, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate
that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of TeleCorp Capital
Stock shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
legal purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the number of shares of
AWS Capital Stock into which the holder of such shares of TeleCorp Capital
Stock is entitled and, as the case may be, the right to receive an amount in
cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with
Section 1.10. Any portion of the shares of AWS Capital Stock and cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.11(b) which remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates representing shares of TeleCorp
Capital Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
AWS, upon demand, and any holders of shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock who
have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Article I shall
thereafter look only to AWS and only as general creditors thereof for payment
of their claim for AWS Capital Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
and any dividends or distributions with respect to AWS Capital Stock to which
such holders may then be entitled.   (d) Distributions With Respect to
Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the Effective Time with respect to AWS Capital Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of AWS Capital Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following the surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing shares of AWS Capital Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of AWS Capital Stock.   (e) Transfers of
Ownership. If any certificate for shares of AWS Capital Stock is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered in the stock register of TeleCorp, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed and otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that
the stockholder requesting such exchange shall have paid to AWS, or any agent
designated by it, any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of AWS Capital Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or established to the reasonable satisfaction of AWS or any agent designated
by it that such tax has been paid or is otherwise not payable.   (f) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of the Exchange Agent, AWS or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a
holder of shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock or any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (g) Withholding of Tax. Either AWS or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of TeleCorp
Capital Stock such amounts as AWS (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange
Agent shall determine in good faith they are required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
any applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by AWS or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by AWS.   1.12 Further Ownership Rights in Shares.
All shares of AWS Capital Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article
I (including any cash paid in respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
TeleCorp Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of either AWS or the Surviving Corporation of shares
of capital stock of TeleCorp which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
either AWS or the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.13 Closing. Unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, and
subject to the provisions of Article V, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (eastern standard time) on a date
(the "Closing Date") to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, which date
shall be not later than the third business day after all the conditions set
forth in Article V (excluding, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of,
conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied prior to the Closing
Date) shall have been satisfied or waived, unless another time and/or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties. The Closing shall take place at
the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York,
NY, unless another place is agreed to by the parties.   1.14 Lost, Stolen
or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates evidencing shares of
TeleCorp Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof in form and substance reasonably acceptable to AWS, such shares of
AWS Capital Stock to which the holder of such Certificate would otherwise be
entitled to pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.6 and cash for fractional
shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.10; provided,
however, that AWS may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against AWS or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.   1.15 Follow-On Merger. In the event that either of
the tax opinions required by Section 5.2(b) and 5.3(b) could otherwise not be
delivered, AWS shall cause the Surviving Corporation to be merged with and
into AWS immediately after the Effective Time (the "Follow-On Merger").  
1.16 Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of TeleCorp Capital Stock (other than the
TeleCorp Class A Voting Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share) that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.11,
of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares.  
(b) TeleCorp shall give AWS (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by TeleCorp, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by TeleCorp and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. TeleCorp shall not, except with the prior
written consent of AWS, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.    ARTICLE II

Agreement Amendment"), and the Transfer Agreement (collectively, the "Related
Agreements") and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and,
assuming the requisite stockholder approval is received, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by
TeleCorp of this Agreement and each Related Agreement to which it is a party,
the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the
consummation by TeleCorp of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
have been duly and validly authorized by all corporate action and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of TeleCorp are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or any Related Agreement or to consummate the transactions so
contemplated, other than the Required Stockholder Approval. Each of this
Agreement and each Related Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by TeleCorp and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery thereof by all other parties to each such agreement, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of TeleCorp in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws relating to or affecting creditors generally or by general equitable
principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or law).   2.5 Board Recommendation; Required Vote. A
majority of the Disinterested Directors have, and the full Board of Directors
of TeleCorp has, at a meeting duly called and held (i) approved and declared

resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement, the Merger, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to the stockholders of TeleCorp
and (iv) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of

the only votes of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
TeleCorp necessary to approve and authorize this Agreement, the Merger and
the Related Agreements and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby in their capacity as stockholders of TeleCorp (such vote, the
"Required Stockholder Approval"). As of the date hereof, the Persons who are
signatories to the Voting Agreements in the aggregate possess sufficient
voting power to cause the Required Stockholder Approval to be given without
the vote of any other stockholder of TeleCorp. The Stockholders Agreement
Amendment was and is effective to amend the Stockholders Agreement in the
manner and to the extent provided for in the Stockholders
Agreement Amendment.   2.6 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.  
(a) The execution and delivery by TeleCorp of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate
of Incorporation or By-laws or other equivalent organizational or
constitutive documents of TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict
with or violate any Law, Regulation or Order in each case applicable to
TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach or violation
of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or impair TeleCorp\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the
properties or assets of TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which TeleCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries or
its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except in the
case of clauses (ii) or (iii) above, for any such conflicts, breaches,
violations, defaults or other occurrences that would not (x) individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse
Effect, (y) prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements or (z)
individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the value of TeleCorp\'s Capital Stock.   (b) The
execution and delivery by TeleCorp of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements, will not, require TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries to
obtain any approval of any Person or approval of, observe any waiting period
imposed by, or make any filing with or notification to or seek any approval
or authorization from any Governmental Authority, domestic or foreign, except
for (i) compliance with applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the pre-merger notification
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act"), the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
including, without limitation, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of
1996 (the "Communications Act") and any rules, regulations or policies
promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), state
public utility, telecommunications or public service laws, (ii) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL and/or (iii) where the
failure to obtain such approvals, or to make such filings or notifications,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect. The approval or authorization required to
be obtained from the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act and/or the rules
and regulations of the FCC, are referred to herein as the "Required TeleCorp
Governmental Approvals").   2.7 Material Agreements. (a) Each agreement,
contract or commitment that is of a type which is required, pursuant to Items
404 or 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), to be disclosed or included as an exhibit to a
TeleCorp SEC Report filed on or after December 31, 2000 has been so disclosed
or so included in TeleCorp\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000, or one of its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended March 31, 2001 or June 30, 2001 (any such agreement required
to be so disclosed or included, together with any agreements actually
disclosed or included, the "TeleCorp SEC Agreements"). Except as entered into
after the date hereof without violation of this Agreement, Section 2.7(a) of
the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and correct list of (i)
all uncompleted contracts, arrangements, agreements or understandings with
vendors or otherwise for the purchase of equipment or services involving the
payment of $3 million or more in any 12 month period or $8 million in the
aggregate; and (ii) all contracts, arrangements, agreements or understandings
to purchase or acquire any rights under any FCC License or other service
licenses or permits; and (iii) all contracts, arrangements, agreements or
understandings to purchase, acquire, dispose or transfer any tower
or wireless system or part thereof or cell site or any other local service
or access system (including any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary
holding any such interest) or material business enterprise or operation. The
TeleCorp SEC Agreements, together with the agreements required to be
disclosed in Section 2.7(a) of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule are referred
to herein as the "TeleCorp Material Contracts". TeleCorp has previously made
available to AWS true and complete copies of each of the foregoing
agreements.   (b) Neither TeleCorp nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached
or violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which
with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default
under any of the provisions of, or received in writing any claim or threat
that it has breached or is in default under, any of the terms or conditions
of any TeleCorp Material Contract in such a manner as would permit any other
party to cancel or terminate the same or would permit any other party to
collect material damages from TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries under any
TeleCorp Material Contract. Each TeleCorp Material Contract (i) is in full
force and effect, (ii) is a valid and binding obligation of TeleCorp or such
Subsidiary, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors generally or by general
equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or law) and, to the knowledge of TeleCorp, of each
other party thereto, and (iii) is enforceable against TeleCorp or such
Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, and, to the knowledge of TeleCorp,
enforceable against each other party thereto, and such TeleCorp Material
Contracts will continue to be valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms and in full force and effect immediately
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby with no
alteration or acceleration or increase in fees or liabilities.
Neither TeleCorp nor any of its Subsidiaries is or is alleged to be and, to
the knowledge of TeleCorp, no other party is or is alleged to be in default
under, or in breach or violation of, any TeleCorp Material Contract, and no
event has occurred which (whether with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) would constitute such a default, breach or violation. No party to a
TeleCorp Material Contract has terminated or notified TeleCorp in writing of
an intent to materially reduce or terminate the amount of business with
TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries in the future, except as would not individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a TeleCorp Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) There is no agreement, contract or understanding
binding upon TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties which has had or could reasonably be expected to have the effect
of prohibiting or impairing any business or operations of AWS or any of its
Affiliates (other than TeleCorp or its Subsidiaries) or any business practice
of AWS or any of its Affiliates (other than TeleCorp or its Subsidiaries) as
currently conducted. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
exclusivity terms of each of the General Agreement for Purchase of Personal
Communications Systems and Services, dated as of May 1, 1998, among Lucent
Technologies Inc. and TeleCorp PCS, Inc., and the Acquisition Agreement,
dated as of December 30, 1998 among Ericsson Inc., Tritel Finance, Inc. and
Tritel Communications, Inc. do not apply to or limit or bind TeleCorp or its
Subsidiaries beyond December 30, 2005 and May 1, 2003, respectively, and
shall not be or purport to be applicable to, be enforceable against, limit or
bind AWS or any of Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation) at any
time.   (d) Section 2.7(d) of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule contains
a true and accurate list of (i) all contracts, arrangements, agreements
or understandings that are of the type that are required to be disclosed
or described pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, other than those that
are filed as an exhibit to a TeleCorp SEC Report filed prior to the date
hereof, and (ii) all agreements or understandings, whether written or oral,
giving any Person the right to require TeleCorp to register shares of capital
stock or to participate in any such registration.   2.8 Compliance. Each of
TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all respects with, and is
not in default or violation of, (i) its Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws or other equivalent organizational documents, or (ii) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, permit, franchise or other instruments or
obligations to which any of them are a party or by which any of them or any
of their respective assets or properties are bound or affected, except, in
the case of clause (ii), any such failures of compliance, defaults and
violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect.   2.9 SEC Filings;
Financial Statements.   (a) TeleCorp has timely and accurately filed all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to be filed by
it with the SEC since October 13, 1999 (the "TeleCorp SEC Reports") pursuant
to the federal securities Laws and the SEC regulations promulgated
thereunder. Each of TeleCorp\'s Subsidiaries that are obligated to file with
the SEC has timely and accurately filed all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since
October 13, 1999 (the "TeleCorp Subsidiary SEC Reports") pursuant to the
federal securities laws and the SEC regulations promulgated thereunder. The
TeleCorp SEC Reports and TeleCorp Subsidiary SEC Reports were (i) prepared in
accordance, and complied as of their respective filing dates in all material
respects, with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date hereof, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (b) Each of the
audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related notes and schedules thereto) contained in the TeleCorp SEC
Reports (i) complied in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, to the extent otherwise
permitted by Form 10-Q) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be expressly described in the notes thereto)
and (iii) fairly and accurately present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, subject in the case of interim
financial statements to normal year-end adjustments.   2.10 Licenses and
Authorizations.   (a) TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries hold all licenses,
permits, certificates, franchises, ordinances, registrations, or other
rights, applications and authorizations granted or issued by any Governmental
Authority, including, without limitation, the FCC or any state authority
asserting jurisdiction over TeleCorp, its Subsidiaries and their respective
properties and assets, that are required for the conduct of their businesses
as currently being conducted (each, as amended to date, the "TeleCorp
Authorizations"), other than such licenses, permits, certificates,
franchises, ordinances, registrations, or other rights, applications and
authorizations the absence of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of TeleCorp to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. TeleCorp has made available to AWS a
true, complete and correct list of the TeleCorp Authorizations issued by the
FCC.   (b) TeleCorp has previously made available to AWS a true,
complete and correct list of (i) each application of TeleCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries pending before the FCC (the "TeleCorp FCC Applications"); and
(ii) each FCC permit and FCC license which is not a TeleCorp Authorization
but in which TeleCorp, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, holds an interest, including as a stakeholder in the
licensee (collectively, the "Indirect TeleCorp Authorizations"). The
TeleCorp Authorizations, the TeleCorp FCC Applications, and the Indirect
TeleCorp Authorizations are the only licenses, permits, certificates,
franchises, ordinances, registrations, or other rights, applications and
authorizations that are required for the conduct of the business and
operations of TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, other
than such licenses, permits, certificates, franchises, ordinances,
registrations, or other rights, applications and authorizations the absence
of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be considered
reasonably likely to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect or prevent or
materially delay or impair the ability of TeleCorp to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) Except as disclosed in Section
2.10(c) of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule:   (i) The TeleCorp
Authorizations and the Indirect TeleCorp  Authorizations are in full force
and effect and have not been pledged or  otherwise encumbered (except for
such pledges and encumbrances securing  the TeleCorp Licensee\'s indebtedness
to the FCC and/or the United States  Department of Treasury ("USDT"), as the
case may be), assigned, suspended  or modified in any material respect
(except as a result of FCC rule  changes applicable to the industry
generally), canceled or revoked, and  TeleCorp and each of its Subsidiaries
have each operated in compliance  with all terms thereof or any renewals
thereof applicable to them, other  than where the failure to so comply would
not, individually or in the  aggregate, be considered reasonably likely to
have a TeleCorp Material  Adverse Effect.   (ii) To the knowledge of
TeleCorp, no event has occurred with  respect to any of the TeleCorp
Authorizations which permits, or after  notice or lapse of time or both would
permit, revocation or termination  thereof or would result in any other
material impairment of the rights of  the holder of any such TeleCorp
Authorizations.   (iii) To the knowledge of TeleCorp, there is not pending
any  application, petition, objection or other pleading with the FCC, any
state  authority or any similar entity having jurisdiction or authority over
the  operations of TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries which questions the 
validity or contests any TeleCorp Authorization or which could reasonably  be
expected, if accepted or granted, to result in the revocation,  cancellation,
suspension or any material adverse modification of any  TeleCorp
Authorization.   (d) Except as disclosed in Section 2.10(c) of the
TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule:   (i) Each wholly-owned Subsidiary of
TeleCorp set forth in Section  2.10(d) of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule
hereto (a "TeleCorp Licensee")  holds the FCC licenses (each an "FCC License"
and collectively, the "FCC  Licenses") set forth below its name on such same
schedule. Such TeleCorp  Licensee has good and marketable title, free and
clear of any Liens, to  such FCC Licenses, except for such liens securing the
TeleCorp Licensee\'s  indebtedness to the FCC and/or USDT, as the case may
be, not in excess of  $140 million in the aggregate.   (ii) No person or
entity other than the applicable TeleCorp  Licensee and the FCC has any
right, claim or interest in or to any of the  FCC Licenses.   (iii) The FCC
Licenses have been validly issued in the name of  such TeleCorp Licensee, are
in full force and effect, have been granted by  Final Order and TeleCorp has
no reason to believe that such licenses will  not remain in full force and
effect until the respective expiration dates  set forth on the FCC
Licenses.   (iv) Except for proceedings affecting the PCS or wireless 
communications services industry generally, there is not pending, nor to  the
knowledge of TeleCorp, threatened against TeleCorp or any TeleCorp  Licensee
or against any of the TeleCorp Licenses, nor is TeleCorp aware of  any basis
for, any application, action, petition, objection or other  pleading, or any
proceeding with the FCC or any other Governmental  Authority which questions
or contests the validity of, or seeks the  revocation, forfeiture, non-
renewal or suspension of, any of the FCC  Licenses, which seeks the
imposition of any modification or amendment with  respect thereto, or which
would adversely affect the ability of AWS to  employ any of the FCC Licenses
(other than those licenses set forth in  Section 2.25(b) of the TeleCorp
Disclosure Schedule) in its business after  the Closing Date or seeks the
payment of a fine, sanction, penalty,  damages or contribution in connection
with the use of any of the FCC  Licenses.   (v) Each of the FCC Licenses is
unimpaired by any acts or  omissions of TeleCorp or any TeleCorp
Licensee.   (vi) All material documents required to be filed or fees to be 
paid at any time by TeleCorp or the applicable TeleCorp Licensee with the 
FCC with respect to any of the FCC Licenses have been filed or payments  made
or the time period for such filing or payment has not lapsed. All  such
documents filed since the date that each of the FCC Licenses was  issued or
transferred to the applicable TeleCorp Licensee are true and  correct in all
material respects.   (vii) None of the FCC Licenses is subject to any
conditions other  than those generally applicable to the industry at large,
those imposed by  FCC Law generally upon a specific class of FCC licenses or
licensees, and  those appearing on the face of the applicable FCC
License.   (viii) TeleCorp and each TeleCorp Licensee complies in all 
material respects with all pertinent aspects of FCC Law, including without 
limitation (1) the rules, regulations and policies pertaining to  eligibility
to hold broadband PCS licenses in general, and the applicable  FCC Licenses
in particular, including where applicable, Section 24.709 of  the FCC\'s
rules, (2) the rules, regulations and policies governing the  CMRS spectrum
cap and restricting foreign ownership of radio licenses, (3)  the Regulations
and policies relating to wireless E911 (as set forth in  Section 20.18 of the
FCC\'s CMRS rules), and (4) the rules, regulations and  policies relating to
implementation of Communications Assistance for Law  Enforcement Act.  
(ix) TeleCorp and each TeleCorp Licensee is in compliance with  all terms and
conditions of, and all of its obligations under, the  applicable FCC
Licenses. Without limiting the foregoing, TeleCorp or the  applicable
TeleCorp Licensee, where applicable, has made all installment  payments due
in connection with the applicable FCC Licenses to the FCC  and/or the USDT,
as the case may be, on a timely basis and has not been  assessed any unpaid
late payment fees or any unpaid additional interest  charges for failing to
make installment payments to the FCC or USDT.   (x) No person or entity
other than TeleCorp or the applicable  TeleCorp Licensee is authorized to use
the spectrum described in Section  2.10(d) of the TeleCorp Disclosure
Schedule.   (e) Except for the approvals contemplated by Section 2.6, no
permit, consent, approval, authorization, qualification or registration of,
or declaration to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required to
be made or obtained by TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the transfer or deemed transfer of the FCC Licenses and Authorizations as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
such transactions will not result in a breach of such approvals, except where
the failure to obtain or make such permit, consent, approval,
authorization, qualification, registration, declaration or filing would not
be considered reasonably likely to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of TeleCorp to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.   2.11 No Violation of Law. Except as
disclosed in Section 2.11 of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule, the business
of TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries is not currently conducted nor has such
business ever been conducted in violation of any Laws, except for possible
violations none of which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a
TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in TeleCorp SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and, with respect to the FCC, as
disclosed in Section 2.11 of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule, no
investigation, review or proceeding by any Governmental Authority (including,
without limitation, any stock exchange or other self-regulatory body) with
respect to TeleCorp or its Subsidiaries in relation to any alleged violation
of law or regulation is pending or, to TeleCorp\'s knowledge, threatened, nor
has any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation, any stock
exchange or other self-regulatory body) indicated an intention to conduct the
same, except for such investigations which, if they resulted in adverse
findings, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the
TeleCorp SEC Reports, neither TeleCorp nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to any cease and desist or other order, judgment, injunction or decree issued
by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum
of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has adopted
any board resolutions at the request of, any Governmental Authority that
materially restricts the conduct of its business or which would reasonably be
expected to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect, nor has TeleCorp or
any of its Subsidiaries been advised that any Governmental Authority is
considering issuing or requesting any of the foregoing.   2.12 Absence of
Certain Changes or Events.   (a) Since December 31, 2000, except as

businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (the "Ordinary Course of Business") and, (ii) there has not been any

obligations of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, fixed, contingent or
otherwise) other than (i) liabilities or obligations (1) which are accrued or

the date of this Agreement, there is no Litigation pending or, to the
knowledge of TeleCorp, threatened against TeleCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of TeleCorp or any of
its Subsidiaries, before or subject to any Court or Governmental Authority

Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has TeleCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries undertaken or committed to make any such amendments or to adopt

its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of TeleCorp, any other person,
including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could
subject TeleCorp, any of its ERISA Affiliates or any person that TeleCorp or

(including, without limitation, all applicable requirements for notification,
reporting and disclosure to participants or the Department of Labor, the IRS

cause the loss of such qualification or exemption; (v) all contributions
(including premiums for any insurance policy under which benefits for any
TeleCorp Employee Plan are provided) required to be made to any TeleCorp
Employee Plan pursuant to Section 412 of the Code, or any contract, or the

respects in conformance with the applicable statutes or governmental
regulations and rulings relating to such plans in the jurisdictions in which
such TeleCorp Employee Plan is present or operates and, to the extent

Affiliate to provide health care coverage, medical, surgical,
hospitalization, death, life insurance or similar benefits (whether or not
insured) to any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant
of TeleCorp, any of its Subsidiaries or any TeleCorp ERISA Affiliate or to

its Subsidiaries or any TeleCorp ERISA Affiliate, other than COBRA

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of TeleCorp or any of
its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of TeleCorp or any
of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any TeleCorp Employee Plan or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash,
property, or in the form of benefits) by TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code.   (g) The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute a "prohibited transaction"
under ERISA or the Code for which an exemption is unavailable.   (h)
TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries have not made any payments, are not obligated
to make any payments, and are not a party to any agreements that under any
circumstances could obligate any of them to make any payments that would
constitute compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in

the emission, discharge, or release into the environment, of any Hazardous
Material (as defined below); and (iv) TeleCorp and each of its Subsidiaries
has taken all actions necessary under applicable requirements of federal,
state or local laws, rules or regulations to register any products
or materials required to be registered by TeleCorp or its Subsidiaries (or,
to the knowledge of TeleCorp, any of their respective agents) thereunder.
There is no civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, demand, claim,
hearing, notice of violation, investigation, proceeding, notice or demand
letter pending or, to the knowledge of TeleCorp, threatened against TeleCorp
or any of its Subsidiaries relating in any way to the Environmental Laws or
any Regulation, code, plan, Order, decree, judgment, notice or demand letter
issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder, except as would not
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a TeleCorp
Material Adverse Effect.   2.22 Intellectual Property.   (a) TeleCorp and
its Subsidiaries own, or are licensed or otherwise possess legally
enforceable rights to use, all patents, trademarks, trade names, service
marks, copyrights and mask works, any applications for and registrations of
such patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights and
mask works, and all processes, formulae, methods, schematics, technology,
know-how, computer software programs or applications and tangible or
intangible proprietary information or material that are in use or necessary
to conduct the business of TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted, the absence of which would be considered reasonably likely to have
a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect (the "TeleCorp Intellectual Property
Rights").   (b) Neither TeleCorp nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or will as
a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance
of TeleCorp\'s obligations under this Agreement or otherwise be, in breach of
or otherwise cause the termination of or limit any license, sublicense or
other agreement relating to the TeleCorp Intellectual Property Rights, or any
material licenses, sublicenses and other agreements as to which TeleCorp or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which TeleCorp or any of
its Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third party patents, trademarks
or copyrights, including software which is used by TeleCorp or any of
its Subsidiaries, the breach of which would be considered reasonably likely
to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse Effect.   (c) All patents, trademarks,
service marks (or any applications or registrations therefor) and copyrights
which are held by TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries, and which are material
to the business of TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries, are current, in effect,
valid and subsisting. TeleCorp (i) has not been sued in any suit, action or
proceeding or received any demands or claims that are still pending which
involves a claim of infringement of any patents, trademarks, service marks,
copyrights or violation of any trade secret or other proprietary right of any
third party; and (ii) has no knowledge that the marketing, licensing or sale
of its services infringes any patent, trademark, service mark, copyright,
trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party, which
infringement would reasonably be expected to have a TeleCorp Material Adverse
Effect.   (d) Section 2.22(d) of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true and accurate list of all of the agreements, contracts and licenses
that are related to, affect, or give rise to any rights or obligation of
TeleCorp or any of its subsidiaries with respect to, the "SunCom" trademark,
and related trade names, service names, copyrights and marks, including,
without limitation, as relate to Affiliate License Co., LLC or any other
entity through which TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries holds any such
rights.   2.23 No Restrictions on the Merger; Takeover Statutes. The Board
of Directors of TeleCorp has taken the necessary action to render Section 203
of the DGCL, and any other potentially applicable anti-takeover or similar
statute or regulation or provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws, or other organizational or constitutive document or governing
instruments of TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries or any TeleCorp Material
Agreement to which any of them is a party, inapplicable to this Agreement and
the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.   2.24 Tax Matters. Neither TeleCorp nor any of its Affiliates
has taken or agreed to take any action, failed to take any action or is aware
of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
or the combination of the Merger and Follow-On Merger, as applicable, from
qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.  
2.25 Build-out Requirements. Other than as set forth in Section 2.10(c) of
the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule, where the five-year deadline
for satisfaction of the minimum build-out requirement under 47 C.F.R. 24.203
has passed, TeleCorp has satisfied the build-out requirement and has so
notified the FCC in a timely manner. Furthermore, other than for those
licenses set forth in Section 2.25(b) of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule,
TeleCorp has filed notifications of satisfaction of minimum build-out
requirements for all C- and F- Block designated entity licenses that are not
otherwise freely transferable to AWS. TeleCorp has not received from the FCC
any notice indicating that any FCC License with respect to which TeleCorp has
submitted to the FCC a minimum build-out certification failed or fails to
satisfy the minimum build-out requirement in respect of such FCC License.
Other than as set forth in Section 2.10(c) of the TeleCorp Disclosure
Schedule, TeleCorp is not in breach or otherwise in violation of any FCC
build-out requirement relating to any FCC License. On or prior to the date
hereof, TeleCorp has entered into the agreement (the "Transfer Agreement"),
attached hereto as Exhibit F, to transfer control of, assign, or otherwise
convey an interest in, on or prior to Closing, the FCC Licenses set forth in
Section 2.25(b) of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule.   2.26 Brokers. Except
for JP Morgan Chase and Co. and Lehman Bros. Inc., no broker, financial
advisor, finder or investment banker or other Person is entitled to any
broker\'s, financial advisor\'s, finder\'s or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of TeleCorp. TeleCorp has heretofore
furnished to AWS a true, complete and correct copy of all agreements between
TeleCorp and JP Morgan Chase and Co. and Lehman Bros. Inc. pursuant to which
such firms would be entitled to any payment relating to the
transactions contemplated hereunder. The total fees and expenses of JP Morgan
Chase and Co. and Lehman Bros. Inc. relating to the transactions contemplated
hereunder, shall not exceed the amount set forth in Section 2.26 of the
TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule.   2.27 Opinion of Financial Advisor. TeleCorp
has received the written opinions of its financial advisors, Lehman Bros.
Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., to the effect that, in their opinion,
(i) the Exchange Ratio applicable to each class of TeleCorp Common Stock

financial point of view, to the holders (other than AWS) of such class of
stock and (ii) the Exchange Ratio applicable to each of the TeleCorp Series C
Preferred Stock and TeleCorp Series E Preferred Stock is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders (other than AWS) of such stock.   
ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AWS   Except as set forth
in the AWS Disclosure Schedule previously delivered to TeleCorp concurrently
herewith (the "AWS Disclosure Schedule"), AWS, on behalf of itself and Merger
Sub, represents and warrants to TeleCorp that the statements contained in
this Article III are true, complete and correct. The AWS Disclosure Schedule
shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered
paragraphs contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any paragraph
shall qualify only the corresponding paragraph of this Article III. As used
in this Agreement, an "AWS Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event,
occurrence, effect or state of facts (a) that is materially adverse to or
materially impairs (i) the business, assets (including intangible assets),
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of AWS and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of AWS to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, (b) prevents consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that none of the
following shall be considered a Material Adverse Effect except to the
extent AWS is affected in a materially disproportionate manner as compared to
other wireless telecommunications service providers: (x) changes in general
economic conditions in the United States, (y) conditions affecting the
wireless telecommunications services industry generally and (z) any changes
resulting from announcement of the Merger.   3.1 Organization and
Qualification; Subsidiaries.   (a) AWS is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has all the requisite corporate power and authority necessary to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. AWS is duly qualified or licensed
as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an AWS
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Each Subsidiary of AWS is a legal entity,
duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and
has all the requisite power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
Each Subsidiary of AWS is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an AWS Material Adverse Effect. Merger Sub has
not engaged in any activities other than in connection with the fulfillment
of its or AWS\'s obligations under this Agreement.   3.2 Certificate of
Incorporation; By-laws. AWS has heretofore made available to TeleCorp a true,
complete and correct copy of its and Merger Sub\'s respective Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws (or other equivalent organizational or constitutive
documents), each as amended or restated to date. Each such Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of AWS and Merger Sub are in full force and effect.
Neither AWS nor Merger Sub is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or other equivalent organizational
documents.   3.3 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital of AWS
consists of: 10,000,000,000 shares of AWS Common Stock and 1,000,000,000

shares of AWS Common Stock and outstanding warrants (all of which warrants
had an exercise price on such date of $35.00 per share of AWS Common Stock)
to acquire 41,784,273 shares of AWS Common Stock. Except as set forth above,
there are no other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights,
or agreements that obligate AWS to issue or sell any shares of AWS Common
Stock. None of the outstanding shares of AWS Common Stock are subject to, nor
were they issued in violation of, any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar
right.   (c) All outstanding shares of AWS Common Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued (including pursuant to the Securities Act), fully
paid and non-assessable and not subject to any kind of preemptive (or
similar) rights.   (d) As of October 7, 2001, AWS and its Subsidiaries own:

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement Amendment and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery by AWS of this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement Amendment, the performance of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation by AWS of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by all
corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of AWS are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement Amendment
or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. Each of this Agreement and
the Stockholders Agreement Amendment has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by AWS and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
thereof by all other parties to such agreements, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of AWS in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating
to or affecting creditors generally or by general equitable principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or law).   3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   (a)
The execution and delivery by each of AWS and Merger Sub of this Agreement
and the Stockholders Agreement Amendment do not, and the performance of this
Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement Amendment will not, (i) conflict
with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or
other equivalent organizational or constitutive documents of AWS or Merger
Sub, (ii) conflict with or violate any Law, Regulation or Order in each case
applicable to AWS or Merger Sub or by which any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach or violation
of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or impair AWS\'s or Merger Sub\'s rights
or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to
others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of AWS
or Merger Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which AWS or Merger Sub is a party or by which AWS or Merger
Sub or its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except
in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) above, for any such conflicts, breaches,
violations, defaults or other occurrences that would not individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an AWS Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The execution and delivery by AWS of
this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement Amendment do not, and the
performance of this Agreement and the and Stockholders Agreement Amendment
will not, require AWS to obtain any approval of any Person or approval of,
observe any waiting period imposed by, or make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority domestic or foreign, except for
(i) compliance with applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Securities Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws, the HSR Act, or any Foreign
Competition Laws, the Communications Act, and the regulations of the FCC,
state public utility, telecommunications or public service laws, (ii)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL and/or
(iii) where the failure to obtain such approvals, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have an AWS Material Adverse Effect. The approval or
authorization required to be obtained from the FCC pursuant to the
Communications Act and/or the rules and regulations of the FCC, are referred
to herein as the "Required AWS Governmental Approvals" and, together with the
Required TeleCorp Governmental Approvals, as the "Required Governmental
Approvals").   3.6 Compliance. Except as disclosed in the AWS SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, each of AWS and Merger Sub is in
compliance in all material respects with, and is not in default or violation
of, (i) its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws or other equivalent
organizational or constitutive documents or (ii) any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, permit, franchise or other instruments or
obligations to which any of them are a party or by which any of them or any
of their respective assets or properties are bound or affected, except, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such failures of compliance,
defaults and violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an AWS Material Adverse Effect.   3.7 SEC
Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) AWS has timely filed all forms,
reports, schedules, statements and documents required to be filed with the
SEC since July 9, 2001 (such filings, together with Amendment No. 4 to
Registration Statement on Form S-1 dated July 6, 2001, collectively, the "AWS
SEC Reports") pursuant to the Federal securities Laws and the SEC regulations
promulgated thereunder. The AWS SEC Reports were prepared in accordance, and
complied as of their respective filing dates in all material respects, with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and did not at the time they were filed
(or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, then on
the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.   (b) Each of the audited and
unaudited consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes and schedules thereto) contained in the AWS SEC Reports (i)
complied in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, to the
extent otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q) applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be expressly described in the
notes thereto) and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of AWS and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, subject in the case of interim
financial statements to normal year-end adjustments.   3.8 Licenses and
Authorizations. Except as disclosed in the AWS SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, AWS and its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, permits,
certificates, franchises, ordinances, registrations, or other rights,
applications and authorizations required to be filed with or granted or
issued by any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the FCC
or any state authority asserting over AWS and its Subsidiaries, and their
respective properties and assets, that are required for the conduct of their
businesses as currently being conducted (each, as amended to date, the "AWS
Authorizations"), other than such licenses, permits,
certificates, franchises, ordinances, registrations, or other rights,
applications and authorizations the absence of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have an AWS Material Adverse
Effect.   3.9 No Violation of Law. Except as set forth in the AWS SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, neither AWS nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease and desist, or other, order,
judgment, injunction or decree issued by, or is a party to any written
agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a
party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to
any order or directive by, or has adopted any board resolutions at the
request of, any Governmental Authority that materially restricts the conduct
of its business or which would reasonably be expected to have an AWS Material
Adverse Effect, nor has AWS or any of its Subsidiaries been advised that any
Governmental Authority is considering issuing or requesting any of the
foregoing.   3.10 Absence of Litigation. Except as disclosed in the AWS
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no
Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of AWS, threatened against AWS or
Merger Sub, or any properties or rights of AWS or Merger Sub, before or
subject to any Court or Governmental Authority which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, an AWS Material
Adverse Effect.   3.11 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
None of the information supplied by AWS in writing for inclusion in the
Registration Statement shall, at the time such document is filed, at the time
amended or supplemented, at the time the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC and at date of the TeleCorp Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the information supplied by AWS for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement in connection with the TeleCorp Stockholders\' Meeting will,
on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of
TeleCorp and at the date of the TeleCorp Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any event relating to AWS or any of
its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by AWS which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, AWS shall
promptly inform TeleCorp. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AWS makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by
TeleCorp which is contained in the Registration Statement or Proxy
Statement.   3.12 Taxes.   (a) All Federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns required to be filed (taking into account extensions) on or before
the Effective Time by or on behalf of AWS, Merger Sub, and each affiliated,
combined, consolidated or unitary group for Tax purposes of which AWS or
Merger Sub is or has been a member have been or will be timely filed, and all
such Tax Returns are or will be true, complete and correct, except to the
extent that any failure to file or any inaccuracies in filed Tax Returns
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have
an AWS Material Adverse Effect.   (b) All Taxes due and payable on or before
the Effective Time by or with respect to AWS and Merger Sub have been or will
be timely paid, or, in the case of Taxes due (taking into account extensions)
prior to June 30, 2001, are adequately reserved for including for claims yet
unasserted for items that have been assessed in the past (other than a
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax treatment) in accordance with GAAP on AWS\'s balance sheet filed
with Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2001 and will be adequately
reserved for (other than a reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax treatment) in accordance with GAAP on
AWS\'s balance sheet as of the date of the Effective Time, except to the
extent that any failure to pay or reserve for such Taxes would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an AWS
Material Adverse Effect.   (c) There are no audits, disputes pending or
administrative proceedings, or claims asserted in writing, for Taxes or
assessments for which AWS or Merger Sub is responsible, nor has AWS or Merger
Sub been requested to give or has been granted any currently effective
waivers extending the statutory period of limitation applicable to any
Federal, state, local or foreign income Tax return for which AWS is
responsible for any period which audits, disputes, administrative
proceedings, claims, assessments or waivers would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have an AWS Material Adverse Effect. All
assessments for Taxes due and owing by or with respect to AWS and Merger Sub
with respect to completed and settled examinations or concluded litigation
have been paid or accrued.   (d) None of AWS or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to include in a taxable period ending after the Effective
Time an amount of taxable income attributable to income that accrued in a
prior taxable period but was not recognized in any prior taxable period as a
result of the installment method of accounting, the completed contract method
of accounting, the cash method of accounting or Section 481 of the Code or
any other provisions of Federal, state, local or foreign tax law, if any such
inclusion of income would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have an AWS Material Adverse Effect.   (e) AWS has not
distributed the stock of a "controlled corporation" as defined in Section
355(a) of the Code, and other than pursuant to the distribution by AWS\'s
former parent on July 9, 2001 (the "AWS Spin-Off"), AWS stock has not been
distributed in a transaction intended to qualify under section 355 of the
Code. The Merger is not part of a plan or series of related transactions
together with the Spin-Off pursuant to which one or more persons acquire
directly or indirectly AWS stock representing a 50% or greater interest in
AWS.   3.13 Tax Matters. AWS nor any of its Affiliates has taken or
agreed to take any action, failed to take any action or is aware of any fact
or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger or the
combination of the Merger and the Follow-On Merger, as applicable, from
qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.  
3.14 Absence of Changes. Since July 9, 2001, except as expressly disclosed in

Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the Ordinary Course
of Business and (ii) there has not been any change, event, development,
damage or circumstance affecting AWS or any of its Subsidiaries which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or could reasonably be expected to
have, an AWS Material Adverse Effect.   3.15 Brokers. Except for Merrill
Lynch and Co., no broker, financial advisor, finder or investment banker or
other Person is entitled to any broker\'s, financial advisor\'s, finder\'s or
other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by

Control Severance Policy in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G, and has
entered into the letter agreement with TeleCorp Management Corp. in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit H.    ARTICLE IV   ADDITIONAL

hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the plants, properties, books
and records of it and its Subsidiaries as AWS may from time to time
reasonably request, (ii) it will furnish or cause to be furnished to AWS and
the AWS Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information as it may from time to time reasonably request and (iii) it will
provide AWS and the AWS Representatives such access to the representatives,

request. TeleCorp shall not be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such access of disclosure would contravene any applicable
Law. AWS agrees that it will, and will cause the AWS Representatives to,
continue to treat all information obtained hereunder as "Evaluation Material"
under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 2, 2001 ("Confidentiality
Agreement").   4.2 Conduct of Business Pending the Closing Date.   (a)

(including that of its  Subsidiaries) to be conducted only in the Ordinary
Course of Business  consistent with reasonably anticipated subscriber growth
and in compliance  with applicable Laws and (y) use all reasonable efforts to
preserve intact  TeleCorp\'s business organization, keep available the
services of its  employees and preserve the current relationships with its
customers,  suppliers and other persons with which it has significant
business  relations; and   (ii) without limiting the foregoing, it shall
not, and shall not  permit any of its Subsidiaries to:   (A) amend its
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or other  equivalent organizational
document;   (B) (1) merge, consolidate or engage in a similar business 
combination or (2) make any disposition of any direct or indirect  ownership
interest in or assets comprising any tower or wireless  system or part

Business),  except sales of individual assets (other than inventory) in the

that is consistent as to timing and amount with  the timing and amount of

2001 and in any case does not result  in there being outstanding options to
purchase more than 13,278,252  shares of TeleCorp Class A Voting Stock
(assuming, for purposes of  this clause (A), that no outstanding options are
exercised), and  provided that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  hereby shall not constitute a change of control with respect to
any  of such options (except that any such options held by participants  in
Titan\'s Change of Control Severance Policy shall be subject to  such
accelerated vesting provisions as may be provided in such  plan), and
provided, further that the exercise price of such options  shall be no less
than the fair market value of such shares on the  date of grant, and (B) the
issuance of TeleCorp Class A Voting  Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the Outstanding TeleCorp  Options and any options granted in accordance with
clause (A);   (D) split, combine or reclassify any outstanding shares of

redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, purchase  or

Recommendations.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, TeleCorp and AWS will cooperate in preparing and will file
with the SEC the Registration Statement, which shall include the Proxy
Statement. Each of TeleCorp and AWS will respond jointly and promptly to any
comments of the SEC, will use all reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and TeleCorp will cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the

practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of TeleCorp and AWS will
prepare and file any other documents required to be filed by it under the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other Federal, state, foreign or Blue
Sky or related laws relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Other Filings"). No amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by TeleCorp or
AWS, without the prior approval of the other party except as required by Law,
and then only to the extent necessary. Each of TeleCorp and AWS will notify
the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff
or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing or for

one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement,
the Merger or any Other Filing. Each of TeleCorp and AWS will cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under this Section 4.3(a) to comply in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an

the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of
TeleCorp, such amendment or supplement.   (b) The Directors\'
Recommendations shall be included in the Proxy Statement, except that the
TeleCorp Board may, to the extent required, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to AWS such recommendation only if the TeleCorp Board of Directors
determines, in good faith, after consultation with, outside legal counsel,
that such action is required in order for the TeleCorp directors to comply
with their fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable law.   4.4
Meeting of TeleCorp Stockholders. TeleCorp shall promptly after the date
hereof take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and
its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws to duly call, give notice of and
hold the TeleCorp Stockholders\' Meeting as soon as practicable following the
date hereof in order to permit the consummation of the Merger as promptly
as practicable, for the purpose of obtaining the Required Stockholder
Approval. Once the TeleCorp Stockholders\' Meeting has been called and
noticed, TeleCorp shall not postpone or adjourn (other than for the absence
of a quorum and then only to the next possible future date) the TeleCorp
Stockholders\' Meeting without AWS\'s consent. The Board of Directors of
TeleCorp shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of TeleCorp, whether
or not the Board of Directors of TeleCorp at any time changes, withdraws or
modifies its recommendation. TeleCorp shall solicit from stockholders of
TeleCorp proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required
by the DGCL and its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize this Agreement
and the Merger, subject to Section 4.3(b). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) TeleCorp agrees that its obligation to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the TeleCorp Stockholders\' Meeting as required
by this Section 4.4, shall not be affected by any withdrawal, amendment or
modification of the TeleCorp Board of Directors\' recommendation of the
Merger and this Agreement, and (ii) TeleCorp agrees that its obligations
under this Section 4.4 shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to TeleCorp of any Acquisition
Proposal.   4.5 Non-Solicitation.   (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VI, TeleCorp shall not, nor shall
TeleCorp permit any of their Subsidiaries to, nor shall TeleCorp authorize or
permit any of its officers, directors or employees to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant, or other representatives retained by them or any of
their respective Subsidiaries not to (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) any proposals that constitute,
or could reasonably be expected to result in, a proposal or offer for an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions
concerning, or provide any non-public information regarding TeleCorp or any
of its Subsidiaries to any person or entity relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent TeleCorp or its Board of Directors from, (A) prior to
receipt of the Required Stockholder Approval, furnishing non-public
information to, or entering into discussions with, any person or entity in
connection with an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such
person or entity if and only to the extent that (1) the Company is not then
in breach of its obligations under this Section 4.5(a), (2) the Board of
Directors of TeleCorp believes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and the Board of
Directors of TeleCorp determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that failure to take such action may constitute a
breach of the Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties to its stockholders under
applicable law and (3) prior to furnishing such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person or entity, such
Board of Directors receives from such Person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms no less restrictive than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement or (B) complying with Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal.   (b) Upon receiving an Acquisition Proposal,
TeleCorp will promptly notify AWS (which notice shall be provided orally and
in writing and shall identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal),
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any amendment or change in any
previously received Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to TeleCorp or any Subsidiary of TeleCorp or for access
to the properties, books or records of TeleCorp or any Subsidiary of TeleCorp
by any Person that has made, or to TeleCorp\'s knowledge may be considering
making, an Acquisition Proposal. TeleCorp shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and use best
efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
consultants, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all discussions and
negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to the date hereof with any
Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall request the return
or destruction of all confidential information provided to any such
Person.   (c) TeleCorp (i) agrees not to release any Person from, or waive
any provision of, or fail to enforce, any standstill agreement or similar
agreement to which it is a party related to, or which could affect, an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) acknowledges that the provisions of clause (i)
are an important and integral part of this Agreement.   (d) For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal for, or
any indication of interest in, any (i) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business or asset of TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries that
constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of TeleCorp
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) direct or indirect acquisition
or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity securities, or 15% of the
voting power, of TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of TeleCorp
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or
more of any class of equity securities, or 15% of the voting power, of
TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of TeleCorp and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (iv) merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the net revenue, net income or assets of TeleCorp
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal obtained not in
breach of this Section 4.5 for or in respect of all of the outstanding
TeleCorp Capital Stock, on terms that the Board of Directors of TeleCorp
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial
advisors and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement deemed relevant by such Board of
Directors, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions,
conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation, and the ability
of the party making such proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition
Proposal and taking into account all other legal, financial, regulatory and
all other aspects of such proposal) are more favorable to its stockholders
than the Merger.   4.6 Blue Sky. TeleCorp and AWS will use all their
respective reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time all
necessary state securities or "blue sky" Permits and approvals required to
permit the distribution of the shares of AWS Common Stock to be issued in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.   4.7 Registration and
Listing of AWS Capital Stock.   (a) AWS will use all reasonable efforts to

Agreement, and upon exercise of stock options granted to employees of
TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries, under the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act and, if required, under any applicable state securities
laws.   (b) AWS will use all reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
AWS Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement and upon the
exercise of stock options granted to employees of TeleCorp and its
Subsidiaries, to be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  
4.8 Further Actions.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
TeleCorp and AWS agree to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements including, without
limitation, using all reasonable efforts: (i) to obtain prior to the Closing
Date, and satisfy any conditions precedent to the grant of, all licenses,
certificates, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications
and orders of governmental authorities and any other Person, including
Persons who are parties to contracts with TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries
or AWS or any of its Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, without
limitation, the Required Governmental Approvals and such consents and
approvals as may be required under the Communications Act, the HSR Act and
any similar Federal, state or foreign legislation; (ii) to effect all
necessary registrations and filings; and (iii) to furnish to each other
such information and assistance as reasonably may be requested in connection
with the foregoing. Each of TeleCorp and AWS shall cooperate fully with each
other to the extent reasonably required to obtain such consents. The Parties
agree to respond promptly to requests received from any Governmental
Authority for additional information in connection with the Merger.   (b)
TeleCorp and AWS shall use all reasonable efforts promptly to make all
filings which may be required by each of them in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act
and any similar Federal, state or foreign legislation.   (c) TeleCorp and
AWS shall each use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any competitive
issues relating to or arising under the HSR Act or any other Federal, state
or foreign antitrust or fair trade law raised by any Governmental Authority
and to obtain any approval or authorization required to be obtained from the
FCC pursuant to the Communications Act and/or the rules and regulations of
the FCC, in each case, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Related Agreements. If offers to resolve any issues
are not accepted by such Governmental Authority on FCC, TeleCorp (with AWS\'s
cooperation) shall promptly pursue all litigation resulting from such issues.
The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf or any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
Federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law or the Communications
Act or any FCC Regulations. In the event of a challenge to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or the Communications
Act or any FCC Regulations, the parties hereto shall use their reasonable
best efforts to defeat such challenge, including by institution and defense
of litigation, or to settle such challenge on terms that permit the
consummation of the Merger.   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, (i) except as set forth in Section 4.8(f),
neither TeleCorp nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without AWS\'s prior
written consent, commit to any divestiture or hold separate or similar
transaction, and (ii) each of TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries shall commit to,
and shall use all their reasonable efforts to effect, such transactions or
divestitures (which may, at TeleCorp\'s option, be conditioned upon the
Closing and be effective as of the Effective Time) as AWS shall request;
provided that, with respect to any of TeleCorp\'s FCC Licenses for which
divestiture may be required to ensure compliance with the spectrum cap (47
C.F.R. ss. 20.6), AWS agrees to make any such request to the extent
required pursuant to FCC Regulations to enable receipt of any approvals or
authorizations of the FCC required in connection with or to permit
consummation of the Merger unless such request could lead to an action or
result that AWS would not be required take or accept pursuant to the next
following sentence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing herein shall require AWS to agree to divest or hold
separate any portion of, or restrict or limit the operations of, any of its
business or TeleCorp\'s business or otherwise take action that could
reasonably be expected to (A) impair the ability of (1) AWS, directly or
through its Subsidiaries, to own and operate the respective businesses of AWS
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing, or (2) AWS to own the shares of the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing, or (3) AWS to own and operate its
business if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, in each
case, in substantially the same manner as operated immediately prior to the
date hereof or (B) materially impair the ability of AWS, directly or through
its Subsidiaries, to own and operate the business of TeleCorp and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing or result in a TeleCorp Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) TeleCorp shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate,
on or prior to the Closing, the transactions contemplated by the
Transfer Agreement.   (f) TeleCorp shall or shall cause its appropriate
subsidiaries to divest itself or themselves of the FCC Licenses set forth on
Section 2.25 of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule as and to the extent
required pursuant to FCC Regulations to enable receipt of any approvals or
authorizations of the FCC required in connection with or to permit
consummation of the Merger.   (g) AWS agrees that, at any time prior to the
earlier of (x) termination of this Agreement, (y) receipt of the Required
Stockholder Approval or (z) the withdrawal or modification of the Directors\'
Recommendation in a manner adverse to AWS or the recommendation of the
TeleCorp Board of any transaction that is inconsistent with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, it shall vote any shares of TeleCorp Capital
Stock owned by AWS and entitled to vote thereon (i) in favor of adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) against any
other matters that would be inconsistent with consummation of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.   (h) TeleCorp shall cause that
certain Management Agreement between TeleCorp Management Corp. and TeleCorp
PCS,Inc., dated as of July 17, 1998, as amended May 25,1999, October 18,
1999, and November 13, 2000 ("Management Agreement") to be terminated
effective on the Closing Date, no later than simultaneously with the Closing,
with no further obligation on the part of TeleCorp or any of its
Subsidiaries, provided that, Sections 8(b), 8(c), 8(d) and Section 13 of the
Management Agreement shall survive upon termination of the Management
Agreement, and Section 4(a) of the Management Agreement shall survive with
respect to any reimbursable expenses under Section 4(a) of the
Management Agreement incurred by Management prior to the date of termination
of the Management Agreement.   4.9 Notification. Each party shall promptly
notify the other parties of:   (a) any notice or other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Related Agreements;   (b) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement Amendment; and   (c) any
action suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced or, to its
knowledge, threatened against or otherwise affecting such notifying party,
which relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Related Agreement.   4.10 Notice of Breaches; Updates.  
(a) TeleCorp shall promptly deliver to AWS written notice of any event or
development that would (i) render any statement, representation or warranty
of TeleCorp in this Agreement or the Related Agreements (including
the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule) inaccurate or incomplete in any material
respect or (ii) constitute or result in a breach by TeleCorp of, or a failure
by TeleCorp or any Subsidiary of TeleCorp to comply with, any agreement or
covenant in this Agreement or the Related Agreements. No such disclosure
shall be deemed to avoid or cure any such misrepresentation or breach.  
(b) AWS shall promptly deliver to TeleCorp written notice of any event or
development that would (i) render any statement, representation or warranty
of AWS in this Agreement (including the AWS Disclosure Schedule) or
the Stockholders Agreement Amendment inaccurate or incomplete in any
material respect or (ii) constitute or result in a breach by AWS of, or a
failure by AWS or any Subsidiary to comply with, any agreement or covenant in
this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement Amendment applicable to it. No
such disclosure shall be deemed to avoid or cure any such misrepresentation
or breach.   4.11 Affiliates. TeleCorp (i) has disclosed to AWS in Section
4.11 of the TeleCorp Disclosure Schedule hereof all persons who are, or may
be, as of the date hereof its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act, and (ii) shall use all its reasonable efforts to cause each
person who is identified as its "affiliate" in Section 4.11 of the TeleCorp
Disclosure Schedule to deliver to AWS as promptly as practicable but in no
event later than 10 days prior to the Closing Date, a signed agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. TeleCorp shall notify
AWS from time to time of any other persons who then are, or may be, such an
"affiliate" and use all its reasonable efforts to cause each additional
person who is identified as an "affiliate" to execute a signed agreement as
set forth in this Section 4.11.   4.12 Employee Benefit Matters. Following
the Effective Time for a period of at least one year, AWS shall provide to
officers and employees of TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries who continue
employment employee benefits under employee benefit plans on terms and
conditions which are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided
by TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries to their officers and employees prior to the
Effective Time; provided, that in its discretion AWS may provide to such
officers and employees the employee benefits provided to similarly situated
AWS officers and employees. With respect to any benefits plans of AWS or its
Subsidiaries in which the officers and employees of TeleCorp and its
Subsidiaries participate after the Effective Time, AWS shall: (i) waive any
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
officers and employees under any welfare benefit plan in which such employees
may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time (provided, however,
that no such waiver shall apply to a pre-existing condition of any
such officer or employee who was, as of the Effective Time, excluded
from participation in a TeleCorp benefit plan by nature of such pre-
existing condition), (ii) provide each such officer and employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time during
the year in which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare benefit plan in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
and (iii) recognize all service of such officers and employees with TeleCorp
and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors) as an employee or
officer of AWS to the extent that such service was credited under similar
TeleCorp Employee Plans for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting credit in any benefit plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such treatment
would result in duplicative accrual of benefits for the same period of
service, and with respect to newly adopted AWS plans, to the extent that
similarly situated AWS employees are not provided with recognition of
service. Nothing herein shall be construed as conferring upon any employee
any legal rights with respect to a continuation of employment or other
relationship with AWS or its Subsidiaries.   4.13 Indemnification and
Insurance.   (a) The Surviving Corporation and AWS shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (in
the case of AWS, only to the extent that would be permitted by applicable Law
if the Indemnitee were an officer, director or employee of AWS rather than
TeleCorp or its Subsidiaries at the relevant time), the individuals who on or
prior to the Effective Time were officers, directors and employees of
TeleCorp or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect
to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the
request of TeleCorp or any of its Subsidiaries at any time on or prior to the
Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
honor all indemnification obligations presently provided under TeleCorp\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws in effect on the date hereof. The
Surviving Corporation shall honor all indemnification agreements with
Indemnitees (including under TeleCorp\'s By-Laws) in effect as of the date of
this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. TeleCorp has disclosed
to AWS all such indemnification agreements prior to the date of this
Agreement.   (b) For six years after the Effective Time, AWS shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to procure the provision of officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person currently covered by
TeleCorp\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, that if the aggregate annual
premiums for such insurance at any time during such period shall exceed 250%
of the per annum rate of premium paid by TeleCorp and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof for such insurance, then AWS shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase only such coverage as shall then be
available at an annual premium equal to 250% of such rate.   (c) The
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall, from and
after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to limitation of certain liabilities of directors and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Certificate of
Incorporation of TeleCorp, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals
who at the Effective Time were directors or officers of TeleCorp.   (d) In
the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, or otherwise dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, AWS shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section
4.13.   4.14 Plan of Reorganization. This Agreement is intended
to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).   4.15 Tax-Free Exchange. The parties
intend the Merger or the combination of the Merger and the Follow-On Merger,
as applicable, to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code. Each of the Parties will use all reasonable efforts, and each agrees to
cooperate with the other and provide each other with such documentation,
information and materials, as may be reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable, to cause the Merger or the combination of the Merger and the
Follow-On Merger, as applicable, to so qualify and to obtain, as of the
Effective Time and, to the extent necessary, as of the date the Form S-4
shall become effective, the opinions required pursuant to Section 5.2(b) and
Section 5.3(b) hereof. No party hereto will knowingly take any action, fail
to take any action, or cause any action to be taken if such action or failure
to take such action would cause the Merger or the combination of the Merger
and the Follow-On Merger, as applicable, not to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code. Except as required pursuant to a
determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code), no party hereto
will take any Tax reporting position (whether on a Tax Return or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger, or the combination of
the Merger and the Follow-On Merger, as the case may be, as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   4.16 Extension of

each of the Birmingham, AL BTA and the Tuscasloosa, AL BTA, shall be
exercisable through the fifth day following such termination.    ARTICLE

the effect that that for federal income tax purposes the Merger or the
combination of the Merger and the Follow-On Merger, as applicable, will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(including any adjournment or postponement thereof).   6.2 Obligations in
Event of Termination. In the event of any termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 6.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void

termination by AWS under clause (iii), if within 12 months after
the termination of this Agreement TeleCorp enters into an agreement with
respect of an Acquisition Proposal with any Person (other than AWS or its
Subsidiaries) or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (it being understood
that in the event the Board of Directors of TeleCorp recommends the
acceptance by the TeleCorp stockholders of a tender offer or exchange offer
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, such recommendation shall be treated
as though an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal had been
entered into on such date), TeleCorp shall pay to AWS, not later than the
date such agreement is entered into, an amount equal to the Termination Fee.
For purposes of this Section 6.3, a proposal or offer will be deemed to have
been publicly disclosed, without limitation, if it becomes known to holders

for the right to receive the Series E Redemption Price therefor in

specifically prohibit such declaration, payment or setting apart for  payment
or such redemption, purchase or other acquisition, or provide that  such

Katz 51 West 52nd Street New York, New York 10019-6150  Cadwalader,
Wickersham and Taft 100 Maiden Lane New York, New York 10038  Re: The Merger
of [Merger Sub] with and into [Titan] 
------------------------------------------------  Ladies and Gentlemen:  
In connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") dated as of [__], 2001, by and among
[Apple], a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), [Merger Sub], a
Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and [Titan], a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the undersigned
certifies and represents on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub and as to Parent
and Merger Sub, after due inquiry and investigation, as follows (any
capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given to
such term in the Merger Agreement):   1. The facts relating to the
contemplated merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as described in the Merger Agreement and
the documents described in the Merger Agreement are, insofar as such facts
pertain to Parent and Merger Sub, true, correct and complete in all material
respects. The Merger will be consummated strictly in accordance with the
Merger Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions therein
related to the Merger has been or will be waived or modified. The facts that
relate to the Merger and related transactions, as described in the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed in connection with the Merger and
the proxy statement-prospectus (the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus") contained
therein, each as amended or supplemented through the date hereof, are true,
correct, and complete in all material respects and will be true, correct, and
complete in all material respects at the Effective Time. The Merger is
being effected for bona fide business reasons.   2. The fair market value
of the voting common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent
Common Stock"), the Series C Preferred Stock of Parent (the "Parent Series C
Preferred Stock") to be designated as having terms substantially as set forth
in the form of the Series C Preferred Certificate of Designation attached as
Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement, and the Preferred Stock of Parent to be
designated as Series E Preferred Stock of Parent, having terms substantially
as set forth in the form of the Series E Preferred Certificate of Designation
attached as Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement (together with the Parent
Series C Preferred Stock, the "Parent Preferred Stock"; the Parent Common
Stock and the Parent Preferred Stock, the "Parent Stock"), and cash in lieu
of a fractional share of Parent Stock to be received by each shareholder of
the Company in the Merger will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of the Class A Voting Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Class A Common Stock"), the Class C Common Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Class C Common Stock"),
the Class D Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Class D Common Stock"), the Class E Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Class E Common Stock"), the
Class F Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Class F Common Stock"), and the Voting Preference Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Voting Preference Common
Stock", and together with the Company Class A Common Stock, the Company Class
C Common Stock, the Company Class D Common Stock, the Company Class E Common
Stock, and the Company Class F Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock), and
the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Series A Preferred Stock"), the Series B Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Series B
Preferred Stock"), the Series C Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Company (the "Company Series C Preferred Stock"), the Series D
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Series E Preferred Stock"), the Series F
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Series F Preferred Stock"), and the Series G Preferred Stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the Company Series G Preferred Stock", together
with the Company Common Stock, the Company Series A Preferred Stock, the
Company Series B Preferred Stock, the Company Series C Preferred Stock, the
Company Series D Preferred Stock, the Company Series E Preferred Stock, and
the Company Series F Preferred Stock, the "Company Stock"), surrendered in
exchange therefore. The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders
of Company Stock was determined by arm\'s length negotiations between the
managements of Parent and the Company.   3. In connection with the Merger,
no holder of Company Stock will receive in exchange for Company Stock,
directly or indirectly, any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub other
than Parent Stock, cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof, and cash paid
to dissenting shareholders of the Company.   4. Following the Merger, the
Company will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets and
at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets held by the Company
and Merger Sub, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Merger. For
purposes of this representation, amounts paid by the Company or Merger Sub to
shareholders who receive cash or other property (including cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Stock), amounts used by the Company and Merger
Sub to pay reorganization expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and
all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made
by the Company immediately preceding, or in contemplation of, the Merger will
be considered assets held by the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
immediately prior to the Merger.   5. At least 50 percent of the value of
the shareholders\' proprietary interests in Company will be preserved as a
proprietary interest in Parent received in exchange for Company Stock.
Proprietary interests in Company will not be preserved to the extent that:
(i) consideration received prior to the Merger, either in a redemption of
Company Stock or in a distribution with respect to Company Stock, is treated
as other property or money received in the exchange for purposes of Section
356, or would be so treated if the Company shareholder also had received
Parent Stock in exchange for Company Stock; (ii) Parent or a person related
to Parent as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3) (a "Parent
Related Person") acquires Company Stock for consideration other than Parent
Stock in connection with the merger; or (iii) Parent Stock received in the
Merger in exchange for Company Stock is redeemed or otherwise acquired by
Parent or a Parent Related Person for consideration other than Parent Stock
in connection with the Merger, other than acquisitions which are made on the
open market through a broker at the prevailing market price from a
shareholder whose identity is not known to Parent and are made pursuant to
a stock repurchase program that was not a matter negotiated with Company or
any Company shareholder, does not favor participation by any Company
shareholder and pursuant to which the number of shares repurchased does not
exceed the number of Parent shares outstanding prior to the Merger (a "Parent
Stock Repurchase Program"). Parent is not aware of any extraordinary
distribution with respect to Company Stock that has occurred or is intended,
in each case, in connection with the Merger. Parent also has not
participated, and in connection with the Merger, will not participate, in a
redemption or acquisition of Company Stock made by Company or a person
related to Company as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3) (a
"Company Related Person"). Any reference to Parent or Company in this
paragraph includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of
such corporation, except that Company is not treated as a predecessor of
Parent and Parent is not treated as a successor of Company. Each partner of a
partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any stock owned or
acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as having paid any
consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock) in accordance
with that partner\'s interest in the partnership. For purposes of this
Officer\'s Certificate, an acquisition of Parent Stock or Company Stock by a
person pursuant to any transaction, agreement, arrangement or other
understanding with Parent, Company, a Parent Related Person or a Company
Related Person will be treated as made by Parent, Company, the Parent Related
Person or the Company Related Person, respectively. Parent has no plan or
intention to reacquire any of its stock issued in the Merger, either directly
or through any transaction, agreement, arrangement or other understanding
with a Parent Related Person, except for any plan or intention to reacquire
such stock pursuant to the Parent Stock Repurchase Plan.   6. Other than
transactions described in the Transfer Agreement, Parent has no present plan
or intention to (i) liquidate the Company, (ii) merge the Company with or
into another corporation or entity (or to convert the Company into a
"disregarded" entity within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section
301.7701-3), (iii) sell or otherwise dispose of any stock of the Company,
except for transfers (including successive transfers) of such stock
to corporations controlled by the transferor, or (iv) cause the Company to
sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets, or any assets that it
acquired from Merger Sub, except for (w) dispositions in the ordinary course
of its business, (x) transactions described in the Transfer Agreement, (y)
transfers (including successive transfers) of assets to one or more
corporations controlled in each transfer by the transferor or transfers
permitted under Treasury Regulation sections 1.368-2(f), -2(k) and -1(d)(4),
or (z) arm\'s length dispositions to persons not related to Parent other than
dispositions which would result in Parent ceasing to use a significant
portion of the Company\'s historic business assets in a business and provided
that the consideration is retained or reinvested in the business. Parent has
no plan or intention to cause the Company to issue any additional shares of
stock following the Merger, or take any other action, that could result in
Parent losing control of the Company following the Merger. For purposes of
this paragraph, control with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of
at least (i) 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock
entitled to vote, and (ii) 80% of the total number of shares of each other
class of stock of the corporation.   7. Following the Merger, the Company,
Parent or another member of Parent\'s "qualified group" will continue the
Company\'s historic business or use a significant portion of the Company\'s
historic business assets in a business. For purposes of this representation,
Parent\'s "qualified group" means one or more chains of corporations
connected through stock ownership with the Parent, but only if the Parent
directly owns at least (i) 80% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock entitled to vote, and (ii) 80% of the total number of shares
of each other class of stock, in at least one other corporation, and at least
(x) 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled
to vote, and (y) 80% of the total number of shares of each other class of
stock, in each of the corporations (except Parent) is owned directly by one
of the other corporations. For purposes of this test, Parent and such members
(i) shall be deemed to own that portion of the assets of a partnership
reflecting their interest therein, and (ii) shall be treated as conducting
the business of a partnership of which they are members, provided that (A)
they own in the aggregate at least a 33 1/3% capital and profits interest in
such partnership, or (B) they own in the aggregate at least a 20% capital and
profits interest in such partnership and perform active and substantial
management functions with respect thereto.   8. Prior to the Merger and at
the Effective Time, Parent will own all of the outstanding stock of Merger
Sub. Parent has no plan or intention to cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub
has no plan or intention to, issue additional shares of its stock that would
result in Parent owning less than all of the capital stock of Merger Sub.  
9. Merger Sub has been newly formed solely to effect the Merger and at no
time has or will Merger Sub conduct any business or other activities
other than the issuance of its stock to Parent prior to the Merger or
activities necessary to effectuate the Merger. Merger Sub will have no
liabilities that will be assumed by the Company and it will not transfer any
assets to the Company in the Merger that are subject to any liabilities.  
10. Pursuant to the Merger, at least (i) 80% of the total combined voting
power of all classes of Company stock entitled to vote and (ii) 80% of each
other class of stock of the Company will be exchanged solely for
voting Parent Stock. For purposes of this representation, shares of Company
Stock exchanged for cash or other property originating with Parent or Merger
Sub will be treated as outstanding Company Stock at the Effective Time.  
11. Except as provided in the Merger Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and holders of Company Stock will each pay their respective expenses,
if any, incurred in connection with the Merger. To the extent any expenses
related to the Merger will be funded directly or indirectly by a party other
than the incurring party, such expenses will be solely and directly related
to the Merger, and will not include (i) expenses incurred for investment or
estate planning advice to shareholders or (ii) expenses incurred by
an individual shareholder or group of shareholders for legal, accounting
or investment advice or counsel relating to the Merger. Parent has not agreed
to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or
other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Company Stock
in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related transaction;
provided further that all liability for Taxes incurred by a holder of Company
Stock will be paid by such shareholder of the Company and in no event by
Parent or a related person, directly or indirectly.   12. There is no and
will be no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or its
subsidiaries and the Company or its subsidiaries that was issued, acquired or
will be settled at a discount.   13. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub will (i)
elect, or have in effect an election, to be treated as a "regulated
investment company" or as a "real estate investment trust," or (ii) be an
"investment company" as defined in section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the
Code.   14. As of the Effective Time, the only Company Stock, or
other securities, options, warrants or instruments giving Parent the right to
acquire Company Stock held by Parent is (i) 97,472.84 shares of the Company
Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) 90,668.33 shares of the Company Series B
Preferred Stock, (iii) 3,070.58 shares of the Company Series C Preferred
Stock, (iv) 49,416.98 shares of the Company Series D Preferred Stock, (v)
14,912,778 shares of the Company Series F preferred stock, (vi) 46,374 shares
of the Company Series G Preferred Stock, (vii) 18,288,835 shares of the
Company Class A Common Stock, (viii) 20,902 shares of the Company Class D
Common Stock, and (iv) 2,309.31 shares of the Company Class F Common
Stock.   15. The Parent Stock into which the Company Stock will be
converted in the Merger will be "voting stock" within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code.   16. None of the compensation to be received by any
shareholder- employee of the Company will be separate consideration for, or
allocable to, any of such employee\'s shares of Company Stock; none of the
Parent Stock to be received by any shareholder-employee of the Company in
connection with the Merger will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any employment, consulting or similar agreement; and the compensation
paid to any shareholder-employee of the Company will be for services actually
rendered and will be determined by bargaining at arm\'s length.   17. The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock is solely for
the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing
fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-
for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the
Merger to holders of Company Stock instead of issuing fractional shares of
Parent Stock is not expected to exceed 1% of the total consideration that
will be issued in the Merger to the Company shareholders in exchange for
their shares of Company Stock. The fractional share interests of each Company
shareholder will be aggregated, and no Company shareholder, with the possible
exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with
multiple brokers, will receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than one
full share of Parent Stock.   18. Parent is not aware of, and has not
participated in, any plan of the Company (or a person related to the Company)
to effect (i) an extraordinary distribution with respect to Company Stock or
(ii) any redemption or acquisition of Company Stock (other than the
acquisition of Company Stock in the Merger).   19. At the time of the merger
of Titan with [Tap] on November 13, 2000 neither Parent nor, to the best
knowledge of Parent\'s management, the Company\'s management, had any plan or
expectation, to effect, or engaged in any discussions, negotiations,
agreements or arrangements regarding, the Merger.   20. At the Effective
Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub will be under the jurisdiction of a court
in a "Title 11 or similar case". For purposes of the foregoing, a "Title 11
or similar case" means a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or a
receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a Federal or state
court.   21. The undersigned is authorized to make all the
representations set forth herein on behalf of Parent.   We understand that
Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz will rely,
without further inquiry, on this representation letter in rendering their
respective opinions as to certain United States Federal income tax
consequences of the Merger. We will promptly and timely inform them if, after
signing this representation letter, we have reason to believe that any of the
facts described herein or in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or any of the
representations made in this representation letter are or have become untrue,
incorrect or incomplete in any respect.   Very truly yours,

West 52nd Street New York, New York 10019-6150  Re: The Merger of [Merger
Sub] with and into [Titan] 
------------------------------------------------  Ladies and Gentlemen:  
In connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated [_____], by and among [Apple],
a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), [Merger Sub], a Delaware corporation and a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and [Titan], a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the undersigned certifies
and represents on behalf of the Company and as to the Company, after due
inquiry and investigation, as follows (any capitalized term used but not
defined herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the Merger
Agreement):   1. The facts relating to the contemplated merger (the
"Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, as described in the Merger Agreement and the documents described
in the Merger Agreement are, insofar as such facts pertain to the Company,
true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Merger will be
consummated strictly in accordance with the Merger Agreement and none of the
material terms and conditions therein related to the Merger has been or will
be waived or modified. The facts that relate to the Merger and related
transactions, as described in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed in
connection with the Merger and the proxy statement-prospectus (the "Proxy
Statement-Prospectus") contained therein, each as amended or supplemented
through the date hereof, are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects and will be true, correct, and complete in all material respects at
the Effective Time. The Merger is being effected for bona fide business
reasons.   2. The fair market value of the voting common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), the Series C Preferred
Stock of Parent (the "Parent Series C Preferred Stock") to be designated as
having terms substantially as set forth in the form of the Series C Preferred
Certificate of Designation attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement, and
the Preferred Stock of Parent to be designated as Series E Preferred Stock of
Parent, having terms substantially as set forth in the form of the Series E
Preferred Certificate of Designation attached as Exhibit B to the Merger
Agreement (together with the Parent Series C Preferred Stock, the "Parent
Preferred Stock"; the Parent Common Stock and the Parent Preferred Stock, the
"Parent Stock"), and cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock
received by each shareholder of the Company in the Merger will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the Class A Voting Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Class A Common
Stock"), the Class C Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the "Company Class C Common Stock"), the Class D Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Class D Common Stock"), the
Class E Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Class E Common Stock"), the Class F Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Company (the "Company Class F Common Stock"), and the Voting
Preference Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Voting Preference Common Stock", and together with the Company Class
A Common Stock, the Company Class C Common Stock, the Company Class D Common
Stock, the Company Class E Common Stock, and the Company Class F
Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock), and the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Series A Preferred Stock"), the Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Series B Preferred Stock"), the Series C
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Series C Preferred Stock"), the Series D Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Series D Preferred Stock, the Series E
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Series E Preferred Stock"), the Series F Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Series F Preferred Stock"), and the
Series G Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
Company Series G Preferred Stock", together with the Company Common Stock,
the Company Series A Preferred Stock, the Company Series B Preferred Stock,
the Company Series C Preferred Stock, the Company Series D Preferred Stock,
the Company Series E Preferred Stock, and the Company Series F Preferred
Stock, the "Company Stock"), surrendered in exchange therefore.
The consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Company Stock
was determined by arm\'s length negotiations between the managements of
Parent and the Company.   3. In connection with the Merger, no holder of
Company Stock will receive in exchange for Company Stock, directly or
indirectly, any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub other than Parent
Stock, cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof, and cash paid to
dissenting shareholders of the Company.   4. At least 50 percent of the
value of the shareholders\' proprietary interests in Company will be
preserved as a proprietary interest in Parent received in exchange for
Company Stock. Proprietary interests in Company will not be preserved to the
extent that: (i) consideration received prior to the Merger, either in a
redemption of Company Stock or in a distribution with respect to Company
Stock, is treated as other property or money received in the exchange for
purposes of Section 356, or would be so treated if the Company shareholder
also had received Parent Stock in exchange for Company Stock; (ii) Parent or
a person related to Parent as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(e)(3) (a "Parent Related Person") acquires Company Stock
for consideration other than Parent Stock in connection with the Merger; or
(iii) Parent Stock received in the Merger in exchange for Company Stock is
redeemed or otherwise acquired by Parent or a Parent Related Person for
consideration other than Parent Stock in connection with the Merger, other
than acquisitions which are made on the open market through a broker at the
prevailing market price from a shareholder whose identity is not known to
Parent and are made pursuant to a stock repurchase program that was not a
matter negotiated with Company or any Company shareholder, does not favor
participation by any Company shareholder and pursuant to which the number of
shares repurchased does not exceed the number of Parent shares outstanding
prior to the Merger. Company has not caused, and in connection with the
Merger, will not cause, an extraordinary distribution with respect to its
shares to occur. Neither Company nor a person related to Company as defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3) (a "Company Related Person") has
participated, in connection with the Merger, nor will it so participate, in a
redemption or acquisition of Company Stock. Neither Company, any Company
Related Person nor any affiliate of Company, has paid or will pay, in
connection with the Merger, any amount to, or on behalf of, any
Company shareholder in connection with any sale, redemption or other
disposition of any Company Stock. Any reference to Parent or Company in this
paragraph includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of such
corporation, except that Company is not treated as a predecessor of Parent
and Parent is not treated as a successor of Company. Each partner of a
partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any stock owned or
acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as having paid any
consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock) in accordance
with that partner\'s interest in the partnership. For purposes of this
Officer\'s Certificate, an acquisition of Parent Stock or Company Stock by a
person pursuant to any transaction, agreement, arrangement or other
understanding with Parent, Company, a Parent Related Person or a
Company Related Person will be treated as made by Parent, Company, the Parent
Related Person or the Company Related Person, respectively. It is understood
for purposes of this representation that 3 shares of Titan Voting Preference
Stock held by William M. Mounger, II may be put to [Tap] after November 13,
2001.   5. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Stock is made solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent
separately bargained for consideration. The total cash consideration that
will be paid in the Merger to holders of Company Stock instead of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Stock is not expected to exceed 1% of the total
consideration that will be issued in the Merger to the Company shareholders
in exchange for their shares of Company Stock. The fractional share interests
of each Company shareholder will be aggregated, and no Company shareholder,
with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple
accounts or with multiple brokers, will receive cash in an amount equal to or
greater than one full share of Parent Stock.   6. The Company has no plan
or intention to issue any additional shares of stock that would cause Parent
to own less than (i) 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
Company stock entitled to vote, or (ii) 80% of each other class of stock in
the Company.   7. The Company has not made and does not have any present
plan or intention to make any distributions (other than dividends made in the
ordinary course of business) prior to, in contemplation of or otherwise in
connection with, the Merger.   8. Immediately following the Merger, the
Company will hold (i) at least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets
and at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets that were held
by the Company immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this
representation, amounts used to repay debt, amounts paid by the Company to
shareholders who receive cash or other property (including cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Stock) in connection with the Merger, and all
redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by
the Company immediately preceding, or in contemplation of, the Merger,
including any dispositions described in the Transfer Agreement, will be
considered assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger. Any
dispositions of assets held by the Company prior to the Merger which are made
in contemplation of, or as part of the Merger will be for fair market value,
and the proceeds thereof will be retained by the Company.   9. At the
Effective Time, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options,
convertible securities or any other type of right pursuant to which any
person could acquire Company Stock that, if exercised or converted, would
affect Parent\'s acquisition or retention of control of the Company,
as defined in Section 368(c) of the Code.   10. As of the date hereof, the
only capital stock of the Company is the Company Stock. Since the date of the
Merger Agreement the Company has not issued any additional shares of Company
Stock. The Company Stock is "voting stock" within the meaning of Section 368
of the Code.   11. Except as provided in the Merger Agreement, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and holders of Company Stock will each pay their
respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger. To the
extent any expenses related to the Merger will be funded directly or
indirectly by a party other than the incurring party, such expenses will be
solely and directly related to the Merger, and will not include (i) expenses
incurred for investment or estate planning advice to shareholders or (ii)
expenses incurred by an individual shareholder or group of shareholders for
legal, accounting or investment advice or counsel relating to the Merger.
Parent has not agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume,
any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of
Company Stock in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related
transaction; provided further that all liability for Taxes incurred by a
holder of Company Stock will be paid by such shareholder of the Company and
in no event by Parent or a related person, directly or indirectly.   12.
Pursuant to the Merger, at least (i) 80% of the total combined voting power
of all classes of Company stock entitled to vote, and (ii) 80% of each other
class of stock of the Company, will be exchanged solely for voting Parent
Stock. For purposes of this representation, shares of the Company
Stock exchanged for cash or other property originating with the Parent or
Merger Sub will be treated as outstanding Company Stock on the date of the
Merger.   13. To the best knowledge of the management of the Company,
Parent will neither (i) assume any liabilities of the shareholders of the
Company in the Merger, nor (ii) take subject to any liabilities any Company
Stock acquired in the Merger. Furthermore, to the knowledge of the management
of the Company, there is no plan or intention for Parent to assume any
liabilities of the Company.   14. The Company will not (i) elect, or have
in effect an election, to be treated as a "regulated investment company" or
as a "real estate investment trust," or (ii) be an "investment company" as
defined in section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.   15. None of
the compensation to be received by any shareholder- employee of the Company
will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of such employee\'s
shares of Company Stock; none of the Parent Stock to be received by any
shareholder-employee of the Company in connection with the Merger will be
separate consideration for, or allocable to any employment, consulting or
similar agreement; and the compensation paid to any shareholder-employee of
the Company will be for services actually rendered and will be determined by
bargaining at arm\'s-length.   16. There is no intercorporate indebtedness
existing between Parent or its subsidiaries, and the Company or its
subsidiaries that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount.  
17. At the Effective Time, the Company will not be under the jurisdiction of
a court in a "Title 11 or similar case". For purposes of the foregoing, a
"Title 11 or similar case" means a case under Title 11 of the United States
Code or a receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a Federal or
state court.   18. No assets of the Company have been sold, transferred
or otherwise disposed of which would prevent Parent from continuing the
"historic business" of the Company or from using a significant portion of the
"historic business assets" of the Company in a business following the Merger
(as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)).  
19. The merger of Titan with [Tap] on November 13, 2000 (the "Titan-[Tap]
Merger") was motivated by a business purpose separate from and unrelated to
the Merger. At the time of the Titan-[Tap] Merger neither the Company nor, to
the best knowledge of the Company\'s management, Parent\'s management, had
any plan or expectation, to effect, or engaged in any discussions,
negotiations, agreements or arrangements regarding, the Merger.   20. On the
date of the Merger, the fair market value of the assets of the Company will
exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which such assets are subject.   21. The undersigned is authorized to make
all the representations set forth herein on behalf of the Company.   We
understand that Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and
Katz will rely, without further inquiry, on this representation letter in
rendering their respective opinions as to certain United States Federal
income tax consequences of the Merger. We will promptly and timely inform
them if, after signing this representation letter, we have reason to believe
that any of the facts described herein or in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus
or any of the representations made in this representation letter are or have
become untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any respect.   Very truly
yours,     [TITAN]   by ____________________________________  Name:

Title:     Execution Copy    Put-Call Agreement, dated as of October 7,
2001, between Skagit Wireless, LLC, an Oregon limited liability company
("Skagit"), and RW Acquisition, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
("RWA") and a wholly owned subsidiary of TeleCorp PCS, Inc. ("TeleCorp").  
Whereas, RWA and Skagit have entered into an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Assignment"),
pursuant to which RWA has assigned to Skagit, and Skagit has assumed, all of
the right, title and interest of RWA in and to the Settlement Agreement and
the Collective Plan (as such terms are defined in the Assignment);  
Whereas, TeleCorp has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), with ATandT; Wireless
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AWS"), and one of its
subsidiaries;   Whereas, RWA wishes to have the right to purchase, and
Skagit wishes to have the right to cause RWA to purchase, all of the right,
title and interest of Skagit in and to (i) the Settlement Agreement and the
Collective Plan (the "Subject Rights") or (ii) any FCC licenses that Skagit
may acquire pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the Collective Plan (the
"Subject Licenses"), as the case may be, in the event that the Merger
Agreement is terminated.   Now, therefore, the parties hereby agree as
follows:   1. Right to Call  -------------   RWA shall have the right,
exercisable at any time prior to the 91st day following the termination of
the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, to purchase from Skagit
the Subject Rights or all of the Subject Licenses, as the case may be.   2.
Right to Put  ------------   Skagit shall have the right, exercisable at
any time within 90 days following the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, to cause RWA to purchase from Skagit the Subject
Rights or all of the Subject Licenses, as the case may be; provided, that RWA
shall not be required to effect such purchase if, prior to the expiration of
such 90-day period, (i) AWS shall have been relieved of any contractual
prohibitions or limitations for the benefit of TeleCorp and its shareholders
(whether relating to exclusivity or preferential roaming obligations or
otherwise) on AWS\'s right to provide mobile wireless communications services
under the AWS brand in that portion of TeleCorp\'s territory covered by the
Subject Licenses or (ii) AWS fails to consent to the amendment of any
agreement to which it is a party that would effect such relief, and that does
not otherwise adversely affect the rights or benefits of AWS thereunder.  
3. Purchase Price  --------------   The consideration payable by RWA
pursuant to Section 1 or 2, as the case may be, will be (i) for the Subject
Rights, the execution and delivery by RWA of an assignment and assumption
agreement in substantially the form of the Assignment, and (ii) for the
Subject Licenses, the purchase price therefor actually paid by Skagit.   4.
Exercise of Rights  ------------------   The party exercising its rights
under Section 1 or 2, as the case may be, must send a written notice to the
other party within the applicable time period, and thereafter the parties
will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated under Section 1 or Section 2, as the
case may be.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
purchase and sale of the Subject Rights will be effected pursuant to an
assignment and assumption agreement in substantially the form of the
Assignment, and the purchase and sale of Subject Licenses will be effected
pursuant to a mutually satisfactory license acquisition agreement that
contains terms and conditions that are customary in the industry for similar
transactions.   5. Miscellaneous  -------------   This Agreement, when
read together with the Assignment, embodies the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof, and
supersedes any prior agreements or understandings with respect to such
subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written
instrument executed by the parties. This Agreement may not be assigned by
either party without the prior written consent of the other party.
This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New
York, without regard to choice of law principles.   6. Notices

dated as November 13, 2000 ("Management Agreement") and (B) Management\'s
highest Annual Bonus (as defined in the Management Agreement) earned for the
last three full fiscal years prior to the Closing Date (or for such lesser

the Company for any reason other than pursuant to Sections 5(b)(ii)(A) or
5(b)(ii)(E) of the Management Agreement prior to the Closing Date, (3) you

incapacity due to mental or physical illness.  The provisions of this
letter agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall not reduce
any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish your rights under any
employee benefit plan or employment agreement or other contract, plan or
arrangement nor shall any amounts payable hereunder be treated as
compensation for purposes of any benefit formula under any such
plan, agreement or contract; provided, however, you agree that neither the
execution of the Merger Agreement nor any actions taken by the Company in
fulfillment of its obligations thereunder, alone or in conjunction with any
other event, shall give rise to any termination right either of you or

Management might otherwise have to do so prior to or following the Closing
Date. In addition, you agree to terminate, or to cause Management to

to the date of termination of the Management Agreement.  This letter
agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.  This letter
agreement shall not be construed as conferring upon either of you
or Management any legal rights with respect to a continuation of your
employment or other relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries.  No
provision of this letter agreement may be modified, waived or
discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in
writing signed by each of you and the Company. No waiver by either party
hereto at any time of any breach of the other party hereto of, or compliance

such party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or
representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the
subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth
expressly in this letter agreement.   On the Closing Date, this letter
agreement shall be assigned to Wireless, or its successor, and Wireless shall
