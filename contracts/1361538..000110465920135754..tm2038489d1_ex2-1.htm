Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in accordance with the Act (the " _Merger_ "), and the
board of managers of the Company has declared that it is advisable and in the

Merger be adopted and approved by the members of the Company;

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, in its capacity as the sole member of Merger Sub, has
approved this Agreement and the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and material inducement to the willingness of the Buyer to

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  



  

THE MERGER

  



  

1.01 _The Merger_. On and subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, and in accordance with the Act, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving
the Merger (the Company, as the surviving company after the Effective Time,
is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Company_ ").

  



  

1.02 _Filing of Merger Certificate; Effective Time_. At the
Closing, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in 
_ARTICLE VII_, (i) the Company will execute a certificate of merger in
substantially the form of _Exhibit A _attached hereto (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act, and (ii)
the Company and Merger Sub will, and Buyer will cause Merger Sub to, cause
such executed Certificate of Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with the Act, and the Merger will be
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be
agreed in writing by Buyer and the Company and specified therein (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  



   



 



    



  



  

1.03 _Effect of the Merger; Further Assurances_.

  



  

(a) The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement,
the Certificate of Merger and in the applicable provisions of the Act. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company determines that any
further documents or acts are necessary to vest in the Surviving Company the
title to any property or right of the Constituent Companies acquired in
the Merger or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
Surviving Company and its officers and directors will execute and deliver all
such documents and do all such acts, and the officers and directors of the
Surviving Company are fully authorized in the name of the Constituent
Companies or otherwise to take any and all such action after the
Effective Time solely for the purposes set forth in this _Section 1.03_, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Certificate of Merger shall provide that at the Effective
Time, the certificate of formation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of formation
of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended or repealed in accordance
with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
operation of law and without any further action by any Person, be the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company, until thereafter
amended or repealed in accordance with the provisions thereof, the certificate
of formation of the Surviving Company and applicable Law.

  



  

(d) The officers of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Company until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified in the manner
provided in the certificate of formation and the limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Company, their earlier resignation or removal or as
otherwise provided by applicable Law.

  



  

1.04 _Conversion of Units_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the Class A Common Units or Class B
Units described in this _Section 1.04_:

  



  

(a) Each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one (1) validly issued limited liability company interest of
the Surviving Company.

  



  

(b) Each Class A Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Class A Common Units cancelled
pursuant to _Section 1.04(d)_) will be converted into the right to receive,
upon delivery of a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, the
Closing Per Unit Amount plus amounts payable with respect to such Class A
Common Unit pursuant to _Section 1.07(e)_, and will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(c) Each Class B Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, regardless of whether vesting occurs pursuant to the
terms of the associated equity purchase agreement or at the election of the
Company\'s board of managers or as otherwise permitted (other than Class B
Units to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.04(d)_) will be converted into,
upon delivery of a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, the
Closing Per Unit Amount less the Participation Threshold attributable to such
Class B Unit plus amounts payable with respect to such Class B Unit pursuant
to _Section 1.07(e)_, and will automatically be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist.

  



  

(d) Each Class A Common Unit and Class B Unit held in the treasury
of the Company and each Class A Common Unit and Class B Unit owned or held,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or by Buyer, Merger Sub or their
respective Subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist without any
conversion thereof and no payment of cash or any other consideration will be
made with respect thereto.

  



  

1.05 _Pre-Closing Merger Consideration Estimate_.

  



  

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company will prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the  " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a calculation of (1) the estimated Closing
Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (2)
the estimated Closing Cash (the  " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (3) the
estimated Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "),
(4) the estimated Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_
"), (5) the Company\'s calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration
derived from the foregoing, and (6) the Closing Per Unit Amount, in
accordance with _Section 1.05(b)_ and _Section 1.05(c)_, respectively.
The Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared, and the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness,
and Estimated Transaction Expenses will be determined, in each case, in good
faith, in accordance with the definitions set forth in this Agreement using
the specific policies as set forth on _Exhibit B_ (the policies set forth on
_Exhibit B_, the " _Accounting Principles_ "). The Company will provide
the Buyer with all detail, supporting calculations and supporting
documentation relating to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement
reasonably requested by the Buyer. The Buyer may review and comment upon the
Estimated Closing Statement, which comments, if any, shall be delivered to
the Company no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date and
which comments the Company shall consider in good faith; provided, however,
that if there is any dispute regarding the calculation of any of the
components in the Estimated Closing Statement prior to the Closing Date, the
Company\'s determination thereof shall control (subject, for the avoidance of
doubt, to the provisions of _Section 1.07_ regarding the determination of
the Merger Consideration).

  



  

(b) The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Class A
Common Unitholder will be entitled to receive at the Closing (the  " _Closing
Class A Common Unit Payment_") will equal the product of (i) Closing Per Unit
Amount _multiplied_  by (ii) the number of Class A Common Units held by such
Class A Common Unitholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



   

7

 



    



  

(c) The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Class B
Unitholder will be entitled to receive at the Closing (the " _Closing Class
B Unit Payment_") will equal the product of (i) the result of (x) the Closing
Per Unit Amount less (y) the average Participation Threshold attributable to
the Participating Class B Units held by such Class B Unitholder  _multiplied_
by (ii) the number of Participating Class B Units held by such Class B
Unitholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

1.06 _Closing Payments_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to,
deposit with the Paying Agent the aggregate Closing Class A Common Unit
Payment and Closing Class B Unit Payment, payable to the Class A Common
Unitholders and Class B Unitholders, respectively, as set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated by the Paying Agent no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to,
deliver to the Escrow Agent (i) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Deposit
Amount and (ii) the Pride Utility Escrow Amount, in each case, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a separate escrow account
designated by the Escrow Agent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (the account to which the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Deposit Amount is funded, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account_
" and the account to which the Pride Utility Escrow Amount is funded, the "
_Pride Utility Escrow Account_ ") and established pursuant to the terms of
the escrow agreement to be dated as of the Closing Date and substantially in
the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), by and
among Buyer, the Representative and the Escrow Agent.

  



  

(c) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to
pay, to the Representative, the Representative Holdback Amount, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Representative at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to
pay, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all Estimated
Transaction Expenses to such Persons as they are owed by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to accounts designated by the Company at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to
pay, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts required to
be paid under the payoff letters delivered pursuant to _Section 5.08_ to
fully discharge the Indebtedness owed to the Persons thereunder, as described
therein, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated in such payoff letters.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(f) In accordance with the paying agent agreement to be dated on
or prior to the Closing Date and substantially in the form of _Exhibit
D _attached hereto (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), the Paying Agent will
act as the Representative\'s agent in delivering to each Class A Common
Unitholder and Class B Unitholder its respective Closing Class A Common
Unit Payment or Closing Class B Unit Payment, as applicable, as well as any
amounts owed to such Class A Common Unitholders or Class B Unitholders
pursuant to _Section 1.07(e)_. At or after the Effective Time, upon delivery
by a Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder of a duly executed
letter of transmittal substantially in the form of _Exhibit E _attached
hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") to the Paying Agent, (i) the Paying
Agent will pay each such Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder the
Closing Class A Common Unit Payment or Closing Class B Unit Payment to which
such Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder is entitled under Section
1.05 as set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement and (ii) each Class A
Common Unitholder and Class B Unitholder will be irrevocably entitled to
receive the portion of any amount payable under _Section 1.07(e)_ with
respect to such Class A Common Units or Class B Units held by such Class A
Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The Closing Class A Common Unit Payment or Closing Class B Unit Payment
payable to a Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder will be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by such Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder in the Letter
of Transmittal, unless alternative arrangements are specified by such holder
in the Letter of Transmittal, to the extent permitted by the Letter of
Transmittal. Each such Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder that
makes the deliveries to the Paying Agent required by this Agreement and the
Paying Agent Agreement prior to the Closing Date will be paid his, her or its
applicable Closing Class A Common Unit Payment or Closing Class B Unit
Payment on the same Business Day as the Effective Time, or as soon as
possible thereafter. Each such Class A Common Unitholder or Class B
Unitholder that makes the deliveries to the Paying Agent required by this
Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement on or after the Closing Date will be
paid his, her or its applicable Closing Class A Common Unit Payment or
Closing Class B Unit Payment as soon as possible after delivery thereof is
made (but in any event no later than two (2) Business Days after the date
such delivery thereof is made).

  



  

(g) At any time that is more than one (1) year after the Effective
Time, Buyer may cause the Paying Agent to pay over to the Surviving Company
any portion of the Closing Class A Common Unit Payment or Closing Class B Unit
Payment that had been delivered to the Paying Agent (including any interest
received thereon) and that has not been disbursed to Class A Common
Unitholders or Class B Unitholders as of such date (other than any amounts
then subject to dispute). After the Paying Agent makes such payments to the
Surviving Company, all former Class A Common Unitholders and Class B
Unitholders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Company (subject
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the cash payable pursuant to this
Agreement. None of the Surviving Company, Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Representative or the Paying Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of
amounts paid to a Governmental Body to the extent required under any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

1.07 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Following
the Closing Date, the Estimated Merger Consideration will be adjusted, if
at all, as set forth below:

  



   

9

 



    



  

(a) Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Representative within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ "), together with reasonable supporting documentation and
detail, setting forth a calculation of (1) Closing Net Working Capital, (2)
Closing Cash, (3) Closing Indebtedness, (4) the Transaction Expenses, (5)
Buyer\'s calculation of the Final Merger Consideration derived from the
foregoing, and (6) with respect to each of the foregoing, the changes in such
amounts from the corresponding amounts on the Estimated Closing Statement. The
Closing Statement will be prepared, and Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses will be determined in
accordance with the definitions set forth in this Agreement, using the
Accounting Principles. The parties hereto agree that the purpose of
preparing the Closing Statement and calculating Final Merger Consideration is
solely to (x) accurately measure the amount of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and (y) measure
the difference in (1) Closing Net Working Capital from Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, (2) Closing Cash from Estimated Closing Cash, (3)
Closing Indebtedness from Estimated Closing Indebtedness and (4) Transaction
Expenses from Estimated Transaction Expenses, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of calculating Final Merger
Consideration than were used in the calculation of Estimated Merger
Consideration. If the Buyer fails to deliver to the Representative the Closing
Statement within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Representative
may, in its sole discretion, elect to deem that the Estimated Merger
Consideration set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement constitutes the
Final Merger Consideration for all purposes of this _Section 1.07_.

  



  

(b) On or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day following Buyer\'s
delivery of the Closing Statement, the Representative may give Buyer
a written notice stating in reasonable detail the Representative\'s
objections (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Closing Statement. During
such 60-day period, and any period of dispute thereafter with respect to such
Closing Statement, Buyer will, and will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) provide the Representative and its Advisors with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting
data, facilities and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including Company personnel responsible for accounting and finance and
senior management) and the Company\'s Advisors and their work papers and (ii)
otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist the Representative and its
Advisors in connection with such review; _provided_ that the Representative
and its Advisors shall conduct any such review in a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of Buyer, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries and shall comply with all applicable
safety rules and reasonable controls during such access. Any determination set
forth on the Closing Statement which is not specifically objected to in the
Notice of Disagreement will be deemed accepted by the Representative, and
will be final and binding upon all parties upon delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement. If the Representative does not deliver to Buyer a Notice of
Disagreement within such 60-day period, then the Closing Statement and the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and
Transaction Expenses will be final and binding upon the parties upon the
expiration of such 60-day period, and the Final Merger Consideration set forth
in the Closing Statement will constitute the Final Merger Consideration for
all purposes of this _Section 1.07_.

(c) Following Buyer\'s receipt of any Notice of Disagreement, the
Representative and Buyer will attempt to negotiate in good faith to resolve
the disputed matters set forth therein. In the event that the Representative
and Buyer fail to agree on any of the Representative\'s proposed adjustments
set forth in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days after Buyer
receives the Notice of Disagreement, the Representative and Buyer agree to
appoint Deloitte, or, if such firm is not available, Representative and Buyer
agree to jointly select a nationally recognized accounting firm within forty-
five (45) days immediately following such 30-day period (Deloitte, or such
other firm jointly selected pursuant to this _Section 1.07(c)_, the " _Firm_
"), to make the final written determination of all matters which remain in
dispute that were included in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and the
Representative will instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make a final
determination of the items included in the Closing Statement (to the extent
such amounts are in dispute) solely in accordance with this Agreement. Buyer
and the Representative will execute a customary engagement letter and will
cooperate with the Firm during the term of its engagement. Buyer and the
Representative will instruct the Firm not to, and the Firm will not, assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand,
or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the
one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand. Buyer and the
Representative will also instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make its
determination based solely on written submissions by Buyer and the
Representative that are in accordance with this Agreement (i.e., not on the
basis of an independent review); _provided_ that the parties hereto agree that
no party shall have any ex parte communications with the Firm. The Closing
Statement and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, in each case, as determined by
the Firm in accordance with this _Section 1.07(c)_, will be final and
binding on the parties on the date the Firm delivers its final determination
in writing to Buyer and the Representative. The fees, costs and expenses of
the Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Representative, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Firm)
bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted. For example, if the
Representative submits a Notice of Disagreement for $1,000, and if Buyer
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if the
Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative $300 of
the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated
60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Representative.
Buyer and the Representative shall otherwise pay their own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any such dispute. The determination of Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses
by the Firm will be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
and will not be subject to appeal or further review.

  



  

(d) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration (such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Buyer and the
Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer (or its designee), within two (2)
Business Days after the date the Final Merger Consideration is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.07_ (such date, the " _Settlement
Date_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Excess Amount
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds. In the event that at such
time the Excess Amount is less than the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds (such shortfall, the " _Remaining Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds_ "), Buyer and the Representative will, simultaneously with delivery of
the instructions in the immediately foregoing sentence, deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay the
Remaining Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account to the Representative (or its designee), with all
such amounts received by the Representative (or its designee) pursuant to
this _Section 1.07(d)_, subject to _Section 10.19(b)_, to be paid to the
Class A Common Unitholders and the Class B Unitholders, as applicable, in
accordance with _Section 1.07(e)_. The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account is Buyer\'s, Merger Sub\'s and the Surviving Company\'s sole and
exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to Buyer, Merger Sub or,
after the Closing, the Surviving Company under this Agreement
(including pursuant to this _Section 1.07_ with respect to the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Funds).

  



   

11

 



    

  



  



  

(e) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration (such excess, the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), then (i) Buyer
will, within two (2) Business Days after the Settlement Date, make payment of
the lesser of (x) the $6,500,000 and (y) the Adjustment Amount (such amount,
the " _Paid Adjustment Amount_ ") by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the Representative (or its designee), and (ii) Buyer and the
Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to make payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, within two (2)
Business Days after the Settlement Date, to the Representative (or its
designee), with all such amounts received by the Representative (or its
designee) pursuant to this _Section 1.07(e)_, subject to _Section
10.19(b)_, to be paid to the Class A Common Unitholders and the Class B
Unitholders, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 1.07(e)_.

  



  

(f) When the Final Merger Consideration is finally determined
pursuant to _Section 1.07(b)_ or _Section 1.07(c)_, the Representative will
in good faith compute or re-compute, as the case may be, (i) the Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration, (ii) the Final Per Unit Amount and (iii) the
appropriate amount payable to each Class A Common Unitholder and each Class B
Unitholder based on the foregoing from the remaining Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds, the Paid Adjustment Amount and the Representative Holdback
Amount, taking into account amounts previously received by such Class A Common
Unitholders and such Class B Unitholders as Closing Class A Common Unit
Payment or Closing Class B Unit Payment, in each case, in accordance with
this Agreement. Promptly thereafter, the Representative will notify the Escrow
Agent and the Paying Agent, as applicable, of such calculations and the
amount that should be distributed by them to each Class A Common Unitholder
and Class B Unitholder based upon the calculations and re-calculations
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Class A Common Unitholder and Class B Unitholder will receive the
difference between (x) the amounts payable to such Class A Common Unitholder
and Class B Unitholder based upon the calculations and re-calculations
contemplated by this _Section 1.07(e)_ and (y) the Closing Class A Common
Unit Payment, the Closing Class B Unit Payment or any other post-Closing
payments received by such Class A Common Unitholder or such Class B
Unitholder, as applicable. The Representative, the Escrow Agent and the
Paying Agent, as applicable, will distribute such amounts, as applicable, in
accordance with the irrevocable written instructions so received from the
Representative. If, at the time of the calculation of the Final Adjusted
Merger Consideration, the Representative determines to retain funds in the
Representative Holdback Amount under _Section 10.19(b)_, and at any time and
from time to time thereafter determines a portion of such funds should be
distributed to the Class A Common Unitholders and the Class B Unitholders,
then at each such time, the Representative will in good faith determine the
appropriate amounts to be paid to the Class A Common Unitholders or the Class
B Unitholders from the Representative Holdback Amount and will cause such
amounts to be paid from the Representative Holdback Amount to the Class
A Common Unitholders or the Class B Unitholders. None of the Escrow Agent,
the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or Buyer will have any liability or
obligation to any Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder or the
Representative for any distribution made in accordance with the instructions
of the Representative pursuant to this _Section 1.07(e)_.

  



   

12

 



    



  

(g) Buyer and Merger Sub agree that the adjustments to the Final
Merger Consideration and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in
this _Section 1.07_ will be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed
or that could be addressed by this _Section 1.07_.

  



  

1.08 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as any of them determines it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts that are so deducted and
withheld shall be paid to the relevant Governmental Body and shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable
Person to which such consideration would have otherwise been payable. To the
extent that the Buyer determines that withholding is required on a payment to
any Person (other than payments that are wages or payments with respect to
which the Buyer determines that withholding is required because of a
Unitholder\'s failure to provide an IRS Form W-9 on a timely basis), Buyer
shall give prompt notice to the Representative and shall reasonably cooperate
in good faith with the Representative\'s efforts to mitigate such
withholding. Except to the extent required as a result of a change in tax law
that occurs after the date of this Agreement, the Buyer and Merger Sub agree
that for purposes of determining withholding under this _Section 1.08 _and
for filing Tax Returns, the Buyer and Merger Sub shall not treat any payment
pursuant to this Agreement to any Unitholder in respect of any Unit that was
issued prior to the date of this Agreement (or the vesting of any such Unit
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), as a
compensation event for any income or employment Tax purpose.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No investigation by any Governmental
Body with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to
the Company\'s knowledge, threatened in writing, which if determined adversely
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

3.10 _Tax Matters_. Except as set forth on the corresponding
subsection of _Schedule 3.10_:

  



  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all material Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by either the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and timely paid all material Taxes due (whether or not shown on
any Tax Return) by the Company or its Subsidiaries, and withheld all material
Taxes required to be withheld by the Company or its Subsidiaries. All such Tax
Returns have been properly completed in compliance with applicable Law and
are true, complete and accurate in all material respects as to matters
relating to the Taxes shown as payable.

  



  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not currently the
beneficiaries of any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return other than extensions automatically available by statute. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have adequately reserved in the Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP for all material Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax
Return) that have accrued but are not yet due or payable as of the dates
thereof. Since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for material Taxes outside the
ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and
practice (other than in connection with the payment of any expense ( _e.g._ ,
compensatory payments in respect of which employer payroll Taxes are required
to be paid) contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or the payment of any expense contemplated by the
acquisition agreement entered into by the Company pursuant to which
the Company acquired a Subsidiary).

adjustment or assessment asserted by a Governmental Body with respect to
Tax of the Company or any Subsidiary has been fully resolved or paid.

any extension of time with respect to the assessment or collection of any Tax
that is still effective. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

collection of any Tax. There are no powers of attorney in effect with respect
to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) There are no audits or other actions or proceedings (whether
administrative, regulatory or otherwise) that are ongoing relating to the
Taxes or the Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are
no matters under discussion with any Governmental Body with respect to the
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes that
would reasonably be expected to result in an additional liability for Taxes
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No rationale
underlying a claim for Taxes has been asserted previously by any Governmental
Body that reasonably could be expected to be asserted in any other period and
that likely would result in additional liability for Taxes with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are a party to or bound by
any closing agreement, gain recognition agreement, or other agreement with any
Governmental Body that could impact the Taxes payable by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date. No Tax ruling has been applied for or received by the Company
or any Subsidiary that could impact the amount of Taxes payable by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in a period (or portion thereof) beginning after

participated in or cooperated with, or has agreed to participate in or
cooperate with, any international boycott within the meaning of Section 999
of the Code.

  



  

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has employees
or other operations in a jurisdiction other than the United States.

  



  

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be

from, taxable income for any period (or any portion thereof) ending after the
Closing Date as a result of any installment sale or other transaction by the
Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) on or prior to the Closing Date, any

agreement with any Governmental Body entered into by the Company (or any of
its Subsidiaries) on or prior to the Closing Date, any prepaid amount
received by the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) on or prior to the
Closing.

party to a transaction that is a "reportable transaction," as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) (or any other
transaction requiring disclosure under analogous provisions of state or local

has been required to withhold or to collect for payment have been

Subsidiary has claimed an exemption or waiver from sales Taxes or withholding
Taxes, the Company and its Subsidiaries have received and retained, in
material compliance with all applicable legal requirements, all exemption
certificates, and any other documentation required to support such

with all information reporting and record keeping requirements under all
applicable Laws, including retention and maintenance of required records with
respect thereto.

any applicable Governmental Body related to any governmental response to

Taxes of any other Person (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) as a

Subsidiary as part of a plan to acquire such Subsidiary by the Company or
entities with respect to which the Subsidiary acquired all (or substantially)
all of its assets).

  



  

(t) Each unvested Unit that has been issued by the Company
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Unit that will vest in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (i)
satisfies all requirements necessary to be treated as a "profits interest"
under the safe harbor described in Revenue Procedure 93-27 and Revenue
Procedure 2001-43 or (ii) for any such Unit that does not satisfy all such
requirements, a timely Code Section 83(b) election was properly filed in
connection with the issuance of such Unit and all Taxes required to be paid
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (if any) in connection therewith
have been paid.

thereto, and the fee and engagement letters executed in connection therewith,
in each case as amended, supplemented or replaced in compliance with this

Commitment Letter is attached hereto as _Exhibit F_.

  



  

(c) At the Closing, Buyer and Merger Sub will have sufficient
funds with cash on hand, existing credit facilities (including

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly
and validly authorized by all requisite action by Buyer, Merger Sub and, to
the knowledge of Buyer and Merger Sub, each other Person party thereto, and

and the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been

Letter. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other
fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid by it on or prior to
the date of this Agreement and Buyer and Merger Sub will pay any and all such
fees as they become due.

  



  

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Merger Sub
(i) has reason to believe that any event has occurred that (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under
the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) is aware of any fact, event or other
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of Buyer
or Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material
respect and (iii) assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_, has reason to believe that any of

contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will not be made available on the

(g) Notwithstanding this _Section 4.09_ or any other provision of
this Agreement, each of Buyer and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement (including consummating the Merger) that Buyer or Merger Sub (or
the Surviving Company) obtain financing for or related to any of the
Transactions (including receipt of all or any portion of the proceeds of the

Transactions (including the incurrence of the Debt Financing), Buyer and each
of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries),

all contingent liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to
the Transactions (including the incurrence of the Debt Financing), Buyer and
each of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company), will have
adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the Transactions (including the incurrence of the Debt Financing) with
the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its

and delivery of this Agreement and its performance of its obligations
hereunder. All of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Merger Sub
are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Buyer. Except as expressly
authorized by written consent of the Company, neither Merger Sub nor any of
its Affiliates is a party to any contract or agreement, or has made or entered
into any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings (written or
oral and whether or not binding), with any member, director, officer or other
Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

proper or advisable in connection therewith and (iii) take all actions
necessary to obtain all required clearances. The parties agree that this
_Section 5.04 _(and not _Section 5.07_) sets forth the Company\'s sole
obligations with respect to regulatory filings, other than filings under the
HSR Act, which is governed solely by _Section 9.03_.

  



  

5.05 _Notification_. Until the Closing, the Company shall
promptly notify Buyer and Merger Sub in writing of any fact, change,
condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which
it is aware that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02 _becoming incapable
of being satisfied.

  



  

5.06 _Exclusivity_. From immediately after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and through the Closing (or the earlier termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_), Company will not take, and
the Company will cause its Subsidiaries not to take, any action to encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person (other than Buyer, Merger Sub and their respective
Advisors) concerning any merger or recapitalization involving the Company or
its Subsidiaries, sale of the equity interests of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, any sale of all or substantially all of the assets or equity
interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries or similar transaction involving
the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than inventory and equipment sold in
the ordinary course of business) (an  " _Acquisition Transaction_ "). The
Company will, and will cause the Seller Group and the Company\'s
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Advisors to,
terminate any and all negotiations or discussions with any third party
regarding any proposal concerning any Acquisition Transaction. The Company
shall notify Buyer promptly, but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours,
in writing if any inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect an
Acquisition Transaction is made. Any such notice to Buyer shall indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such inquiry or other
contact and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Transaction.

5.07 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement (including the limitations set forth in _Section 5.03_,  _Section
5.04_ and this _Section 5.07_), the Company will, and will cause each of the
Seller Group and the Company\'s Subsidiaries and Advisors to, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Transactions to be consummated as
promptly as practicable and not take any action intended to prevent, impede
or delay the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, the "reasonable best
efforts" of the Company will not require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Advisors to (a) expend any money to remedy any
breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, (b) commence any
litigation or arbitration proceeding, (c) waive or surrender any right to
modify any agreement (including any Material Contract), (d) offer or grant any
accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any third party, (e)
make any payment to third parties or otherwise suffer any similar detriment,
(f) subject to the Company\'s compliance with _Section 9.04 _and _Section _
_9.05_ , obtain any consent required for the consummation of the
Transactions, (g) waive or forego any right, remedy or condition hereunder,
or (h) provide financing to Buyer or Merger Sub for the consummation of the
Transactions (including all or any portion of the Debt Financing); _provided_
that the Seller Group and the Company will be permitted to grant
accommodations or concessions regarding any of the foregoing in its sole
discretion so long as such accommodations or concessions are included as
Transaction Expenses in the Estimated Closing Statement.

  



  

5.08 _Repayment of Indebtedness_. At least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver one or more customary
payoff letters in respect of the Indebtedness identified on _Schedule 5.08_
(the " _Payoff Indebtedness_ "), which payoff letters shall (A) specify the
amounts required to repay in full all such Payoff Indebtedness owed to the
Persons thereunder on the Closing Date, (B) specify the wire transfer
instructions for the repayment of such Payoff Indebtedness and (C) include a
release of any and all Liens incurred in connection with such Indebtedness on
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, effective upon receipt of the full
repayment amounts of such Payoff Indebtedness and any other customary
conditions set forth therein.

  



  

5.09 _Non-Compete Agreements_. If during the five (5)
Business Days following the date hereof Buyer informs the Company in writing
that it desires to have certain other members of the Company\'s management
team who are offered continued employment with Buyer and its Affiliates
following the Closing enter into a non-competition agreement with Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer, then the Company agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a non-competition agreement in form and substance
substantially similar to the form of non-competition agreement attached to the
Employment Agreements from each such additional member of the Company\'s
management team identified by Buyer during such time period; _provided_
, however, under no circumstances shall the Company or any member of the
Seller Group be required to pay any cost or incur any liabilities in
connection with securing the execution and delivery of such agreements under
this Section. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the execution and delivery
of any non-competition agreement is in the discretion of such applicable
member of the Company\'s management team, and in the event any such member of
the Company\'s management team declines to execute and deliver a non-
competition agreement pursuant to this _Section _ _5.09_ , the failure to
obtain a non-competition agreement from such member shall, subject to the
Company\'s compliance with the immediately preceding sentence, neither
constitute a breach of this _Section _ _5.09 _ nor constitute a failure
satisfy the condition set forth in _Section _ _7.02(b)_.

Article VI

  



  

COVENANTS OF BUYER AND MERGER SUB

  



  

6.01 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing,
for a period of seven (7) years, Buyer will, and will cause the Surviving
Company to provide the Representative (and its Advisors reasonably requiring
such access in light of the purposes therefor) with reasonable access, during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to the books and
records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the
Closing Date (including Tax Returns) as the Representative and its Advisors
may reasonably request in connection with any legitimate business purpose;
_provided_ , that the Representative and its Advisors shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as to not interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer and the
Surviving Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or
information if either Buyer or the Surviving Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party or jeopardize the
protection of the attorney-client privilege. For a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, before Buyer or the Surviving Company may destroy
or otherwise dispose of any of the material books and records of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries (including Tax Returns) for any period
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
give at least ninety (90) days\' prior written notice of such intention to
destroy or dispose to the Representative, and the Representative shall be
given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or
any part of such books and records as it may elect.

  



  

6.02 _Regulatory Filings_. Subject to _Section 9.03_, Buyer and
Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates and Advisors to,
use reasonable best efforts to (a) make or cause to be made all filings and
submissions to any Governmental Body required under any applicable Laws for
the consummation of the Transactions, (b) coordinate and cooperate with the
Company in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
Company may reasonably request in connection with all of the foregoing, and
(c) (i) supply reasonably promptly any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested in connection with such filings, (ii) make any
further filings with any Governmental Body pursuant thereto that may be
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in connection therewith and (iii)
take all actions necessary to obtain all required clearances. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that this _Section 6.02_ (and not
_Section 6.04_) sets forth Buyer\'s and Merger Sub\'s sole obligations with
respect to regulatory filings, other than filings under the HSR Act, which
are governed solely by _Section 9.03_.

  



  

6.03 _Notification_. Until the Closing, Buyer and Merger Sub
shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware
that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.03 _becoming incapable of being
satisfied.

  



  

   

40

 



    



  

6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement (including the provisions and limitations set forth in _Section
6.02 _and this _Section 6.04_), each of Buyer and Merger Sub will, and will
cause each of their respective Affiliates and Advisors to, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Transactions to be consummated as promptly as
practicable, and no such Person will take any action intended to, or that
would reasonably be expected to, prevent, impede or delay the Closing.
For purposes of this Agreement, the "reasonable best efforts" of Buyer and
Merger Sub will not require either Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Advisors to (a) expend any money to
remedy any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, (b) commence
any litigation or arbitration proceeding, (c) waive or surrender any right to
modify any agreement, (d) offer or grant any accommodation or concession
(financial or otherwise) to any third party, (e) make any payment to third
parties or otherwise suffer any similar detriment or (f) waive or forego any
right, remedy or condition hereunder.

  



  

6.05 _Debt Financing_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting the generality of Buyer\'s and Merger Sub\'s
obligations under _Section 6.04_, Buyer and Merger Sub will use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the
Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement and in timely fashion on the terms and conditions, taken as a
whole, described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in
effect the commitment for the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) negotiating, executing and delivering definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any flex terms in the Debt Commitment
Letter) or on such other terms that would not (A) reduce the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount of the Debt Financing) or (B) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise amend, modify
or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay, or prevent, the
funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, (2) materially impede the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) or (3) materially adversely affect (x) the
ability of Buyer or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto or (y) the ability of Buyer or Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions or (C) be otherwise materially adverse to the interests of the
Company and its Unitholders (any such adverse effect described in clauses (A)
through (C), an  " _Adverse Effect on Financing_ "); (iii) satisfying and
causing to be satisfied (or waived) (and causing their respective Affiliates
to satisfy), on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to Buyer, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements related thereto; and (iv) complying with their
respective obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent failure
to comply with such covenants and other obligations would result in, or
reasonably be expected to result in, an Adverse Effect on Financing.

  



  

   

41

 



    



  

(b) In the event that all conditions to the commitment of any
counterparty to the Debt Commitment Letter providing such Debt
Financing (other than conditions that are within the control of Buyer or
Merger Sub, including conditions relating to (i) the failure of any equity
funding condition of similar effect in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) the
failure to deliver documents by Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates at the Closing, (iii) the failure to pay costs, fees, expenses and
other compensation contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter that are
payable by Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to the
lead arrangers, any lenders and administrative agents or any other Person, or
(iv) a breach, in any material respect, by Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letter) have been satisfied,
Buyer and Merger Sub will, and will cause the Debt Financing Sources to,
consummate the Debt Financing on or prior to the date on which the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.01_ and shall otherwise use
reasonable best efforts to enforce their respective rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter and any definitive documentation entered into in connection
therewith. Buyer and Merger Sub will not, and will cause their respective
Affiliates not to, take or refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any
action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or in any definitive
agreement related to the Debt Financing. Buyer and Merger Sub will not, and
will cause their respective Affiliates not to, object to the utilization of
any "flex" provisions by any Debt Financing Source.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any applicable "flex" terms) contemplated
in the Debt Commitment Letter, or Buyer or Merger Sub becomes aware of any
event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to make any portion
of the Debt Financing unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
any applicable flex terms) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer
and Merger Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources, in a like
amount and on like terms, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event, but, in no event, later than the date Buyer and Merger Sub are
required to consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.01_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such alternative financing will not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, have an Adverse Effect on Financing. For
purposes of this Agreement, references to the " _Debt Financing_ " will
include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted
to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 6.05(c)_ or _Section
6.05(d)_, and references to the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " will include
such documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this
_Section 6.05(c)_ or _Section 6.05(d)_.

  



  

(d) Buyer and Merger Sub will not permit any amendment,
modification or wavier to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Company, except in accordance with
_Section 6.05(c)_; _provided_ that Buyer and Merger Sub may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not result in any Adverse Effect on
Financing. Buyer shall not terminate the Buyer Revolver, and shall keep
available amounts under the Buyer Revolver sufficient, together with cash on
hand and amounts provided under the Debt Commitment Letter, to pay all
amounts required to be paid by Buyer and Merger Sub at the Closing. Prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer will not offer, place or arrange any competing debt
securities or bank financing on behalf of itself or any affiliate with respect
to the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

   

42

 



    



  

(e) Buyer and Merger Sub will keep the Company reasonably informed
promptly upon request by the Company of the status of Buyer\'s and Merger
Sub\'s efforts to obtain the Debt Financing and to satisfy the conditions
thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Merger Sub will notify the
Company promptly if at any time prior to the Closing Date: (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any reason (or if any Person
attempts or purports to terminate or repudiate the Debt Commitment Letter,
whether or not such attempted or purported termination or repudiation is
valid); (ii) Buyer or Merger Sub obtains knowledge of any breach or default
or any threatened breach or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without due notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing of
any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing; (iii) Buyer or Merger Sub receives
any communication (written or oral) from any Person with respect to any (A)
actual, potential or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related
to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing or (B) dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter; (iv)
any Debt Financing Source refuses to provide or expresses (orally or in
writing) an intent to refuse to provide all or any portion of the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set
forth therein (or expresses (orally or in writing) that such Person does not
intend to enter into all or any portion of definitive documentation related to
the Debt Financing or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby);
or (v) there occurs any event or development that could reasonably
be expected to adversely impact the ability of Buyer or Merger Sub to obtain
all, or any portion of, the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing or if at any time for any other reason
Buyer or Merger Sub no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
or the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing.

  



  

6.06 _Director and Officer Liability Tail Insurance_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Company will obtain
irrevocable "tail" insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail Insurance_") covering
the Persons who are presently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect
to directors\' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer and the Surviving Company will not, and will cause their Subsidiaries to
not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect. All costs
associated with the DandO Tail Insurance shall be Transaction Expenses.

  



  

   

43

 



    



  

(b) For a period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date,
Buyer and the Surviving Company will not, and will not permit any of their
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in such Person\'s
certificate of formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or
operating agreement (or equivalent organizational documents), or in any
agreement, relating to the exculpation or indemnification of, or advancement
of expenses to, any current (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) or
former officer, director, employee, manager, managing member, member, partner
(general or limited), fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") in any manner adverse to any such Indemnified Person,
and Buyer and the Surviving Company will cause all such provisions to be
observed by their Subsidiaries, it being the intent of the parties that any
such Indemnified Person will continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law.

  



  

(c) In the event that Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of the respective successors or assigns of the foregoing
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each
case, the successors and assigns of such Persons or properties or assets, as
the case may be, must expressly assume in writing and be bound by the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.06_ as a condition of succession of
assignment.

  



  

(d) This  _Section 6.06_ is intended to be for the benefit of
each of the Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such
Indemnified Person as if such Indemnified Person were a party to this
Agreement. The obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Company under this 
_Section 6.06_ will not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Person to whom this _Section 6.06_ applies without the
consent of such affected Person.

  



  

(e) The Buyer Parties and the Surviving Company, on behalf of
themselves and their Subsidiaries, knowingly, willingly, irrevocably
and expressly acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 6.06_ and the indemnification contemplated by this _Section 6.06_
require performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law and will survive the Closing for six (6) years and will not be
subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of _Section
10.01_.

  



  

6.07 _Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs_. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide the Buyer with a list of all employees
terminated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the ninety (90)
days preceding the Closing, including their date of hire, date of termination
and reason for termination. For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, neither Buyer nor the Surviving Company will, and neither will permit
any of the Surviving Company\'s Subsidiaries to, terminate employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in full compliance with all
requirements of the WARN Act. Buyer and the Surviving Company will, and will
cause the Surviving Company\'s Subsidiaries to, comply with any and
all applicable notice or filing requirements under the WARN Act, and will
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Group from any liabilities, losses,
damages, obligations, costs or expenses, arising as a result of or related to,
in whole or in part, Buyer\'s or the Surviving Company\'s actions or
omissions under the WARN Act occurring on or after the Closing Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification contemplated by this _Section
6.07_ will not subject to any of the survival or other limitation or
exclusive remedy provisions of _Section 10.01_.

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

6.08 _Contact with Business Relations_. Without limiting the
provisions of _Section 5.02 _or _Section 5.03_, Buyer and Merger Sub
acknowledge that they are not authorized to, and agree that they will not, and
they will not permit any member of the Buyer Group to, contact any officer,
director, employee, customer, supplier, distributor, service provider, lessee,
lessor, equityholder, lender, noteholder or other material business relation
of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing with respect to the
Company, its Subsidiaries, their businesses and the Transactions, in each
case, without receiving the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to each
such contact; provided, however, that this Section 6.08 shall not prevent the
Buyer, Merger Sub or any member of the Buyer Group from contacting officers,
directors and employees of the Company regarding post-Closing employment
arrangements or from having contacts in the ordinary course of business not
relating to the Transactions.

  



  

6.09 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All gross receipts, transfer Taxes, gains
Taxes, real property transfer Taxes, sales Taxes, use Taxes, excise
Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes and any other similar Taxes applicable
to, arising out of or imposed upon the Transactions (collectively,  "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") will be timely paid by Buyer. Buyer will prepare any Tax
Returns with respect to such Taxes, at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, and
the Representative will cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and filing of
such Tax Returns.

  



  

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Surviving Company
and the Representative will cooperate reasonably, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other party hereto, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims
with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or the Surviving
Company. As part of such cooperation, the Surviving Company and Buyer shall
timely provide all powers of attorney or other documents or information that
are reasonably necessary for the Representative to control any Representative
Controlled Tax Proceedings or to prepare and file any Representative
Prepared Return. Such cooperation will also include providing records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such matters, making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explaining any materials provided pursuant to this _Section
6.09(b)_ and the provision of certificates or forms and timely execution of
any Tax Returns that are necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption
for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.

  



  

(c) Tax Returns.

  



  

(i) (x) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries due (after taking into
account all appropriate extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date, and (y)
the Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely
file, or cause to be timely filed, any Flow-Through Return of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any IRS Form
1065, or similar forms for state and local Tax purposes, and all related
schedules) for any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (including
any amendments thereto) (whether due on, prior to, or after the Closing Date)
(collectively, the " _Representative Prepared Returns_ "). At least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date of any Representative Prepared Return due
after the Closing Date, the Representative shall provide a draft of such
Representative Prepared Return (including all related schedules) to Buyer for
its review and comment. The Representative shall incorporate any reasonable
comments made by Buyer (provided that such comments are delivered by Buyer no
less than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Representative Prepared
Return) in the final Representative Prepared Return to be filed with the
taxing authority.

  



  

   

45

 



    



  

(ii) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns (other than
the Representative Prepared Returns) of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or
any successor or continuation entity) due after the Closing Date (the "
_Buyer Prepared Returns_ "). To the extent that a Buyer Prepared Return
could reasonably be expected to affect the Taxes of any of the Unitholders,
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such Tax Return shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods, and, to the extent applicable, the conventions and
elections provided for under this Agreement. Except with the consent of
the Representative, the Buyer shall not, and shall not cause (or allow) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to make any election with respect to such
Tax Return that would increase the Taxes payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the amount of Taxes payable by the Unitholders (unless such
election is consistent with past practices consistently applied or is
expressly provided for in this Agreement). If a Buyer Prepared Return could
reasonably be expected to increase the Taxes payable by the Unitholders, Buyer
shall provide a draft of such Buyer Prepared Return (including all related
schedules) to the Representative for its review and comment at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date of any Buyer Prepared Return. Buyer shall
incorporate, or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to incorporate, any
reasonable comments made by the Representative in the first Buyer Prepared
Return filed with the taxing authority (provided that such comments are
delivered to Buyer no less than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such
Buyer Prepared Return).

  



  

(d) The parties hereto agree that the Transaction Tax Deductions
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be included
and taken into account in the Flow-Through Returns of the Company for the
period ending on the Closing Date to the extent "more likely than not"
deductible (or deductible at a higher confidence level) on such Tax Return as
determined by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the
Representative to prepare IRS Form 1065 for the year ending on the Closing
Date. The parties hereto further agree, to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable Law, such Flow-Through Returns shall include an election under
Revenue Procedure 2011-29 (or any available comparable election under state or
local law) with respect to all Transaction Tax Deductions that are success
based fees.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(e) Following the Closing, except with the prior written consent
of the Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned ( _provided_ , it shall not be unreasonable to withhold or
condition consent to the extent the Representative reasonably determines that
the requested action will result in adverse Tax consequences to any Unitholder
(or its direct or indirect owners), will result in any reduction in proceeds
to be paid to any Unitholder under this Agreement, or will result in any
material out of pocket cost to any Unitholder (or its direct or indirect
owner)), Buyer shall not (and shall not cause (or allow) the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or any successor or continuation vehicle of the Company or
any Subsidiary) to): (i) file any Tax Returns of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (other than Buyer Prepared Returns filed in accordance with
_Section 6.09(c)(ii)_) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) amend any Tax
Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including Buyer Prepared Returns) (or file for administrative relief
with respect to any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries filed for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period); (iii) waive or extend the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to a Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; (iv) file any ruling or request that relates to
Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
with any taxing authority; (v) enter into any voluntary disclosure with any
Governmental Body regarding any Tax or Tax Returns of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; (vi) amend or change any
information return provided to any Unitholder with respect to any Tax matter
or (vii) make any Tax election with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries that relates to or is retroactive to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(except to the extent required to file a Buyer Prepared Return as
contemplated by _Section 6.09(c)(ii)_); _provided_ , that such elections or
other actions (described in clauses (i) through (vii) of the sentence) shall
only be restricted pursuant to this _Section 6.09(e)_ to the extent such
elections or other actions could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the Taxes payable by any Unitholder (direct or indirect) (or any owners of
a Unitholder) or, to the extent such act or election is made before the Final
Merger Consideration has been finally determined (or such act or election is
to otherwise be factored into the determination of the Final Merger
Consideration), the amount of Taxes (or the unpaid Taxes) included in the
determination of Net Working Capital or Pre-Closing Income Taxes or
Transaction Expenses. Neither Buyer nor the Surviving Company shall take any
action (other than as requested by the Representative) following the Closing
to replace or appoint a "partnership representative" or "designated
individual" for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.
Neither Buyer nor the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall take any
action on the Closing Date, but after the Closing, that is outside of the
ordinary course of business that will result in an increase in taxable income
shown on the final Flow-Through Return of the Company for the year ending on
the Closing Date or Taxes included in the determination of Net Working
Capital or Pre-Closing Income Taxes.

  



  

(f) Tax Contests.

  



  

(i) Buyer or the Surviving Company, whichever is applicable, shall
provide prompt written notice to the Representative if it receives notice of
any audit, litigation or other proceeding (or claim) involving any Tax, Tax
Return of other Tax matter of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(ii) The Representative shall have the right, subject to the
restrictions and limitations set forth in this _Section 6.09(f)(ii)_, to
control any audit, litigation, or other proceedings relating to the Flow-
Through Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent they relate
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
that Representative elects to control shall be a " _Representative Controlled
Tax Proceeding_ "). In connection with controlling any such Representative
Controlled Tax Proceeding, the Representative shall have the right (i) to,
subject to the Buyer\'s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), name or replace any person designated to act as the
"tax matters partner," "partnership representative" or "designated individual"
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Section __6.09(f)_ , to make, or not to make, and cause
any person acting as "tax matters partner," "partnership representative," or
"designated individual" to make, or not to make, any and all decisions with
respect to any such audit, litigation or other proceedings (including whether
or not to make any permitted elections (including any election under Code
Section 6226, or any similar provision of state or local law) with respect to
any such matters under any applicable provisions of the Code or other
applicable Tax Laws or regulations) and (iii) to settle or otherwise
resolve such audit, litigation or other proceeding it controls; provided, no
such settlement or resolution shall be permitted without the advance written
consent of the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) to the extent it could result in the Company or any
Subsidiary incurring any Tax. The Buyer and the Surviving Company shall take
all actions reasonably requested by the Representative to effect any actions
the Representative wishes to take in accordance with the foregoing sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated elsewhere in this Agreement,
the Buyer, the Unitholders and the Company agree that the election provided
for in Section 6226 of the Code and any similar provision of any state or
local income Tax Law shall be made (and shall cooperate to ensure that such
election is made) with respect to any imputed underpayment determined in
connection with any income Tax audit or other Tax proceeding in respect of
any Flow-Through Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(iii) Buyer and the Surviving Company shall control all audits,
litigation or other proceedings relating to any Tax Returns or Taxes of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any successor or continuation entity)
that are not Representative Controlled Tax Proceedings. If any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding could reasonably be expected to have more than
a de minimis effect on the obligations of any Unitholder for any Taxes, then
Buyer and the Surviving Company (i) shall control such audit, litigation or
other proceeding diligently and in good faith; (ii) shall keep the
Representative reasonably informed as to such audit or proceedings; (iii)
shall not make any election that could have more than a de minimis adverse
effect on the obligations of any Unitholder; and (iv) shall not settle or
resolve such audit or other proceedings (or pay portion thereof) the
settlement of which could have more than a de minimis adverse impact of the
obligations of the Unitholders, without the prior written consent of the
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

(iv) Notwithstanding any provision of the Company\'s limited
liability company agreement (or any operating agreement governing Buyer), the
provisions in this Agreement (including this _Section 6.09(f)_) shall, in
the case of a Pre-Closing Tax Period, control regarding the control of any
audits or other proceedings relating to any Tax matter relating to the Company
(or any continuation or successor to the Company) and the elections and
decisions that the party in control can make or not make (or caused to be made
or not made) in connection with such audit or other proceeding can make.

  



  

   

48

 



    



   



  

(g) _Allocation of Taxes_. If any Tax (other than a Transfer Tax)
relates to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall use the following
conventions for determining the portion of such Tax that relates to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the portion that relates to the Post-Closing Tax
Period: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire period, and the remaining amount
of such Taxes shall be attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period; and (ii)
in the case of all other Taxes, the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined as if a separate return was filed for
the period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a
"closing of the books methodology" and the remaining amount of the Taxes for
such period shall be attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. For
purposes of this _Section 6.09(g)_, (A) any item determined on an annual or
periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions) for
income Tax purposes shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such
portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period; (B) except as provided in clause (C), any Tax or item
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit resulting from a transaction
engaged in by the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing that is
outside of the ordinary course of business shall be allocated to the portion
of the Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date; and (C)
any item of deduction attributable to any Transaction Tax Deductions and
other items incurred by Unitholders shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

  



  

(h) _Tax Treatment_. The Buyer\'s acquisition of the Company
through the Merger is intended to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, in a manner consistent with Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6 such
that the Unitholders shall be treated as selling 100% of their interest in
the Company and the year of the Company shall end on the Closing Date such
that its final IRS Form 1065 of the Company (and other similar Flow-Through
Returns or taxable periods of the Company that end on the Closing Date) shall
be a Representative Prepared Return (such treatment, the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "). For purposes of the Intended Tax Treatment (and the
determination of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule), any PPP Loan (or
deferred revenue) of the Company or its Subsidiaries outstanding as of Closing
shall be treated as a liability (or contingent liability) of the Company and
any Cash or Cash-like items or other assets held in escrow with respect to a
PPP Loan (or otherwise) shall be treated as assets of the Company; _provided_
, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared in a manner that does not result in the Buyer recognizing
any taxable income at the Closing connection with the assumption of any PPP
Loan (or deferred revenue), and no portion of the assets shall be deemed
transferred to the Buyer in consideration of the assumption (as determined for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) of any PPP Loan (or deferred revenue). Each
of the parties to this Agreement agrees not to take any position (on tax
returns or in proceedings) that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment, unless required by applicable Law.

  



  

(i) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

  



  

(i) Within sixty (60) days of the determination of the Final
Adjusted Merger Consideration, Buyer shall provide to the Representative a
schedule allocating the applicable purchase price (taking into account
applicable liabilities for Tax purposes treated as assumed) among all of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule will be prepared in
accordance with the methodologies for determining fair market value of the
various assets of each such entity as set forth on _Exhibit G_ attached
hereto and the applicable provisions of the Code.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(ii) If within the thirty (30) days of receiving the initial
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule from Buyer, the Representative has not
objected, the initial Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as provided by Buyer
to the Representative shall be final and binding. If within thirty (30) days
the Representative objects to the initial Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
provided by Buyer, the Representative and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith
to resolve their differences and to the extent resolved the agreed allocation
schedule shall be final and binding. If after thirty (30) days of trying to
resolve their dispute, the Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, are unable to agree as to a final and binding allocation,
the Representative and Buyer shall retain an independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Representative to resolve their dispute
the agreements (provided the Buyer and Representative agree that the
independent accounting firm shall be bound by the methodologies set forth in
_Exhibit G_ for determining fair market value of the assets and be bound by
the agreed tax treatment as set forth in this _Section 6.09(i)_). Any
determination of the final allocation of the independent accounting firm
shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost of the accounting firm
shall be shared equally by Unitholders, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand. The parties hereto shall make appropriate adjustments to any
final and binding allocation schedule to reflect subsequent changes in the
Final Adjusted Merger Consideration or other applicable items.

  



  

(iii) The parties hereto agree for all Tax reporting purposes to
report the transactions in accordance with the agreements set forth in this 
_Section 6.09_ and the final and binding allocation schedule, as adjusted
from time to time to reflect changes in the Final Adjusted Merger
Consideration or other applicable items, and to not take any position during
the course of any audit or other proceeding inconsistent with such schedule
unless required by a final determination of a taxing authority.

53

 



    



  

9.02 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) _Salary; Wages and Benefits_. Effective as of the Closing and
continuing for one (1) year thereafter, Buyer will, or will cause its
Affiliates, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide all
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing Date, including those on lay-off, medical, disability, family or other
leave of absence, paid or unpaid (the  " _Retained Employees_ ") with base
salaries or hourly wage rates, annual cash bonus opportunities and other
employee benefits (including severance benefits but excluding any equity
compensation or long-term incentive compensation) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (1) those provided to the
Retained Employees immediately prior to the Closing or (2) those provided by
the Buyer and its Affiliates to similarly situated employees of the Buyer and
its Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 9.02(a)_ will obligate Buyer or the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries to continue (and will not prevent
Buyer or the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries from terminating)
the employment of any such Retained Employee.

  



  

(b) _Employee Service Credit and Benefit Plan Participation_.
Buyer (i) will give, or cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to
give, each Retained Employee credit under any benefit plan or personnel
policies that cover the Retained Employee after the Closing Date, including
any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance benefits for
the Retained Employee\'s service with the Company and its Affiliates prior to
the Closing Date to the same extent that such service credit was recognized
under any corresponding Plan prior to the Closing and does not result in a
duplication of benefits, (ii) will use commercially reasonable efforts to
allow such Retained Employees to participate in each group health plan
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates in which any Retained Employees are
eligible to participate (" _Buyer Health Plans_ "), without regard to
preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained
Employee by the corresponding Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and (iii) if any of the Plans that are group health plans are terminated prior
to the end of the plan year that includes the Closing Date, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the Retained Employee with any
expenses that were covered by such terminated Plans for purposes of
determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under any similar
replacement Buyer Health Plan. Buyer will be solely responsible for complying
with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for any individual who is
an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 54.4980B-9 in
connection with the Transactions.

  



  

(c) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. Buyer will cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to credit to each
Retained Employee all vacation and personal holiday pay that the Retained
Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the Closing Date and will
assume all liability for the payment of such amounts.

  



  

(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing set forth in this
_Section 9.02_ will (i) confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or
former employee of the Company, any Retained Employee or upon any other Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
(ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, including any Plan, (iii) guarantee
employment of any employee for any period of time after the Closing Date or

Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee, or (iv) create a
binding employment agreement with any employee.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

9.03 _Antitrust Notification_.

  



  

(a) The Company and the Buyer Parties will, as promptly as
practicable and no later than five (5) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the
United States Department of Justice the notification form required pursuant
to the HSR Act for the Transactions, which form will specifically request
early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act. Each of
the Company and the Buyer Parties will furnish to each other\'s counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act and will provide any supplemental information requested by
any Governmental Body as promptly as practicable. The Company and the Buyer
Parties will use all reasonable best efforts to comply as promptly as
practicable with any requests made for any additional information in
connection with such filings. Buyer will be responsible for all filing fees
payable in connection with such filings.

  



  

(b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Company and
the Buyer Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the
Transactions and to each other apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any
Governmental Body and to comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.
The Buyer Parties will use, and will cause their Affiliates to use, reasonable
best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any other Person so as to
enable the parties to expeditiously close the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.03_ shall require any Buyer
Party to undertake any efforts or to take any action if the taking of such
efforts or action (x) is or would reasonably be expected to result in a loss
by any Buyer Party of a material benefit or material benefits, after
taking into account the adverse effect of the proposed actions on the Buyer
Parties and their Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries), arising from or relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (y) is not conditioned upon the effectiveness of the
Closing.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel
to cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate
and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the
HSR Act at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and
cooperation include counsel\'s undertaking (i) to keep each other
appropriately informed of material communications from and to personnel of
the reviewing Governmental Bodies and (ii) to confer with each other
regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such
Governmental Bodies and the content of any such contacts or presentations.
Neither the Company nor the Buyer Parties will participate in any meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Body with respect of any such filings,
applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting or discussion (which, at the request of either Buyer or the
Company, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). Each party
hereto will have the right to review (subject to appropriate redactions for
confidentiality and attorney-client privilege concerns) and approve the
content of any presentations, white papers or other written materials to be
submitted to any Governmental Body in advance of any such submission.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(d) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, the Buyer
Parties will not take any action, or refrain from taking any action,
the effect of which could reasonably be expected to delay or impede the
ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the forgoing, the Buyer Parties will not, and will not permit
any member of the Buyer Group or their respective Affiliates to, acquire or
agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner),
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would (i) impose
any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any
permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental Body necessary to
consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Body entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions or (iii) delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

9.04 _Certain Consents_. Certain consents to the Transactions may be
required from Governmental Bodies or parties to contracts or other agreements
to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a party (including the
Material Contracts) and that such consents may have not been obtained and may
not be obtained. Neither the Company nor any of the Seller Group will have
any liability whatsoever to Buyer or Merger Sub (and Buyer and Merger Sub
will not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in
connection with the Transactions (other than the HSR Act and the Necessary
Unitholder Approval) or because of the default, acceleration or termination
of or loss of right under any such contract or other agreement as a result
thereof. Further, no failure to obtain any such consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination or loss of right or any action commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such consent or any such default, acceleration or
termination or loss of right shall result in the failure of any condition set
forth in _Article VII_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 9.04 _shall be deemed to impair or otherwise limit the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.03_.

  



  

9.05 _Written Consents_. Promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the

constituting the Necessary Unitholder Approval, evidencing the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Transactions.

  



  

9.06 _Pride Utility Escrow_. Promptly, but no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Company EBITDA Statement (as defined in the Pride
Utility Purchase Agreement) is finalized in accordance with Section 2.10 of
the Pride Utility Purchase Agreement, the Representative and the Surviving
Company shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions to
release from the Pride Utility Escrow Account (x) to the Seller (as defined
in the Pride Utility Purchase Agreement) any amounts payable to the Seller
(as defined in the Pride Utility Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 2.10

10.01 _Survival; Certain Waivers_.

  



  

(a) Each of the representations and warranties and the covenants
and agreements (to the extent such covenant or agreement contemplates
or requires performance by such party prior to the Closing) of the parties
set forth in this Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby, or in
any certificate delivered hereunder or thereunder, will terminate effective
immediately as of the Closing (and there shall be no liability after the
Closing in respect thereof). Each covenant and agreement requiring performance
at or after the Closing, will, in each case, expressly survive Closing in
accordance with its terms, and if no term is specified, then for twenty (20)
years following the Effective Time, and nothing in this _Section 10.01(a)_
will be deemed to limit any rights or remedies of any Person for breach of
any such surviving covenant or agreement (with it being understood that Buyer
and Merger Sub will also be liable for breach of any covenant or agreement
requiring performance by the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing), and that nothing herein will limit or affect
Buyer\'s or Merger Sub\'s or any of their respective Affiliates\' liability
for the failure to pay the Merger Consideration (in whole or in part) or pay
any other amounts payable by them (in whole or in part) as and when required
by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (including under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and any
other Environmental Law), the Company and the Buyer Parties knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree, on their own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that any and all rights, claims and
causes of action any of them may have against any member of the Seller Group
relating to the operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or
any other document contemplated hereby, or the Transactions, in each case,
whether or not arising under, or based upon, any Law (including any right,
whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution,
cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy) are hereby
irrevocably waived (other than, and solely with respect to any of the
covenants in this Agreement that survive the Closing), except for claims (a)
based on Fraud, (b) based on the breach of any covenants contained in
___Article IX _applicable to the Seller Group that expressly survive the
Closing, (c) in relation to the Merger Consideration adjustment set out in
_Section 1.07_, or (d) with respect to the obligations set forth in _Section
6.09 _(collectively, the  " _Waiver Exceptions_ "). Furthermore, except with
respect to the Waiver Exceptions, from and after the Effective Time, without
limiting the generality of this _Section 10.01_, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (including under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and any
other Environmental Law), no action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding
will be brought, encouraged, supported or maintained by, or on behalf of, any
member of the Buyer Group (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries) against any member of the Seller Group, and no
recourse will be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or
based upon, any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any
of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or
any other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement or any
other document contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument, agreement
or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with the Transactions
(other than, and solely with respect to, any of the covenants that survive the
Closing in accordance with _Section 10.01(a)_), the subject matter of this
Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby, the Transactions, the
business, the ownership, operation, management, use or control of the business
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or any
actions or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing or the Effective
Time. Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this _Section 10.01_,
from and after the Closing, the Buyer Parties will not be entitled to rescind
this Agreement or, subject to _Section 8.01_, treat this Agreement as
terminated by reason of any breach of this Agreement, and the Buyer Parties
knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly waive any and all rights of
rescission it may have in respect of any such matter, except with respect to
the Waiver Exceptions.

Buyer Group, that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.01_ (i)
require performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law and will survive the Closing for twenty (20) years and will not
be subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of this
_Section 10.01_ and (ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and
that, without the agreements set forth in this _Section 10.01_, the Company

to the Unitholders. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.01_ shall
not limit any party\'s rights to pursue claims based on Fraud.

  



  

10.02 _Acknowledgment by the Buyer Parties_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer Parties (on their own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group) knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and
agree that: (a) they have conducted to their full satisfaction their own
independent investigation and verification of the business, financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and
prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and has been afforded
satisfactory access to the books and records, facilities and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting such investigation and
verification, (b) the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
the Company made to the Buyer Parties in connection with the Transactions, (c)
except for the representations and warranties expressly given in this
Agreement, none of the Company, the Seller Group or any other Person makes, or
has made, any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Transactions, and all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature express or implied
(including (i) regarding the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to
state or to disclose, any information, including in the
estimates, projections or forecasts or any other information, document or
material provided to or made available to the Buyer Parties in certain "data
rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
Transactions, including meetings, calls or correspondence with management of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or any member of the Seller Group, and (ii)
any relating to the future or historical business, condition (financial or
otherwise), results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or condition of the
Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' assets) are specifically disclaimed by the
Seller Group, the Company and its Subsidiaries and all other Persons
(including the Advisors of the Company or its Subsidiaries) and (d) they have
not relied and are not relying on any representations and warranties in
connection with the Transactions except the representations and warranties
expressly given in this Agreement. In connection with the Buyer Parties\'
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Buyer Parties have
received certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certain business plan information. The Buyer Parties (on their own behalf and
on behalf of the Buyer Group) knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly
acknowledge and agree that that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that the Buyer Parties are familiar with such uncertainties and that the
Buyer Parties are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans so furnished to them, including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Without
limiting the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Buyer Parties (on
their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group) knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree that none of the
Seller Group, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
current or former Affiliates or Advisors is making any representation or
warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and forecasts, and that the Buyer Parties have
not relied on any such estimates, projections or other forecasts or plans.
The Buyer Parties (on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group)
knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree that
from and after the Closing none of the Seller Group, the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any other Person shall have or be subject to any
liability to the Buyer Parties or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to them, or the Buyer Parties\' use of, any such estimates,
projections or forecasts or any other information, document or material
provided to or made available to the Buyer Parties in certain "data
rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer
Parties, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, hereby
knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waive, any warranty or representation
(whether in written, electronic or oral form), express or implied, as to the
quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or condition of
the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' business, operations, assets,
liabilities, prospects or any portion thereof, except solely to the extent
expressly set forth in this Agreement, in each case, as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules and the terms and conditions of, including the
limitations and exclusions in, this Agreement.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(b) The Buyer Parties (on their own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group) knowingly, willingly, irrevocable and expressly acknowledge and
agree that they will not assert, institute or maintain any action, suit,
claim, investigation or proceeding of any kind whatsoever, including a
counterclaim, cross-claim or defense, regardless of the legal or equitable
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
that makes any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set forth in
_Section 10.01_ or this _Section 10.02_.

  



  

(c) The Buyer Parties (on their own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group) knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and
agree that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.02_ (i) require
performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law and will survive the Closing for twenty (20) years and will not be subject
to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of _Section 10.01_ and
(ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements set forth in this _Section 10.02_, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement or recommend approval of this Agreement to the
Unitholders.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
nothing shall limit any remedy of the Buyer Group in the event of Fraud.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

10.03 _Provision Respecting Representation of Company_. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its directors, members, equityholders, partners, managers, members, officers,
employees and Affiliates, (a) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (the " _Retained
Counsel_ ") has been retained by, and may serve as counsel to, each and any
of the Representative and the Unitholders, on the one hand, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the Transactions, (b) that the Retained Counsel has not acted
as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the Transactions and
that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a client of the
Retained Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result
thereof, and (c) that, following consummation of the Transactions, the
Retained Counsel (or any of their respective successors) may serve as counsel
to the Unitholders or any director, member, partner, manager, officer,
employee or Affiliate of any Unitholder, in connection with any
litigation, action, suit, claim, investigation, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Surviving Company, Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the parties
hereto (on their own behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates) hereby consents
thereto and knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties will cause any Affiliate
thereof to consent to knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waive any conflict
of interest arising from such representation. Buyer, the Surviving Company
and the Unitholders hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between Buyer, the Surviving Company, or its
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Unitholders or their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, the Retained Counsel may represent the
Unitholders, or such Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of
the Unitholders or such Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer, the
Surviving Company, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though the
Retained Counsel may have represented the Surviving Company, the Company or
its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Surviving Company, the Company or any
of their Subsidiaries. In addition, Buyer agrees that (x) all communications
among any Unitholder, the Company and its Subsidiaries, any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or Advisors, and the
Retained Counsel that relate in any way with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute arising in
connection with, this Agreement, or otherwise relating to any potential sale
of the Company or the Transactions (the " _Protected Seller Communications_
"), will be deemed to be privileged and confidential communications, (y) all
rights to such Protected Seller Communications, the expectation of client
confidentiality, and the control of the confidentiality and privilege
applicable thereto, belong to and will be retained by the Unitholders and (z)
to the extent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing) should discover in its possession after
the Closing any Protected Seller Communications, it will take reasonable
steps to preserve the confidentiality thereof and promptly deliver the same to
the Representative, keeping no copies, and will not by reason thereof assert
any loss of confidentiality or privilege protection. As to any such Protected
Seller Communications prior to the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company, and each
of its Subsidiaries together with any of their respective affiliates,
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that none of the foregoing
may use or rely on any of the Protected Seller Communications in any action
against or involving any of the Unitholders, the Retained Counsel after the
Closing. The Protected Seller Communications may be used by the Unitholders or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute that
relates in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Buyer Parties
knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree, on
their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that the agreements
contained in this _Section 10.03_ (i) require performance after the Closing
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will survive the
Closing for twenty (20) years and will not be subject to any of the
survival or exclusive remedy provisions of _Section 10.01_; and (ii) are an
integral part of the Transactions and that, without the agreements set forth
in this _Section 10.03_, the Company would not enter into this Agreement
or recommend approval of this Agreement to the Unitholders.

10.04 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the Transactions (including any
press release or other public announcement disclosing the transaction
consideration (or any other amounts related thereto)) will be issued or made
by any party to this Agreement or any of its Affiliates or Advisors without
the joint approval of Buyer and the Representative, unless required by Law or
the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange, in which
case Buyer and the Representative, as applicable, will have the right to
review and comment on such press release or announcement prior to
publication; _provided_ that each Unitholder will be entitled to communicate
regarding the Transaction with its and its Affiliates\' investors and
proposed investors who are obligated to keep such information confidential.

  



  

10.05 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing takes place, except as
expressly provided herein, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in

10.07 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned (
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may collaterally assign this Agreement to
any of the Debt Financing Sources (or any agent therefor) as collateral
security, which assignment shall not in any way effect the obligations of
Buyer under this Agreement) or delegated without the prior written consent of
(a) prior to the Closing, the Representative and Buyer and (b) from and after
the Closing, the Surviving Company and the Representative.

  



  

10.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. Except as provided herein, any provision
of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be
amended or waived (a) only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company, the
Representative and, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub; and (b) subject
to _Section 7.04_, with respect to the waiver of conditions to Closing as
of the Effective Time, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be
effective against Buyer, the Company, the Representative or, prior to the
Closing, Merger Sub, only as set forth in a writing executed by such Person.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof will
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
this _Section 10.08_, _Section 10.09_, _Section 10.18_, and _Section
10.22_ (and, in each case, any related defined terms or provisions of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing sections) may not
be modified, waived or terminated in a manner materially adverse to the Debt
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources that have consent rights over amendments to this Agreement
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

10.09 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as otherwise expressly
provided herein, including _Section 5.03(c)_ and  _Section 6.06_, and, as
relates to the Debt Financing Sources, as expressly set forth in, _Section
10.08_, this _Section 10.09_, _Section 10.18_ and _Section 10.22_, (ii)
for the rights of the members of the Seller Group under _Section 10.01(b)_
and _10.02_ and (ii) for the rights of the Retained Counsel under _Section
10.03_, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing
Sources are express and intended third part beneficiaries of _Section
10.08_, this _Section 10.09_, _Section 10.18_ and _Section 10.22_ and
may enforce the terms of those provisions directly against parties hereto.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with this Agreement

10.10 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement may only be brought against, the

extent named as a party to this Agreement, and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations of such parties set forth in this Agreement, no past,
present or future shareholder, member, partner, manager, director, officer,
employee, Affiliate, agent or Advisor of any party to this Agreement or any
Subsidiary of Company will have any liability (whether in contract,
tort, equity or otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties,

parties to this Agreement or for any action, suit, claim, investigation, or
proceeding based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement.

  



  

10.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will
be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

10.12 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any
Person. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and will in no way restrict or
otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

  



  

10.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience in separately numbered
sections corresponding to the sections of this Agreement; however, each
section of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to incorporate by
reference all information disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure
Schedules to the extent the relevance of such information to such other
section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent. Capitalized terms
used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar
amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or the
attached exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact of the setting of
the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules or exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not set forth or included
in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits is or is not required
to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be
disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary
course of business. In addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement
to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. No information set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules will be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the parties\'
representations and warranties. Any description of any agreement, document,
instrument, plan, arrangement or other item set forth on any Disclosure
Schedule is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of
such agreement, document, instrument, plan, arrangement or item. The
information contained in this Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules and
exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by
any party hereto to any Person of any matter whatsoever, including any
violation of Law or breach of contract.

10.14 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Paying Agent
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements expressly referred to
herein or therein (collectively, " _Transaction Documents_ "), contain the
entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement
and the Transactions and supersedes all prior agreements among the parties
respecting the sale and purchase of the Company. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises with respect to this Agreement,
the terms and provisions of the execution version of this Agreement will
control and prior drafts of this Agreement and the documents referenced herein
will not be considered or analyzed for any purpose (including in support of
parol evidence proffered by any Person in connection with this Agreement),
will be deemed not to provide any evidence as to the meaning of the
provisions hereof or the intent of the parties with respect hereto and will
be deemed joint work product of the parties.

  



  

10.15 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties
hereto agree and acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of
this Agreement are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term,
condition or provision of any other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated by this Agreement, this Agreement will govern and control.

  



  

10.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary relief, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly
agreed that (a) the parties hereto will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section 10.17 _without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
such party is entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the right of specific
performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Buyer would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert
that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that
the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party pursuing an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 10.16 _will
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such Order. The remedies available to the Company pursuant to this _Section
10.16_ will be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law
or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific
performance will not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from
seeking to collect or collecting damages related to the breach of this
Agreement; provided that the parties will not be entitled to a grant of both
specific performance and money damages. If, prior to the End Date, any party
hereto brings any action, in each case in accordance with _Section
10.17_, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the End Date will automatically be extended (y)
for the period during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business
Days or (z) by such other time period established by the court presiding over
such action, as the case may be.

of the Class A Common Unitholders and Class B Unitholders for certain limited
purposes, as specified herein. Approval of this Agreement by a majority of
the Members (as defined in the Company\'s limited liability company
agreement) will, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law,
constitute knowing and irrevocable ratification and approval of such
designation by the majority Unitholders, and authorization of the
Representative to serve in such capacity (including the exclusive power to
negotiate and settle any and all disputes with Buyer or Merger Sub under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement), and will also
constitute a reaffirmation, approval, consent to, acceptance and adoption of,
and an agreement to comply with and perform, all of the acknowledgments,
waivers, releases, covenants and agreements made by the Representative on
behalf of the Class A Common Unitholders and Class B Unitholders in this
Agreement and the other documents delivered in connection herewith (including
the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement), in each case, whether
entered into or taken before, on or after the date of such approval. The
Representative may resign at any time and may be removed only by the vote of
Persons that collectively owned more than 50% of the Class A Common Units and
Class B Units as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, voting as a
single class (other than the Class A Common Units and Class B Units cancelled
pursuant to _Section 1.04(d)_) (such Persons, the " _Majority Holders_ ").
The designation of the Representative is coupled with an interest, and,
except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the
resignation or removal of the Representative, such designation is irrevocable
and will not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness,
bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to act of any of the Class A
Common Unitholders or Class B Unitholders. In the event that a Representative

Agreement and in any other document delivered in connection herewith

of the Class A Common Unitholders or Class B Unitholders. The Company, the
Surviving Company, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent and
the Firm will be entitled to rely on the actions taken by the Representative
without independent inquiry into the capacity of the Representative to so

been authorized by, and will be binding upon, the Class A Common Unitholders
and Class B Unitholders. Neither the Representative, nor any of its officers,

Advisors will have any liability to Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the

or any of their respective Affiliates, or any Person acting on behalf of the
foregoing, with respect to actions taken, or omitted to be taken, by the
Representative in such capacity (or its officers, directors, employees,
partners (general or limited), members, managers, or Advisors in connection
therewith), except the Representative will be liable for its actual fraud as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no further
appeal may be taken. The Representative will be entitled to engage such
Advisors as it will deem necessary in connection with exercising its
powers and performing its functions hereunder and (in the absence of bad
faith on the part of the Representative) will be entitled to conclusively
rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons in all matters. The
Representative (for itself, and for its officers, directors, employees,
partners (general or limited), members, managers, Advisors) will be entitled
to full reimbursement for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its Advisors) incurred by or on behalf
of the Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers, directors,
employees, partners (general or limited), members, managers, or Advisors in
connection therewith), and to full indemnification against any liabilities,
losses, damages, obligations, costs or expenses arising out of actions taken
or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Representative (except for those
arising out of the Representative\'s actual fraud as finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction from which no further appeal may be taken),
including the costs and expenses of investigation, defense, settlement or
adjudication of any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding, from
the Class A Common Unitholders and Class B Unitholders (including from funds
paid to the Representative under this Agreement or otherwise received by it
in its capacity as the Representative, or funds to be distributed to the Class
A Common Unitholders or Class B Unitholders under this Agreement at its
direction, pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement (including under
the Escrow Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement)) and all payments required to
be made under _ARTICLE I_ are expressly subject to this _Section 10.19(b)_.
Each Class A Common Unitholder and Class B Unitholder will be responsible for
its pro rata portion of any amount owed to the Representative in accordance
with this _Section 10.19(b)_ based upon the number of Class A Common Units
or Class B Units held by such Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder
immediately prior to the Closing as a proportion of the Aggregate Fully-
Diluted Units (as finally calculated by _Section 1.07(e)_). In furtherance
of the foregoing, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Representative will have the power and authority to set aside and retain
additional funds paid to or received by it, or direct payment of additional
funds to be paid to the Class A Common Unitholders or Class B Unitholders as
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement at Closing or thereafter
(including to establish such reserves as the Representative determines in
good faith to be appropriate for such costs and expenses that are not then
known or determinable). The relationship created herein is not to be
construed as a joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the
Representative or any Class A Common Unitholder or Class B Unitholder for any
purpose of U.S. federal or state Law, including federal, state or foreign
income Tax purposes. Neither the Representative nor any of its
Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to any Class A Common Unitholder
or Class B Unitholder.

hereunder, and no action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding will be
brought by, or on behalf of, any Buyer Party or the Buyer Group (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) against
the Representative with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, or any
statement, certificate, instruction, opinion, instrument or other documents
delivered hereunder (with it being understood that any covenant or agreement
of or by the "parties" or "each of the parties" will not be deemed to require
performance by, or be an agreement of, the Representative unless performance
by the Representative is expressly provided for in such covenant or the
Representative expressly so agrees in writing).

  



  

10.20 _No Right of Set-Off_. Each Buyer Party, on its own behalf
and on behalf of the Buyer Group, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment or similar
rights that any member of the Buyer Group has or may have with respect to the
payment of the Merger Consideration or any other payments to be made by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or instrument delivered by
Buyer in connection herewith.

  



  

10.21 _Counterparts_. This Agreement, and any other agreements
referred to herein or therein, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be
executed in multiple counterparts, any one of which need not contain the
signature of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same instrument. Any counterpart, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine, .pdf or other
electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original contract and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered
in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each
other party hereto or thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and
deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract
will raise the use of a facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic
transmission to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile
machine, .pdf or other electronic transmission as a defense to the formation
of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

the neutral gender. Where a word is defined herein, references to
