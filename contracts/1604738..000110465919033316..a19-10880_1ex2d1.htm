Capital Statement (other than the Non-Current Stock Plan Liability and
Estimated Pro Rated Incentive Fees) was prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and
procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and
estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Audited 2018
Carve-Out Financial Statements (in the case Remington and its consolidated
subsidiaries) and the Audited 2018 Marietta Financial Statements (in the case
of Marietta Leasehold LP) as if such Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement were being prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end, and (y) the
estimate of the Non-Current Stock Plan Liability was calculated applying the
same methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that
were used to calculate the Non-Current Stock Plan Liability set forth in
_Schedule 3.06(a)_ but with a determination date as of the Closing Date.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) If the Closing Adjustment is a positive number, New Holdco will pay to
the Remington WC Parties in cash an amount equal to the Closing Adjustment at
the Closing. Subject to _Section 11.01_, if the Closing Adjustment is a

amount equal to the Closing Adjustment at the Closing.

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, New Holdco will prepare and deliver
to the Remington WC Parties a statement setting forth its calculation of
Closing Working Capital, which statement will contain a balance sheet of the
Remington Companies (other than Marietta Leasehold LP) on a consolidated basis
as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to any of the Transactions), a
balance sheet of Marietta Leasehold LP on a consolidated basis as of the
Closing Date (without giving effect to any of the Transactions), the Non-
Current Stock Plan Liability as of the Closing Date, the Closing Working
Capital Statement and a certificate of the senior accounting officer of New
Holdco that (x) the Closing Working Capital Statement (other than the Non-
Current Stock Plan Liability and Estimated Pro Rated Incentive Fees) was
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods,
practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that
were used in the preparation of the Audited 2018 Carve-Out Financial
Statements (in the case Remington and its consolidated subsidiaries) and the
Audited 2018 Marietta Financial Statements (in the case of Marietta Leasehold
LP) as if such Closing Working Capital Statement were being prepared and
audited as of a fiscal year end, and (y) the Non-Current Stock Plan Liability
was calculated applying the same methods, practices, principles, policies and
procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and
estimation methodologies that were used to calculate the Non-Current Stock
Plan Liability set forth in _Schedule 3.06(a)_ but with a determination date
as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Estimated Pro Rated
Incentive Fees and Estimated Pro Rated Bonus Liabilities for this purpose
shall be the same as the Estimated Pro Rated Incentive Fees and Estimated Pro
Rated Bonus Liabilities, respectively, provided pursuant to _Section
2.06(a)_.

(c) _Examination and Review_.

 



 

(i) After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Remington WC
Parties will have the Review Period to review the Closing Working Capital
Statement. During the Review Period, the Remington WC Parties and the
Bennetts Accountants will have full access to the books and records of
Remington and Marietta Leasehold LP, the personnel of, and work papers
prepared by, New Holdco (or

 



     

 

 



 

its Affiliates) and New Holdcos Accountants to the extent that they relate to
the Closing Working Capital Statement and to such historical financial
information (to the extent in the possession of New Holdco or its Affiliates)
relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as the Remington WC Parties
may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Working
Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections, provided, that
such access will be in a manner that does not interfere with the normal
business operations of New Holdco or the Remington Companies.

 



 

(ii) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Remington WC
Parties may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to
New Holdco a Statement of Objections. If the Remington WC Parties fail to
deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment,
as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement will be
deemed to have been accepted by the Remington WC Parties. If the Remington WC
Parties deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the
Review Period, New Holdco and the Remington WC Parties will negotiate in good
faith to resolve such objections within the Resolution Period, and, if the
same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment
and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been
previously agreed in writing by New Holdco and the Remington WC Parties, will
be final and binding.

 



 

(iii) If the Remington WC Parties and New Holdco fail to reach an agreement
with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections
before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any Disputed Amounts will be
submitted for resolution to the office of the Independent Accountant who,
acting as experts and not arbitrators, will resolve the Disputed Amounts only
and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be,
and the Closing Working Capital Statement. The Parties agree that all
adjustments will be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountant will only decide the specific items under dispute by the Parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively.

 



 

(iv) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be paid by the
Remington WC Parties, on the one hand, and by New Holdco, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded
to the Remington WC Parties or New Holdco, respectively, bears to the
aggregate amount actually contested by the Remington WC Parties and New
Holdco.

 



 

(v) The Independent Accountant will make a determination as soon as
practicable within 30 days (or such other time as the Parties agree in
writing) after their engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts
and their adjustments to the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-
Closing Adjustment will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

 



     

 

 



 

(vi) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any payment of the Post-
Closing Adjustment, together with interest calculated as set forth below, will
(1) be due (x) within five Business Days of acceptance of the applicable
Closing Working Capital Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then
within five Business Days of the resolution described in _Section
2.06(c)(v)_; and (2) be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account as is directed by New Holdco or the Remington WC Parties, as
the case may be. The amount of any Post-Closing Adjustment will bear interest
from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a
rate per annum equal to 4.0%. Such interest will be calculated daily on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

 



 

(d) _Incentive Fees and Bonus Liabilities_.

 



 

(i) Remington shall calculate, collect, disburse and pay, as applicable, the
Incentive Fees and Bonus Liabilities consistent in all material respects with
past practices and the terms of the applicable hotel management agreements,
employee agreements and other related agreements. Remington shall provide the
Remington Parties full access to the books and records and personnel of
Remington to the extent that they relate to the calculation and determination
of the Incentive Fees or the Bonus Liabilities.

 



 

(ii) Within five Business Days after the later of (x) the determination of the
Incentive Fees for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs and (y) the
determination of the Bonus Liabilities for the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs, Remington shall deliver to the Remington WC Parties a
statement setting forth its calculation of the Pro Rated Incentive Fees and
the Pro Rated Bonus Liabilities (the " _Fee/Bonus Statement_ "). The Remington
WC Parties may object to the Fee/Bonus Statement by delivering to New Holdco a
statement of objection within 20 days of their receipt of the Fee/Bonus
Statement. If the Remington WC Parties fail to deliver such a statement of
objection before the expiration of such 20-day period, the Fee/Bonus Statement
will be deemed to have been accepted by the Remington WC Parties, and the Pro
Rated Incentive Fees and Pro Rated Bonus Liabilities thereon shall be final.
If the Remington WC Parties deliver a statement objecting to such Fee/Bonus
Statement before the expiration of such 20-day period, New Holdco and the
Remington WC Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections,
and the Pro Rated Incentive Fees and Pro Rated Bonus Liabilities shall be the
amounts finally agreed to in writing by New Holdco and the Remington WC
Parties.

 



 

(iii) If the Post-Closing Fee/Bonus Adjustment is a positive number, New
Holdco will promptly pay to the Remington WC Parties in cash an amount equal
to the Post-Closing Fee/Bonus Adjustment. Subject to _Section 11.01_, if the
Post-Closing Fee/Bonus Adjustment is a negative number, the Remington WC
Parties will promptly pay to New Holdco in cash an amount equal to the Post-
Closing Fee/Bonus Adjustment.

 **Section 3.09** ** Management Contracts.**

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.09(a)_ lists each Management Contract. Each of the Management
Contracts is valid and in full force and effect and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the counterparties thereto)
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the applicable Remington
Company and is enforceable against each such Remington Company in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). None of the
Remington Companies is in breach of or default under any of the Management
Contracts in any material respect, nor has any Remington Company received any
notice of any such breach or default and, to the Bennetts Knowledge, no
condition or event or fact exists which, with notice, lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a breach of or default under any Management Contract in any
material respect on the part of any of the Remington Companies or result in a
termination thereof or permit other changes of any material right or
obligation or loss of any material benefit thereunder.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.09(b)_ , there are no outstanding
loans, lines of credit, guarantees or cash advances of any Remington Company
to any

 



     

 

 



 

counterparty to any Management Contract or any management fees due and payable
to any Remington Company pursuant to any Management Contract that have not
been fully paid and satisfied.

 



 

(c) All material expenses allocated to the counterparties to the Management
Contracts or loans or advances of funds to such counterparties by the
Remington Companies are authorized by and in compliance with the Management
Contracts and applicable Laws.

 



 

(d) No Remington Company has any liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever, asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, absolute or contingent,
accrued or unaccrued, matured or unmatured or otherwise under any Management
Contract to any Person other than the Person for which it is acting as agent
under such Management Contract. No Remington Company is in breach of or has
defaulted under any Management Contract in any material respect with respect
to its obligations to its principal under any such Management Contract.

 



 

 **Section 3.10** ** Material Contracts**.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.10(a)_ lists each of the following Contracts (other than
Management Contracts) to which any of the Remington Companies is a party as
principal and not as agent or otherwise bound (such Contracts being "
_Material Contracts_ "):

 



 

(i) each Contract involving aggregate consideration from any Remington Company
in excess of $250,000 and that, in each case, cannot be cancelled by the
respective Remington Company without penalty or without more than 90 days
notice;

 



 

(ii) each Contract under which any Remington Company received revenue of more
than $250,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to the Hotel
Management Business or under which the Remington Company expects to receive
revenue of more than $250,000 with respect to the Hotel Management Business in
any future fiscal year;

 



 

(iii) all Contracts that require any Remington Company to purchase its total
requirements of any product or service from a third party or that contain
"take or pay" provisions;

 



 

(iv) all Contracts that provide for the indemnification by any Remington
Company of any Person or the assumption by any Remington Company of any Tax,
environmental or other Liability of any Person;

 



 

(v) all Contracts that relate to the acquisition or disposition of any
business, a material amount of equity or assets of any other Person or any
real property (whether by merger, sale of stock or other equity interests,
sale of assets or otherwise);

 



     

 

 



 

(vi) all broker, distributor, dealer, representative, franchise, agency, sales
promotion, market research, marketing consulting and advertising Contracts
under which any Remington Company expects to pay at least $250,000 per year
with respect to the Hotel Management Business;

 



 

(vii) all employment agreements and Contracts with independent contractors or
consultants (or similar arrangements) to which any Remington Company is a
party which are not cancellable without material penalty or without more than
90 days notice;

 



 

(viii) except for Contracts relating to trade payables in the ordinary course
of business, all Contracts relating to indebtedness (including guarantees) of
any Remington Company;

 



 

(ix) all Contracts with any Governmental Authority, other than specifically

Party, other than any Organizational Documents of any Remington Company;

 



 

(xiii) all collective bargaining agreements or Contracts with any Union to
which any Remington Company is a party; and

 



 

(xiv) any other Contract that is material to the Remington Companies, taken as
a whole, and not otherwise disclosed pursuant to this _Section 3.10_.

 



 

(b) Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the respective Remington
Company, and, to the Knowledge of the Bennetts, the other parties thereto, in
accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect. None of the
Remington Companies or, to the Bennetts Knowledge, any other party thereto is
in breach of or default under (or is alleged to be in breach of or default
under) in any material respect, or has provided or received any written notice
of any intention to terminate, any Material Contract. To the Bennetts
Knowledge, no event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute an event of default under any Material Contract
or result in a termination thereof or would cause or permit the acceleration
or other changes of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit
thereunder. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any
termination, cancellation or acceleration right, discount, charge or penalty
or any other rights or obligations arising thereunder from a change of control
or similar event of any Remington Company. Complete and correct copies of each
Material Contract

 



     

 

 



 

(including all written modifications, amendments and supplements thereto and
waivers thereunder and, in the case of oral Contracts, summaries of all
material terms thereof) have been made available to AINC.

 



 

 **Section 3.11** ** Title to Assets; No Real Property**.

 



 

(a) As of the Closing, the Remington Companies will have good and valid title
to all personal property reflected in the Interim Balance Sheet and the
Marietta Interim Balance Sheet, other than property sold or otherwise disposed
of in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the
Balance Sheet Date. All such personal property is free and clear of
Encumbrances, except for the following (collectively referred to as "
_Permitted Encumbrances_ "):

 



 

(i) those items set forth in _Schedule 3.11(a)_ ;

 



 

(ii) liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or liens for Taxes being
contested in good faith by appropriate procedures for which appropriate
reserves are reflected on the Interim Financial Statements or the Marietta
Interim Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP;

 



 

(iii) mechanics, carriers, workmens, repairmens or other like liens arising
or incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
or amounts that are not delinquent and which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the business of the Remington Companies; or

 



 

(iv) liens arising under original purchase price conditional sales contracts
and equipment leases with third parties entered into in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the business of the Remington Companies.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.11(b)_ , none of the Remington
Companies own, lease, sublease or otherwise have any ownership, lease or
sublease interests in any real property.

 



 

 **Section 3.12** ** Condition and Sufficiency of Assets**. The buildings,
structures, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and other
items of tangible property owned or leased by the Remington Companies,
together with all other properties and assets of the Remington Companies, if
any, constitute all of the rights, property and assets necessary to conduct
the Hotel Management Business in all material respects as currently conducted.

 



 

 **Section 3.13** ** Intellectual Property**.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.13_ lists all: (i) Remington IP Registrations; and (ii)
Remington Intellectual Property, including software, that are not registered
but that are material to the Remington Companies business, other than shrink-
wrap, click-wrap or similar commercially available off-the-shelf software
licenses. All required filings and

 



     

 

 



 

fees related to the Remington IP Registrations have been timely filed with and
paid to the relevant Governmental Authorities and authorized registrars, and
all Remington IP Registrations are otherwise in good standing.

 



 

(b) The Bennetts have made available to AINC true and complete copies of all
material Remington IP Agreements, including all modifications, amendments and
supplements thereto and waivers thereunder. Each such material Remington IP
Agreement is valid and binding on the respective Remington Company in
accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect. None of the
Remington Companies or any other party thereto is in breach of or default
under (or is alleged to be in breach of or default under), or has provided or
received any notice of breach or default of or any intention to terminate, any
such material Remington IP Agreement.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.13(c)_ , the Remington Companies are
the owner of (in the case of owned Remington Intellectual Property) and have
the valid right to use all other Remington Intellectual Property used in the
conduct of the Remington Companies business, in each case, free and clear of
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Remington Companies are
the record owner and have the valid right to use the Remington IP
Registrations.

 



 

(d) There are no Actions (including any oppositions, interferences or re-
examinations) settled, pending or threatened (including in the form of offers
to obtain a license): (i) alleging any infringement, misappropriation,
dilution or violation of the Intellectual Property of any Person by the
Remington Companies in connection with the Hotel Management Business; or (ii)
challenging the validity, enforceability, registrability or ownership of any
Remington Intellectual Property or the Remington Companies rights with
respect to any Remington Intellectual Property. The Remington Companies are
not subject to any outstanding or prospective Governmental Order (including
any motion or petition therefor) that does or would restrict or impair the use
of any Remington Intellectual Property. Except as would not have a Remington
Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the Bennetts: (i) the Remington
Intellectual Property as currently licensed or used by the Remington
Companies, and the Remington Companies conduct of the Hotel Management
Business as currently conducted, do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
violate the Intellectual Property of any Person; and (ii) no Person is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Remington Intellectual
Property. This _Section 3.13(d)_ constitutes the sole representation and
warranty of the Bennetts and the Remington Companies under this Agreement with
respect to any actual or alleged infringement, misappropriation or other
violation by the Remington Companies or the Hotel Management Business of the
Intellectual Property of any other Person.

 



 

(e) The consummation of the Transactions will not result in the loss or
impairment of or payment of any additional amounts with respect to, nor
require the consent of any other Person in respect of, the Remington
Companies right to own, transfer, assign, license, use or hold for use any
Remington Intellectual Property as owned, used or held for use in the conduct
of the Remington Companies business as currently conducted.

 



     

 

 



 

(f) Except as would not have a Remington Material Adverse Effect, the
Remington Companies rights in the Remington Intellectual Property (other than
click wrap, shrink wrap licenses or other similar licenses for commercial off-
the-shelf software) are valid, subsisting and enforceable. The Remington
Companies have taken all reasonable steps to maintain the Remington
Intellectual Property (other than click wrap, shrink wrap licenses or other
similar licenses for commercial off-the-shelf software), except as would not
have a Remington Material Adverse Effect.

entered into by the Remington Companies involving the sale of goods or the
rendering of services in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

Companies not subject to claims of set-off or other defenses or counterclaims
other than normal cash discounts accrued in the ordinary course of business

with respect to accounts receivable arising after the Interim Balance Sheet

Interim Balance Sheet or the Marietta Interim Balance Sheet or, with respect
to accounts receivable arising after the Interim Balance Sheet Date, on the
accounting records of the Remington Companies have been determined in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, subject to normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of disclosures normally made in footnotes.

 



 

 **Section 3.15** ** Insurance**. _Schedule 3.15_ sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of all Insurance Policies. True, correct and complete copies
of the Insurance Policies have been made available to AINC. The Insurance
Policies are in full force and effect and will remain in full force and effect
following the consummation of the Transactions without any increase in
premium, charges, fees or penalties resulting from the Transactions. None of
the Remington Companies or any of their Affiliates (including the Bennetts)
has received any written notice of cancellation of, premium increase with
respect to, or alteration of coverage under, any Insurance Policies. All
premiums due on the Insurance Policies have either been paid or, if due and
payable prior to Closing, will be paid prior to Closing in accordance with the
payment terms of each Insurance Policy. The Insurance Policies do not provide
for any material retrospective premium adjustment or other experience-based
liability on the part of the Remington Companies. All Insurance Policies: (a)
are valid and binding in accordance with their terms; and (b) have not been
subject to any lapse in coverage. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15_ ,
there are no claims related to the business of the Remington Companies pending
under any such Insurance Policies as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed or in respect of which there is an outstanding reservation
of rights. None of the Remington Companies is in default under, or has
otherwise failed to comply with, in any material respect, any provision
contained in any Insurance Policy.

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(a)_, there are no Actions pending
or, to the Bennetts Knowledge, threatened: (i) against or by the Remington
Companies, in each case on or for their own accounts, affecting any of their
properties or assets in any material respect (or by or against any Remington
Party Related Party, in each case on or for its own account, and relating to
the Remington Companies); or (ii) against or by the Remington Companies or any
Remington Party Related Party, in each case on or for its own account, that
challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the Transactions,
which if determined adversely to the Remington Companies would be material to
the Remington Companies, taken as a whole, or would adversely affect the
ability of the Remington Companies to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(b),_ there are no material
outstanding Governmental Orders and no material unsatisfied judgments,
penalties or awards against or affecting the Remington Companies or any of the
Remington Companies properties or assets.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 3.16_ will not apply to any
Actions or Governmental Orders for which any of the Remington Companies or any
Remington Party Related Party is named therein solely as agent for a Person
that is not a Remington Company or a Remington Party Related Party.

 



 

 **Section 3.17** ** Compliance With Laws; Permits**.

 



 

(a) The Remington Companies are in compliance, in all material respects, with
all Laws applicable to them or their business, properties or assets.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 3.17_ lists all material Permits used in the Remington
Companies business issued to any of the Remington Companies, in each case on
or for its own account, including the names of the Permits and their
respective dates of issuance and expiration. All material Permits required to
conduct the Remington Companies business have been obtained and are valid and
in full force and effect, and will remain in full force and effect following
the consummation of the Transactions without any material increase in charges,
fees or penalties resulting from the Transactions. Such Permits comply in all
material respects with all requirements, terms and conditions of all Material
Contracts that require the Remington Companies to obtain or keep in force
Permits. All fees and charges with respect to such Permits have been paid in
full or, if due and payable prior to Closing, will be paid prior to Closing in
accordance with the payment terms of such Permit. To the Knowledge of the
Bennetts, no event has occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time
or both, would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, suspension,
lapse or limitation of any Permit set forth in _Schedule 3.17_. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 3.17_ will not apply to any Permits held in
the name of, or required to be held in the name of, any Person who is not a
Remington Company or a Remington Party

 



     

 

 



 

Related Party, even if a Remington Company or a Remington Party Related Party
acts as agent for such Person.

 



 

(c) None of the representations and warranties contained in this _Section
3.17_ will be deemed to relate to environmental matters (which are governed by
_Section 3.18_), employee benefits matters (which are governed by _Section
3.19_), employment matters (which are governed by _Section 3.20_) or Tax
matters (which are governed by _Section 3.21_).

 



 

 **Section 3.18** ** Environmental Matters**.

 



 

(a) To the Knowledge of the Bennetts, the Remington Companies are currently,
and at all times during the prior two years have been, in compliance in all
material respects with all Environmental Laws and, except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.18(a)_ , none of the Bennetts or any of the Remington Companies
has received from any Person any: (i) Environmental Notice or Environmental
Claim; or (ii) written request for information pursuant to Environmental Law,
which, in each case, relates to the business of the Remington Companies and
either remains pending or unresolved, or is the source of ongoing obligations
or requirements.

 



 

(b) To the Knowledge of the Bennetts, there has been no Release of Hazardous
Materials in contravention of Environmental Law with respect to the business
of the Remington Companies (excluding the assets and business operated by the
Remington Companies as agent) or assets owned by the Remington Companies or,
during the periods when any real property was operated by any of the Remington
Companies as agent for another Person, such real property operated by any of
the Remington Companies. During the periods when any real property was
operated by any of the Remington Companies as agent for another Person, none
of the Remington Companies or the Bennetts received an Environmental Notice
that any such real property (including soils, groundwater, surface water,
buildings and other structure located on any such real property) has been
contaminated with any Hazardous Material that could reasonably be expected to
result in an Environmental Claim against, or a violation of Environmental Law
or term of any Environmental Permit by the Remington Companies.

 



 

(c) The Remington Parties have provided or otherwise made available to AINC
any and all environmental reports, studies, audits, records, sampling data,
site assessments and other similar documents, if any, with respect to the
assets of the Remington Companies that are in the possession or control of the
Remington Companies related to compliance with Environmental Laws,
Environmental Claims or an Environmental Notice or the Release of Hazardous
Materials.

 



 

(d) The representations and warranties in this _Section 3.18_ are the
Remington Parties sole and exclusive representations and warranties regarding
environmental matters.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 3.19** ** Employee Benefit Matters**.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.19(a)_ contains a true and complete list of each material
pension, benefit, retirement, compensation, employment, consulting, profit-
sharing, deferred compensation, incentive, bonus, performance award, phantom
equity or other equity, change in control, retention, severance, vacation,

policy, program or arrangement (and any amendments thereto), in each case
whether or not reduced to writing and whether funded or unfunded, including
each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of § 3(3) of ERISA, whether or
not tax-qualified and whether or not subject to ERISA, which is or has been
maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by any
Remington Company following the Closing for the benefit of any current or
former employee, officer, manager, retiree, independent contractor or
consultant of any Remington Company or any spouse or dependent of such
individual, or under which any Remington Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates has or may have any material Liability, or with respect to which
New Holdco would reasonably be expected to have any material Liability,
contingent or otherwise (each, a " _Benefit Plan_ ").

 



 

(b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Remington Companies have made
available to AINC accurate, current and complete copies of each of the
following: (i) where the Benefit Plan has been reduced to writing, the plan
document together with all amendments; (ii) where the Benefit Plan has not
been reduced to writing, a written summary of all material plan terms; (iii)
where applicable, copies of any trust agreements or other funding
arrangements, custodial agreements, insurance policies and similar agreements
now in effect; (iv) copies of any summary plan descriptions, summaries of
material modifications, employee handbooks and any other material written
communications (or a description of any material oral communications) relating

be qualified under § 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most recent
determination, opinion or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service;

years; and (viii) copies of material notices, letters or other correspondence
from the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation or other Governmental Authority relating to the Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(c) Each Benefit Plan and related trust (other than any multiemployer plan
within the meaning of § 3(37) of ERISA) (each a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") has
been established, administered and maintained in accordance, in all material
respects, with its terms and in compliance, in all material respects, with all
applicable Laws (including ERISA, the Code, the Affordable Care Act and any
applicable local Laws). Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under § 401(a) of the Code (a " _Qualified Benefit Plan_ ") is so qualified
and has received a favorable and current determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, or with respect to a prototype plan, can rely on an
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the prototype plan
sponsor,

 



     

 

 



 

to the effect that such Qualified Benefit Plan is so qualified and that the
plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under
§§ 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and nothing has occurred that
could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Qualified Benefit Plans
tax-qualified status. Nothing has occurred within the past three years with
respect to any Benefit Plan that has subjected or could reasonably be expected
to subject the Remington Companies or, with respect to any period on or after
the Closing Date, AINC or any of its Affiliates, to a material penalty under §
502 of ERISA or to tax or material penalty under § 4975 of the Code.

respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange
Act) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of AINC (after the
formation thereof) and OAINC Inc and the consolidated Subsidiaries of the
foregoing as of the dates thereof and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to _Schedule 4.05(b)_ and
subject to, in the case of unaudited statements, normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein).

 



 

(c) The Proxy Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is first
mailed to AINCs stockholders or at the time of the Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be

 



     

 

 



 

stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made by AINC with respect to information
supplied by the Remington Parties or any of their Representatives for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement when filed, distributed
or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(d) AINC and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains a system
of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of AINC and its Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the AINC
Board, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of AINCs and its Subsidiaries assets that
could have a material effect on AINCs financial statements.

 



 

(e) AINCs "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all information
(both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by AINC in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to AINCs management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of AINC required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. AINC has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the
date of this Agreement, to AINCs auditors and the audit committee of the AINC
Board and on _Schedule 4.05(e)_ (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect AINCs ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in AINCs internal controls over financial
reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" will have the meaning assigned to them in Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 2, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Neither AINC nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities other than
Liabilities that (i) are reflected or recorded on AINC Balance Sheet
(including in the notes thereto), (ii) were incurred since the date of AINC
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business, (iii) are incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an AINC
Material Adverse Effect.

 



     

 

 



 

(g) Neither AINC nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among AINC and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, AINC or any of its
Subsidiaries in AINCs or such Subsidiarys published financial statements or
other AINC SEC Documents.

 



 

 **Section 4.06** **Absence of Certain Changes or Events**. Since the date of

of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, the business of
AINC and each of its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary course of
business and there has not been or occurred any AINC Material Adverse Effect
or any event, condition, change or effect that could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an AINC Material Adverse Effect.

or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date hereof; (d) result in the
creation of an Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrance) on any of the
properties or assets of AINC or any of its Subsidiaries. No consent, approval,
Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any
Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to AINC, New Holdco,
Merger Sub, or any of AINCs other Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents

 **Section 5.01** **Organization and Authority of New Holdco and Merger
Sub**. New Holdco is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the state of Nevada and has full corporate

constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of New Holdco and
Merger Sub enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

Transaction Documents to which New Holdco or Merger Sub is or will be a party
have been duly executed and delivered by such Party (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other parties thereto), such
Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding obligation of such
Party enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, except as such

AINC and its

 



     

 

 



 

Representatives full and free access to and the right to inspect all of the
Real Property, properties, assets, premises, books and records, Management

Representatives with such financial, operating and other data and information
related to the Remington Companies as AINC or any of its Representatives may
reasonably request; and (c) instruct the Representatives of the Remington
Companies to cooperate with AINC in its investigation of the Remington
Companies; provided that any such investigation will be conducted during
normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to the Bennetts and the
Remington Companies and in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal operations of the Remington Companies. No investigation by AINC or
other information received by AINC will operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the
Remington Companies or the Bennetts in this Agreement or in any other
Transaction Document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Bennetts or MJB Investments will be required to provide
copies of their individual Tax Returns or workpapers with respect thereto.

 



 

 **Section 6.03** ** No Solicitation by the Remington Companies or the
Bennetts**.

 



 

(a) None of the Remington Companies or the Bennetts will, and they will not
authorize or permit any of their Affiliates or any their Representatives to,
directly or indirectly: (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding a Remington Party Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to,
any Person concerning a possible Remington Party Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
enter into any agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether or not
binding) regarding a Remington Party Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) otherwise

conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, a Remington Party
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 6.03_, the
Remington Companies and the Bennetts will promptly (and in any event within
two Business Days after receipt thereof by any of the Remington Companies, the
Bennetts or their Representatives) advise AINC orally and in writing of any
Remington Party Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect
to any Remington Party Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or
which could reasonably be expected to result in a Remington Party Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Remington Party
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the
same.

 



 

(c) The Remington Companies and the Bennetts agree that the rights and
remedies for noncompliance with this _Section 6.03_ will include having such
provision specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it
being acknowledged

 



     

 

 



 

and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable
injury to AINC and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to
AINC.

 



 

 **Section 6.04** ** No Solicitation by AINC; No Adverse AINC
Recommendation**.

 



 

(a) AINC will not, and will not authorize or permit New Holdco, Merger Sub or
any of its other Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives (including
the Special Committee) to, directly or indirectly: (i) encourage, solicit,
initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an AINC Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person concerning a possible AINC Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) enter into any agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether or

Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted with respect to, or
that could lead to, an AINC Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.04(a)_, from the date of this Agreement until
the date that the Required Stockholder Vote has been obtained, following the
receipt by AINC of an unsolicited _bona fide_ written AINC Acquisition
Proposal: (i) the AINC Board and the Special Committee will be permitted to
participate in discussions regarding such AINC Acquisition Proposal solely to
clarify the terms of such AINC Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) if the AINC
Board determines in good faith: (A) that such AINC Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an AINC Superior
Proposal; and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take the actions set forth in _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below with
respect to such AINC Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its
duties to act in the best interests of AINC and its shareholders (other than
the Bennetts), then AINC may, in response to such AINC Acquisition Proposal:
(x) furnish access and non-public information with respect to AINC and its
Affiliates to the Person that has made such AINC Acquisition Proposal; and (y)
participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such AINC Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(c) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 6.04_, AINC will
promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours after receipt thereof by AINC or
its Representatives) notify the Remington Parties orally and in writing if any
inquiries, proposals or offers that could reasonably be expected to result in
an AINC Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter will keep the Remington Parties informed, on a current basis, of
the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any

 



     

 

 



 

amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in AINCs intentions as previously notified.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 6.04(e)_ and _Section 6.04(f)_, the
AINC Board or any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) will
not: (i) withdraw, modify or amend AINC Recommendation in any manner adverse
to the Remington Parties; (ii) approve, endorse or recommend an AINC
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) at any time following receipt of an AINC
Acquisition Proposal, fail to reaffirm its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement and the Transactions as promptly as practicable (but in any event
within five Business Days after receipt of any reasonable written request to
do so from the Bennetts) (any of the above, an " _Adverse AINC Recommendation_
").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the AINC Board or the Special Committee
may, at any time before obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, to the extent
it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties to act
in the best interests of AINC and its shareholders (other than the Bennetts),
in response to an AINC Superior Proposal received by the AINC Board or the
Special Committee, make an Adverse AINC Recommendation, but only if:

 



 

(i) AINC has first provided the Remington Parties prior written notice, at
least three Business Days in advance, that it intends to make such Adverse
AINC Recommendation and is prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into
a Contract with respect to an AINC Superior Proposal, which notice will
include the material terms and conditions of the transaction that constitutes
such AINC Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person making such AINC
Superior Proposal, and copies of any Contracts that are proposed to be entered
into with respect to such AINC Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) during the three Business Days after the receipt of such notice (it being
understood and agreed that any material change to the financial or other terms
and conditions of such AINC Superior Proposal will require an additional
notice to the Remington Parties of a two Business Day period that may, in
whole or in part, run concurrently with the initial three Business Day
period), AINC has, and has caused its Representatives to, negotiate with the
Remington Parties in good faith (to the extent the Remington Parties desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents so that there is no longer a
basis for such AINC Acquisition Proposal to constitute an AINC Superior
Proposal.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the AINC Board may, at any time before
obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, to the extent it determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its duties to act in the best interests
of AINC and its shareholders (other than the Bennetts), in response to an AINC
Intervening Event, make an Adverse AINC Recommendation, but only if:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) AINC has first provided the Remington Parties prior written notice, at
least three Business Days in advance, that it intends to make such Adverse
AINC Recommendation; and

 



 

(ii) during the three Business Days after the receipt of such notice, AINC
has, and has caused its Representatives to, negotiate with the Bennetts in
good faith (to the extent the Bennetts desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents so that there is no longer a basis for such withdrawal,
modification or amendment.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.04_ will be deemed to prohibit the
AINC Board from disclosing to the stockholders of AINC a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, _provided_ ,
that if such disclosure does not reaffirm AINC Recommendation or has the
substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying AINC Recommendation,
such disclosure will be deemed to be an Adverse AINC Recommendation (it being
understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains only
the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) will not be deemed to be an Adverse
AINC Recommendation).

 



 

(h) AINC agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 6.04_ will include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the
Remington Parties and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy
to the Remington Parties.

 



 

 **Section 6.05** ** Notice of Certain Remington Events**.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Remington Companies
and the Bennetts will promptly notify AINC in writing of:

 



 

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which: (A) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Remington Material Adverse Effect; (B) has
resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any representation
or warranty made by any of the Remington Companies or the Bennetts under this
Agreement not being true and correct; or (C) has resulted in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.02_ to be satisfied;

 



 

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

 



 

(iii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions; and

 



 

(iv) any Actions commenced or, to the Bennetts Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Remington Companies or the

relates to the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) AINCs receipt of information pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ will not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or

Document and will not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedules.

breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of termination rights contained in this Agreement or of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ have
been satisfied; _provided_ , however, that if AINC has the right to, but does
not elect to, terminate this Agreement within seven Business Days of its

have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to
such matter.

Organizational Documents to establish a record date for, duly and promptly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholder Meeting. AINC will

_Section 6.04(e)_ and _Section 6.04(f)_) that the stockholders of AINC
authorize and approve this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with §
2-507 of the MGCL (the " _AINC_ _Recommendation_ ") at the Stockholder
Meeting, and AINC will include the AINC Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
(subject to _Section 6.04(d)_, _Section 6.04(e)_ and _Section 6.04(f)_),
and, subject to _Section 6.04(d)_, _Section 6.04(e)_ and _Section 6.04(f)_,
will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from AINCs stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions. If,
at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting any information relating to the
Remington Parties or AINC or any of their respective Affiliates should be
discovered that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information will promptly notify the other Parties and, to the
extent required by Law will disseminate an appropriate amendment thereof or
supplement thereto describing such information to the stockholders of AINC.
Notwithstanding the

 



     

 

 



 

immediately preceding sentence, each of AINC, the Remington Companies, and the
Remington Parties agrees and covenants that: (i) none of the information with
respect to such Party supplied or to be supplied by such Party for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement contains or will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; and (ii) prior to
AINC filing the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC, such Party will
review the preliminary Proxy Statement and represent that the Proxy Statement
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

 



 

(b) The Remington Companies and the Remington Parties agree to cooperate with
AINC in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and, as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, will furnish AINC with all information
relating to it and required pursuant to the Exchange Act rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to the set forth in the Proxy Statement. AINC will

SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will
promptly supply the Remington Parties with copies of all correspondence
between AINC or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the
Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the
other Parties, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the
SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC
or its staff, with respect to the Proxy Statement will be made by AINC without
providing the Remington Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and propose
comments on the Proxy Statement.

84-111, and (iii) in this connection, for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(and applicable state and local tax purposes), (A) the holders of AINC Stock
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or state and local tax purposes, as
applicable) will be treated as transferring their AINC Stock to New Holdco
pursuant to the Merger, (B) Archie Bennett, Jr., his spouse, Monty J. Bennett

information and, if requested by the other Parties, will consult with each
other in good faith in preparing such

 



     

 

 



 

information. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, none of
the Parties will take (and, in the case of AINC, AINC will cause the AINC
Parties to not take) a position inconsistent with the treatment described in
this _Section 7.01(a)_ on any Tax Return, or otherwise, except (1) as
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of §

Appointee and AINC (or its applicable permitted successor or assign pursuant

any Governmental Authority is challenging, or requesting information
regarding, such tax treatment or the treatment described in _Section
7.01(b)_. For purposes of this _Article VII_, for the avoidance of doubt, any
action or position taken by any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar
group including any Party shall also be deemed to be taken by such Party.

 



 

(b) Prior to any AINC Party (or any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar
group including any AINC Party) or any other Party taking any position on a
Tax Return or in connection with any Tax Claim or Action or any federal income
tax position reflected in audited financial statements that, in any of the
foregoing cases (i) is inconsistent with the treatment of the Bennetts, Cowen,
Welter, and MJB Investments as not recognizing any gain or income pursuant to
the Transactions (other than with respect to any cash received by the
Remington WC Parties as a Closing Adjustment or Post-Closing Adjustment
pursuant to _Section 2.06_ or the payment for the Non-Compete in accordance
with _Section 7.01(f)_), (ii) is taken pursuant to clause (2) of _Section
7.01(a)_ (relating to a change in, or clarification or interpretation of, the
Tax Law), or (iii) could reasonably be expected to otherwise adversely affect
the tax treatment to any Party (other than an AINC Party) of the Transactions
or the New Holdco Stock in any material respect, New Holdco (in the case of a
position taken by any AINC Party or any consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar group including any AINC Party) or such other Party, as applicable,
shall notify each Bennett Appointee and AINC of such position and give each
Bennetts Appointee a reasonable opportunity to dispute such position. The
Parties shall, and New Holdco shall cause the AINC Parties to, cooperate in
good faith to resolve any such dispute. In addition, if Monty J. Bennett
ceases to be the principal executive officer of New Holdco prior to the Second
Tax Year End, New Holdco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each preferred distribution on the New Holdco Preferred Stock made during or
after the calendar year that Monty J. Bennett ceases to be the principal
executive officer of New Holdco and on or prior to the Second Tax Year End to
be funded by distributions made by New Holdcos direct or indirect operating
subsidiaries out of earnings and profits to the extent of such operating
subsidiaries earnings and profits, except to the extent both Bennett
Appointees provide prior written consent for alternative funding.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of AINC, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, Remington
(and its Representatives) will not, and will not permit any other Remington
Company to: (i) make, change or rescind any Tax election of a Remington
Company that would be binding on such Remington Company for a Post-Closing Tax
Period or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the AINC Parties,
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
(or as otherwise required by Law or expressly contemplated by the Transaction
Documents); (ii) amend any Tax Return of any of the Remington Companies
(including by administrative adjustment request) to the extent such amendment
would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax
asset of the AINC Parties in respect of any Post-Closing Tax Period, other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (or as
otherwise required by Law or expressly contemplated by the Transaction
Documents); (iii) enter into an agreement extending the statute of limitations
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Remington Company other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (iv) enter into
a closing agreement with any Governmental Authority with respect to any Tax
matter that will be binding on any of the Remington Companies after the
Closing with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period; (v) seek a private letter
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or other Governmental Authority
relating to any Tax matter of the Remington Companies (other than the Private
Letter Ruling) that would be binding on any of the Remington Companies after
the Closing with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period; or (vi) settle or
compromise any Tax liability, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. Prior to the Closing, the Remington Companies
will timely pay all Taxes due and payable by them.

 



 

(d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other similar Taxes and similar fees (including any penalties and interest
thereon and including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar
Tax) (each, a " _Transfer Tax_ ") incurred in connection with the Remington
Contribution Transaction will be borne and paid by Archie Bennett, Jr. and MJB
Investments (on behalf of themselves or their Affiliates), as applicable and
subject to _Section 11.01_, when due, and all Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the Merger and any restructuring of the New Holdco and AINC
group or the assets thereof will be borne and paid by AINC when due. Archie
Bennett, Jr. and MJB Investments (on behalf of themselves or their
Affiliates), and the AINC Parties, as applicable, will cooperate to timely
file any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Transfer Taxes, and
the expense of filing such Tax Returns or other documents (" _Transfer Tax
Return Expenses_ ") will be borne by the party responsible for paying the
applicable tax (subject to _Section 11.01_).

 



 

(e) The Remington Parties will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely
file, or caused to be timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by
any Remington Company on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any
applicable extensions). Subject to the limitations of _Section 7.01(c)_, all
such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice of the
Remington Companies and without a change of any election or any accounting
method except, in each case, as

 



     

 

 



 

otherwise required by applicable Law or to be consistent with the Transaction
Documents. The Bennett Appointee will submit to New Holdco for its review any
such Tax Return that is an IRS Form 1065 prior to the filing thereof and will
consider in good faith any comments made by New Holdco thereto. The Bennett
Appointee will submit to New Holdco any such income, franchise or similar Tax
Return (other than an IRS Form 1065) prior to, or as soon as practicable
after, the filing thereof. New Holdco will prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be
filed by any Remington Company after the Closing Date (taking into account any
applicable extensions) that have not been filed before the Closing (including,
for this purpose, any Schedules K-1 (or similar state, local or foreign
schedules or Tax Returns) required to be provided to partners/members with
respect to such Tax Returns). All such Tax Returns (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any applicable Schedules K-1 (or similar state, local or
foreign schedules or Tax Returns)) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period will be prepared in accordance with the past practice of the Remington
Companies, without a change of any election or any accounting method (except,
in each case, as otherwise required by applicable Law, required to consummate
the Transactions, or consented to by both Bennett Appointees), and in a manner
consistent with the Transaction Documents. New Holdco will submit to the
Bennett Appointees for their review and approval any such Tax Return that is
an income, franchise or similar Tax Return (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any applicable IRS Form 1065, any applicable Schedules K-1 (or similar
state, local or foreign schedules or Tax Returns) and any statement provided
by reason of a Section 6226 Election) prior to the filing thereof as soon as
practicable prior to the due date thereof (including extensions). The costs of
preparation of such Tax Returns will be borne and paid by New Holdco (subject
to the Transition Cost Sharing Agreement). If either Bennett Appointee objects
to any item on, or otherwise has any objections with respect to, any such
income, franchise or similar Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period prepared (or caused to be prepared) by New Holdco, such
Bennett Appointee will, within 20 days after delivery of such Tax Return,
notify New Holdco in writing that such Bennett Appointee so objects,
specifying with particularity any such item or other objection and stating the
specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of
objection will be duly delivered, New Holdco and such Bennett Appointee will
negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such
items or other objections. If New Holdco and the Bennett Appointees are unable
to reach such agreement within ten Business Days after receipt by New Holdco
of such notice, the disputed items or objections will be resolved by the
Independent Accountant and any determination by the Independent Accountant
will be final. The Independent Accountant will resolve any disputed items and
objections within 20 days of having the dispute referred to it pursuant to
such procedures as it may require. If the Independent Accountant is unable to
resolve any disputed items or objections before the due date for such Tax
Return, New Holdco will cause the Tax Return to be timely filed reflecting any
changes requested by the Bennett Appointees (to the extent both Bennett
Appointees agree to such change), and then amended to reflect the Independent
Accountants resolution, to the extent such resolution differs from the Tax
Return originally filed by New Holdco (or AINC Party, as applicable). The
costs, fees and expenses of the Independent

 



     

 

 



 

Accountant will be borne by New Holdco and the Bennetts in the same proportion
by which their respective positions as initially presented to the Independent
Accountant (based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a whole)
differs from the final resolution as determined by the Independent Accountant.
To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Bennetts (and/or, with respect
to any applicable state or local tax law under which MJB Investments is a
regarded entity, MJB Investments), Cowen and Welter will include any income,
gain, loss, deduction or other tax items of Remington or Marietta Leasehold LP
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods on their U.S. federal income Tax Returns (and,
as appropriate, applicable state and local income Tax Returns) in a manner
consistent with the Tax Schedules furnished by Remington or Marietta, as
applicable, to the Bennetts (and/or MJB Investments), Cowen and Welter after
the Closing Date for such periods; _provided_ that the Bennetts and MJB
Investments shall not be required to report income, gain, loss, deduction or
other tax items consistently with any Schedule K-1 if any AINC Party breached
any provision of this Agreement (including this _Article VII_) in connection
with the preparation or delivery of such Schedule K-1 or any associated Tax
Return (including any associated IRS Form 1065) or the resolution of any
related Tax Claim and such breach materially prejudiced the ability of the
Bennett Appointees or MJB Investments to directly or indirectly affect the
contents of such Schedule K-1. No election (if available) comparable to the
election under Section 706 of the Code, or Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii), for the ratable allocation of income shall be made with
respect to any Remington Company for the taxable year in which the Closing
takes place, without the prior written consent of the Bennett Appointees and
AINC. The Parties agree that, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by both
of the Bennetts, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Tax law, any
deduction resulting from a payment made by any Remington Company in connection
with the Closing or the Transactions shall be treated as a deduction for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article VII_, subject to the Transition Cost Sharing Agreement, none of the
AINC Parties will have the right to prepare or file any Tax Return of Kylemore
Investments, LP (including any Tax Return for an affiliated, combined,
consolidated, unitary or similar group that includes Kylemore Investments,
LP).

 



 

(f) The Parties agree that the value of the Non-Compete for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and all other applicable purposes is $10,000. Of this
$10,000 value, an amount equal to $5,000 is allocable to Archie Bennett, Jr.,
and an amount equal to $5,000 is allocable to Monty J. Bennett. The
consideration paid by the AINC Parties for such Non-Compete is the
reimbursement by New Holdco to the Remington WC Parties of an applicable
portion of the Transaction Costs under _Section 11.01_ that are reimbursed
(rather than paid directly by New Holdco) in an amount equal to the Non-
Compete Value. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, none of the Parties will take (and AINC shall
cause each AINC Party to not take) any position on any Tax Return, or
otherwise, that is inconsistent with this _Section 7.01(f)_, except (i) as
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of §
1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of any state, local or
foreign law) or (ii) with the prior written consent of each Bennett Appointee
and AINC (or its applicable permitted successor or assign pursuant

 



     

 

 



 

to _Section 11.06_); _provided_ that each of the AINC Parties, the Bennett
Appointees and MJB Investments shall be entitled to settle any deficiency or
adjustment proposed by any taxing authority resulting from a challenge to such
treatment (after providing written notice of the proposed settlement to the
others) to the extent such settlement is not binding on (and could not
otherwise adversely affect) Archie Bennett, Jr. (other than in the case of a
settlement by Archie Bennett, Jr.), Monty J. Bennett (other than in the case
of a settlement by Monty J. Bennett or MJB Investments), MJB Investments
(other than in the case of a settlement by Monty J. Bennett or MJB
Investments) or the AINC Parties (other than in the case of a settlement by
any of the AINC Parties). The AINC Parties and each Bennett Appointee will
promptly notify each other upon receipt of written notice by such Party (or,
in the case of AINC, any of the AINC Parties) that any Governmental Authority
is challenging, or requesting information regarding, the treatment described
in this _Section 7.01(f)_.

 



 

(g) The AINC Parties, Cowen, Welter, MJB Investments and the Bennetts will not
knowingly (and, as applicable, will cause their respective subsidiaries to
not): (i) take any action, or fail to take any action, as a result of which
the Exchanges would fail to qualify as an exchange described in § 351 of the
Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local law) or the
Merger would fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of §
368(a); or (ii) enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement
to take or fail to take any such action; _provided_ that each Party may
undertake any transaction expressly contemplated in the Transaction Documents.
Each of the AINC Parties, Cowen, Welter, MJB Investments and the Bennetts will
use commercially reasonable efforts (and, as applicable, cause their
respective subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts) to cause the
Exchanges to qualify as an exchange described in § 351 of the Code (and any
comparable provisions of applicable foreign, state or local law) and the
Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of § 368(a).

 



 

(h) Upon the request of the Bennett Appointees, New Holdco will cause the
applicable Remington Company to make a Section 6226 Election (and follow the
procedures required in connection with such election) with respect to any
imputed underpayment (within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code or a
similar provision of state or local law) relating to a Remington Company for a
Pre Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

 



 

 **Section 7.02 Prohibited Actions**. Subject to and to the extent not
inconsistent with _Section 7.05_, without the prior written consent of the
Bennett Appointees (which consent will not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld), the AINC Parties will not (and will cause their
Affiliates, subsidiaries and any Partnership Representative (other than a
Bennett Appointee), and their respective Representatives, to not): (a) amend
any Tax Return of any Remington Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period (including by administrative adjustment request), file a Tax
Return of a Remington Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction
where such Remington Company has not historically filed Tax Returns, or file a
Tax Return for a Remington Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period other

 



     

 

 



 

than in accordance with _Section 7.01(e)_; (b) initiate contact with taxing
authorities regarding Taxes, Tax Returns or Tax items of any Remington Company
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than with respect to Tax
Returns required to be filed by New Holdco pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)
_(with respect to which New Holdco shall first consult with the Bennett
Appointees regarding such contact prior to making such contact); (c) make any
voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes or Tax items of any Remington
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than with respect to Tax Returns
required to be filed by New Holdco pursuant to _Section 7.01(e) _(with
respect to which New Holdco shall first consult with the Bennett Appointees
regarding such voluntary disclosure prior to making such voluntary
disclosure); (d) make or change any Tax election, adopt or change any
accounting method or convention, or take any Tax position on any Tax Return,
that could reasonably be expected to result in any increased Tax liability,
income or gain, or reduction of any Tax deduction, loss or other Tax asset of
a Remington Company or the Bennetts for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except in
the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with the past practice
of the Remington Companies; (e) make any Tax election that has retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Remington Company; (f) otherwise
take any action to the extent such action could reasonably be expected to
create or increase a claim with respect to this Agreement with respect to
Taxes, or could reasonably be expected to increase the taxable income or gain
(or decrease the taxable losses, credits or deductions) allocated to the
Bennetts or any Remington Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period;
(g) enter into a settlement agreement with the IRS in respect of the Remington
Companies which purports to bind the Bennett Appointees, the Bennetts, the
General Partner or MJB Investments; (h) file a petition pursuant to Section
6234 of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local law) for or
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of a Remington
Company; (i) intervene in any action of or relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (other than a Straddle Period) of a Remington Company in United States
Tax Court, any United States District Court or the United States Court of
Federal Claims; (j) make an election under Code § 6226 (or any similar
provision of state or local law) (a " _Section 6226 Election_") with respect
to any imputed underpayment with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period of a Remington Company; _provided_ that, if New Holdco timely
requests the consent of the Bennett Appointees to make a Section 6226 Election
with respect to a final partnership adjustment of a Remington Company and the
Bennett Appointees withhold consent to make such Section 6226 Election, then
the Bennetts shall deposit (or, in the case of an adjustment with respect to
Marietta Leasehold LP, the Bennetts and the Marietta Class B Holders will
deposit) with New Holdco an amount equal to the portion of the "imputed
underpayment" (within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code) resulting from
such adjustment that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (net of any
portion of such Taxes reflected as a liability in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital) (a " _Section 6226 Deposit_") on or prior to the later of
(1) the day that is five Business Days after the receipt by the Bennett
Appointees of a written request by New Holdco for such amount and (2) the day
that is five Business Days prior to the last day to make such Section 6226
Election; _provided_ , further, that if a Section 6226 Election is not made
with respect to an imputed underpayment for any reason, New Holdco will timely
pay (or cause to be timely paid) such imputed underpayment (in any event, at
least four Business Days prior

 



     

 

 



 

to the date described in Section 6232(f)(1) of the Code or any similar
provision of state or local law) to the applicable taxing authority and will
simultaneously repay to the depositors of any Section 6226 Deposit any portion
of the Section 6226 Deposit that is not used to pay such imputed underpayment
(with the aggregate amount repaid being paid pro rata to each depositor, with
the pro ration based on the portion of the Section 6226 Deposit with respect
to such imputed underpayment made by each depositor); (k) enter into an
agreement extending the statute of limitations relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period of any Remington Company; or (l) make an election under Section 6221 of
the Code with respect to any Remington Company. Without the prior written
consent of New Holdco (which consent will not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld), the Bennetts, Cowen and Welter will not (and will
cause their Affiliates (other than any AINC Party) to not) file any Tax Return
in a manner that is not consistent with the Transaction Documents. The Parties
shall not make (and shall cause their Affiliates to not make) the election
contemplated by Section 1101(g)(4) of the Bipartisan Budget Act and the
Treasury Regulations under Section 1101(g)(4) of the Bipartisan Budget Act
(including Treas. Reg. § 301.9100-22) with respect to a Remington Company to
make the partnership audit procedures of the Bipartisan Budget Act apply to a
taxable year of any Remington Company beginning before January 1, 2018, unless
all of the Bennett Appointees and New Holdco agree in writing to make such
election.

 



 

 **Section 7.03Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements**. Any and all
existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not), other than Excluded
Tax Contracts, binding upon any Remington Company will be terminated as of the
Closing Date. After such date none of the Remington Companies will have any
further rights or liabilities thereunder.

 



 

 **Section 7.04 ****Straddle Period**. In the case of Taxes that are payable
with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that are
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period for purposes of this Agreement will
be:

 



 

(a) in the case of: (A) Taxes based upon, or measured by, income, receipts,
profits, or payroll; (B) sales, use and similar Taxes imposed in connection
with the sale, transfer or assignment of property; or (C) withholding Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to a particular payment, deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing
Date; _provided_ that any taxable income or gain resulting from any
restructuring of the AINC or New Holdco group or the assets thereof or from
any action taken by an AINC Party after the Closing not in the ordinary course
of business or not consistent with the Transaction Documents shall be
allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period for this purpose; and

 



 

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire period.

 



 

 **Section 7.05 Contests**. New Holdco agrees to give written notice to the
Bennett Appointees of the receipt of any written notice by any AINC Party, and
the Bennetts

 



      

 

 



 

agree to give to New Holdco written notice of the receipt of any written
notice by any of them or MJB Investments, of a Tax Claim which could result in
liability for, or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the other
Party. The Bennett Appointees shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
control, at their own expense (taking into account payments made under the
Transition Cost Sharing Agreement), the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim
that relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , that, (a) the
Bennett Appointees will have provided written notice to New Holdco within 30
days of the receipt of written notice of the Tax Claim of their intention to
control such Tax Claim, and (b) the Bennett Appointees will obtain the prior
written consent of New Holdco (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) before entering into any settlement or concession of such Tax
Claim if such settlement or concession could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect any AINC Party; _provided_ , further, that to the extent such
Tax Claim could reasonably be expected to adversely affect any AINC Party or
relates to any entity-level Tax liability of a Remington Company, (x) New
Holdco will be entitled to participate in the defense of such Tax Contest and
to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose, the fees and expenses of
which separate counsel will be borne by New Holdco, and (y) the Bennett
Appointee will promptly keep New Holdco reasonably informed of all material
developments related to such Tax Claim, promptly provide New Holdco with
copies of (and a reasonable opportunity to comment on) all written materials
to be provided to the applicable Governmental Authority (including good faith
consideration of any such comments) related to such Tax Claim (or the relevant
excerpts thereof), and promptly provide New Holdco with copies of any
correspondence received from the applicable Governmental Authority related to
such Tax Claim (or relevant excerpts thereof). The AINC Parties may control
the contest or resolution of and defend against any Tax Claim to the extent
the Bennett Appointees are not entitled to control such Tax Claim, or have not
timely notified the AINC Parties that they will control such Tax Claim,
pursuant to the preceding sentence, at the sole cost and expense of the AINC
Parties; _provided_ that the AINC Parties will promptly notify the Bennett
Appointees upon taking control of such Tax Claim and the Bennett Appointees
will be entitled to participate in the defense of such Tax Claim and to employ
counsels of their choice for such purpose, the fees and expenses of which
separate counsel will be borne by the respective Remington Parties (taking
into account payments made under the Transition Cost Sharing Agreement);
_provided_ further that (i) such Tax Claim may not be settled or conceded
without the prior written consent of the Bennett Appointees, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii) the AINC Parties will
promptly keep the Bennett Appointees reasonably informed of all material
developments related to such Tax Claim, promptly provide the Bennett
Appointees with copies of (and a reasonable opportunity to comment on) all
written materials to be provided to the applicable Governmental Authority
(including good faith consideration of any such comments) related to such Tax
Claim (or the relevant excerpts thereof), and promptly provide the Bennett
Appointees with copies of any correspondence received from the applicable
Governmental Authority related to such Tax Claim (or the relevant excerpts
thereof). In the event of a conflict between this _Section 7.05_ and any
other section of this Agreement, this _Section 7.05_ will govern with respect
to the control of Tax Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article VII_, subject to the Transition Cost Sharing Agreement, none of the
AINC Parties

     

 

 



 

will have any rights with respect to any Tax Claim with respect to Kylemore
Investments, LP (including any Tax Claim with respect to an affiliated,
combined, consolidated, unitary or similar group that includes Kylemore
Investments, LP) that is not with respect to any Remington Company (other than
RHC).

 



 

 **Section 7.06 Cooperation and Exchange of Information**. The Bennetts and
the AINC Parties will provide each other with such cooperation and information
(including the relevant portions of books and records) as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this
_Article VII_ or in connection with any Tax Claim, audit or other proceeding
in respect of Taxes, tax items or Tax Returns of the Remington Companies,
including the execution of any power of attorney that is reasonably required
in connection with a Tax Claim controlled by the Bennett Appointees pursuant
to _Section 7.05_ and information related to any imputed underpayment within
the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code (including, at the request of the
Bennett Appointees, any information required to file an amended return
pursuant to Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code). Such cooperation and information
will also include the AINC Parties providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities
(or applicable portions thereof). New Holdco will retain all Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession (or
in the possession of any AINC Party) relating to Tax matters of any Remington
Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate. Prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of any Remington Companies
for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, the AINC Parties
will provide the Bennett Appointees with reasonable written notice and offer
the Bennett Appointees the opportunity to take custody of such materials.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
the Bennetts be required to provide their personal Tax Returns or workpapers
related thereto to any Person.

 



 

 **Section 7.07 ****Survival**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the provisions of _Section 3.21_, _Section 4.08_ and this
_Article VII_ will survive for the full period of all applicable statutes of
limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof)
plus six months.

 



 

 **Section 7.08 Remington Companies, AINC and OAINC Inc**. New Holdco shall
cause each Remington Company (other than Remington Lodging and Hospitality 
Linthicum LLC and Remington Lodging and Hospitality  Annapolis LLC and, if
applicable, RHC) to remain in existence and be treated as a disregarded entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and any applicable foreign, state or
local tax purposes, to the extent permitted under applicable law) for all
taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning at or after the effective time
of the Remington Contribution and ending on or prior to the two-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, except to the extent each of the Bennett
Appointees provides prior written consent for an alternative treatment. New

 



     

 

 



 

Holdco shall cause Remington Lodging and Hospitality  Linthicum LLC and
Remington Lodging and Hospitality  Annapolis LLC to remain in existence and
be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and any
applicable foreign, state or local tax purposes, to the extent permitted under
applicable law) for all taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning at or
after the effective time of the Remington Contribution and ending on or prior
to the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date, except to the extent each of
the Bennett Appointees provides prior written consent for an alternative
treatment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the prior
written consent of each of the Bennett Appointees, New Holdco will ensure that
no election is made for any Remington Company (other than Remington Lodging
and Hospitality  Linthicum LLC and Remington Lodging and Hospitality 
Annapolis LLC) to be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and that no election is made for any Remington Company (other than
Remington Lodging and Hospitality  Linthicum LLC and Remington Lodging and
Hospitality  Annapolis LLC) to be taxable as a corporation for any applicable
foreign, state or local tax purposes) for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date
(including any Pre-Closing Tax Period). AINC hereby confirms that neither it,
New Holdco nor OAINC Inc. has any current plan or intension to dissolve or
liquidate (or allow itself to be treated as having been dissolved or
liquidated, or being in the process of dissolving or liquidating, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes or applicable foreign, state or local tax
purposes), merge into any Person, or transfer all or substantially all of its
assets.

Inc. and their Affiliates, Cowen and Welter shall execute and deliver to tax
counsel for the Bennetts certificates in the form agreed to by the Parties at
such time or times as may reasonably be requested by such tax counsel, in
connection with such tax counsels delivery of the opinion pursuant to
_Section 8.03(j)_. Each AINC Party, Cowen and Welter shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (and cause its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to use

action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and
representations included in the certificates described in this _Section
7.09_.

 



 

 **Section 7.10 Tax Opinions**. AINC shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take or cause to be taken any action reasonably necessary to ensure
the receipt of the opinions described in _Section 8.01(g), Section 8.02(h)_
and _Section 8.03(j)_ and will cooperate with the counsel or accountants that

Advisors (or such other applicable counsel) certificates at such time or times
and in such form as reasonably requested by the recipient in connection with
such recipients delivery of such opinion. Subject to the final sentence of

certificates provided by it described in this _Section 7.10_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Bennetts, MJB
Investments or the Remington Companies shall bear or be responsible for any

 **Section 7.11**. **The Private Letter Ruling.** The AINC Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken any action
reasonably necessary to ensure the receipt of the Private Letter Ruling.

Treasury Regulations § 1.1445-2(b) that such Person is not a foreign person
within the meaning of § 1445 of the Code and such other documents or
instruments as AINC reasonably requests and are reasonably necessary to

 **Section 7.13 Refunds. **Except to the extent treated as an asset in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, any refunds (or credits for
overpayment) of Taxes of the Remington Companies, including any interest
received from a Governmental Authority thereon, attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the Remington Companies will be for the account of the
Remington WC Parties. Promptly upon Remingtons (or any of its Affiliates)
receipt of any such refund (or credit for overpayment), New Holdco will cause
to be paid over any such refund (or the amount of any such credit), including
any interest thereon but net of the amount of any costs, fees, expenses or
Taxes incurred by New Holdco or its Affiliates in obtaining such refunds (or
credits for overpayment) and net of any other unpaid amount otherwise owed to
New Holdco by the Bennetts or MJB Investments under the terms of this
Agreement (which previously unpaid amount shall then be treated as having been
paid by the Bennetts or MJB Investments, as applicable, for purposes of this
Agreement to the extent of such netting), to the Remington WC Parties within
15 days of receipt or entitlement thereto, with each such Remington WC Party
being entitled to receive half of such amounts; _provided_ , however, that the
Remington WC Parties will be obligated to return to New Holdco the amount, if
any, by which the amount of such refund actually paid over to the Remington WC
Parties is thereafter reduced by the relevant Governmental Authority, together
with interest payable thereon imposed by such Governmental Authority.

 **Restrictions on Transfer of Company Preferred Stock; Put Option**

 



 

2.01 _Restrictions on Transfer_.

 



 

(a) _Transfers to Prohibited Beneficial Owners_. Until the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, no Covered Investor may effect any Transfer
to any Person that is or would become a Prohibited Beneficial Owner as a
result of such Transfer, except: (i) pursuant to an Intra-Group Transfer; (ii)
as a result of any voting agreement between Archie Bennett, Jr. and Monty J.
Bennett; (iii) a Transfer in which no transferee (or group of Affiliated or
Associated transferees) would purchase or receive two percent (2%) or more of
the outstanding voting Company Shares (regardless of the number of voting
Company Shares held by any such transferee prior to any such Transfer); (iv)
in connection with any widespread public distribution of Company Shares
registered under the Securities Act; or (v) a Transfer to any transferee (or
group of Affiliated or Associated transferees) that would Beneficially Own
more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Company Shares without any
Transfer from a Covered Investor; provided, that, the restriction set forth in
this _Section 2.01(a)_ may be waived by the affirmative vote of the majority
of the stockholders of the Company that are not Affiliates or Associates of
the Covered Investors.

 



 

(b) _Status of Transferees; Joinder_. Any transferee from a Covered Investor
will be bound by the terms of this Agreement as follows: (i) transferees in an
Intra-Group Transfer or a Permitted Transfer (collectively, " _Joinder
Transferees_ ") will be Covered Investors for the purposes of this Agreement;
and (ii) transferees that are Covered Investors will continue to be Covered
Investors. As a condition to any Transfer, Joinder Transferees and transferees
that are Covered Investors must become a party to, and agree to be bound by,
all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a Covered Investor by a
joinder agreement that binds such transferee to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, as may be amended on the date of such joinder, as though a
party hereto.

 



 

(c) _Compliance with Securities Law_. Shares of Company Preferred Stock may
not be Transferred in the absence of an effective registration statement under
or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
all applicable state securities laws.

 



 

(d) _Non-Compliant Transfers Void_. Any Transfer of shares of Company
Preferred Stock that is not made in full compliance with the requirements of
this _Section 2.01_ (or otherwise contemplated by _Sections 2.02_ ) will be
null and void, and the Company will refuse to recognize such Transfer and will
not reflect on its records any change in ownership of shares of Company
Preferred Stock pursuant to such Transfer.

 



     

 

 



 

2.02 _Put Following a Change in Control_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to each Covered Investor an option, exercisable
with respect to each and every Change of Control that may occur following the
date of this Agreement, to sell to the Company, and the Company is obligated
to purchase from such Covered Investor, all or any portion of the Company
Preferred Stock then owned by such Covered Investor (the " _Change of Control
Put Option_ "), which right may be waived at the option of any such Covered
Investor with respect to a particular Change of Control or in its entirety,
any such waiver being irrevocable. The Change of Control Put Option may only
be exercised by a Covered Investor, in its sole discretion, on the date of the
consummation of each particular Change of Control, or during the ten (10)
Business Day period following the date of the consummation of such Change of
Control, provided that an exercising Covered Investor may provide written
notice of such exercise to the Company in advance of the anticipated date of
the consummation of such Change of Control as provided in _Section 2.02(b)_.
In the event that a Covered Investor exercises the Change of Control Put
Option, the price to be paid by the Company to such exercising Covered
Investor for each share of the Company Preferred Stock then owned by such
Covered Investor which is the subject of such option exercise will be an
amount equal to the Company Preferred Stock Cash Amount, payable, at each such
Covered Investors individual election not later than five (5) Business Days
before the scheduled Put Option Closing, in any combination of: (i) cash; or
(ii) a number of shares of Company Common Stock determined by dividing such
amount by the Conversion Price. To the extent that a Covered Investor
continues to hold shares of Company Preferred Stock following the consummation
of a Change of Control, such Covered Investor shall continue to have the right
to exercise the Change of Control Put Option with respect to any succeeding
Change of Control that may take place.

 



 

(b) The closing for the purchase and sale pursuant to the Change of Control
Put Option will take place at the executive offices of the Company on the date
specified in the exercising Covered Investors written notice to the Company
of its exercise of such option (a " _Put Option Closing_ "), which written
notice may be delivered by such Covered Investor in advance of the anticipated
date of the consummation of the Change of Control. The closing date specified
in such written notice will be a date no fewer than thirty (30) nor more than
sixty (60) days after the date of such notice; provided that in no event shall
the closing date occur prior to the consummation of the applicable Change of
Control. At any Put Option Closing, the exercising Covered Investor will
deliver good and marketable title to the Company Preferred Stock being
purchased and sold, duly endorsed in blank and otherwise in good form for
transfer (if applicable), free and clear of any lien, charge, claim, or
encumbrance other than this Agreement. In consideration

 



     

 

 



 

for the same, the Company will deliver the consideration set forth in this
_Section 2.02_.

 



 

2.03 _Adjustment to Conversion Price_. If the Company, at any time or from
time to time after the Closing Date: (a) pays a dividend or makes any other
distribution for no consideration to holders of the Company Common Stock in
any other capital stock of the Company or in shares of Company Common Stock or
securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for shares
of Company Common Stock; or (b) subdivides (by any stock split,
recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price applicable to the Change
of Control Put Option in effect immediately prior to any such dividend,
distribution or subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at
any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) its
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
the Conversion Price applicable to the Change of Control Put Option in effect
immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any
adjustment under this _Section 2.03 _shall become effective at the close of
business on the date the dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination
becomes effective.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
Additional Covenants**

 



 

3.01 _Company Board Nomination Rights_.

 



 

(a) In addition to the Company Board nomination rights specified in _Section
3.01(c)_, for so long as the Covered Investors are, in the aggregate, a Major
Investor, Archie Bennett, Jr., during his lifetime, and a Majority in Interest
of the Covered Investors thereafter, will be entitled to nominate one
individual (other than Archie Bennett, Jr.), and Monty J. Bennett, during his
lifetime, and a Majority in Interest of the Covered Investors thereafter, will
be entitled to nominate one additional individual (other than Archie Bennett,
Jr.) (each such individual so nominated, and any successor to each such
individual as contemplated by this _Section 3.01(a)_, individually, the "
_Seller Nominee_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Nominees_ ") for election
as a member of the Company Board. Initially, Monty J. Bennett shall serve as
the Seller Nominee of Monty J. Bennett, and W. Michael Murphy shall serve as
the Seller Nominee of Archie Bennett, Jr.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees: (i) to assure that the size of the Company Board will
accommodate the Seller Nominees; (ii) that at each annual meeting of
stockholders of the Company, the Company: (A) will cause the slate of nominees
standing for election, and recommended by the Company Board, at each such
meeting to include the Seller Nominees; (B) will nominate and reflect in the
proxy

 



     

 

 



 

statement on Schedule 14A for each such meeting the nomination of the Seller
Nominees for election as a director of the Company at each such meeting; and
(C) cause all proxies received by the Company to be voted in the manner
specified by such proxies and, to the extent permitted under applicable law
and stock exchange rules, cause all proxies for which a vote is not specified
to be voted for the Seller Nominees; and (iv) that if any Seller Nominee
ceases to be a director of the Company other than because the Holder Group
Investors, in the aggregate, cease to be a Major Investor, then the nominating
party pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ may propose to the Company a replacement
nominee for election as a director of the Company, in which event such
individual will be appointed to fill the vacancy created as a result of the
prior Seller Nominee ceasing to be a director of the Company.

 



 

(c) In addition to the Company Board nomination rights specified in _Section
3.01(a)_, as provided in Section 6.2(c) of the Preferred Stock Certificate of
Designation, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock Breach (as defined in the Preferred Stock
Certificate of Designation), a Supermajority of Holders (as defined in the
Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation), and only a Supermajority of
Holders, of the Company Preferred Stock shall have the right to designate two
individuals to fill the newly created seats on the Company Board and to
exercise the other rights contemplated by such Section 6.2. The Covered
Investors agree that one such Company Board designation right shall be vested
in Archie Bennett, Jr., during his lifetime, and the other such Company Board
designation right shall be vested in Monty J. Bennett, during his lifetime. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Covered Investor agrees that it will vote
all of such Covered Investors Company Preferred Stock, and consent to any
action by the holders of the Company Preferred Stock without a meeting as
permitted under appropriate state law, as may be directed Archie Bennett, Jr.
or Monty J. Bennett, respectively, in connection with their designation of the
individuals to fill such Company Board seats.

 



 

3.02 _Voting Rights_. The Covered Investors agree that:

 



 

(a) Each Covered Investor will cause to be present, in person or represented
by proxy, all voting securities of the Company that such Covered Investor
Beneficially Owns at all stockholder meetings of the Company so that all
voting securities of the Company that the Covered Investors Beneficially Own
will be counted for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at
such meetings.

 



 

(b) On any and all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of voting
securities of the Company (other than the matters specified in _Section
3.01(c)_), the Covered Investors will have the right to vote or direct or
cause the vote of the Sole Voting Shares as the Covered Investors determine,
in their sole discretion,

 



     

 

 



 

except as provided in this _Section 3.02(b)_. If, prior to August 8, 2023,
the combined voting power of the Reference Shares of the Company exceeds forty
percent (40.0%) (plus the combined voting power of any Company Common Stock
acquired by any Covered Investor in an arms length transaction after the date
of this Agreement from a Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company, including through open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions or any distributions of Company Common Stock by either of Ashford
Hospitality Trust, Inc. or Braemar Hotels and Resorts, Inc., to its respective
stockholders pro rata) of the combined voting power of all of the outstanding
voting securities of the Company entitled to vote on any given matter, then
Reference Shares of the Company representing voting power equal to such excess
will be deemed to be " _Company Cleansed Shares_ " under this Agreement. The
Covered Investors irrevocably agree with the Company that, with respect to the
Company Cleansed Shares, they will vote, or cause to be voted, out of the
Covered Investors Sole Voting Shares of the Company, shares constituting
voting power equal to the voting power of the Company Cleansed Shares in the
same proportion as the holders of such class or series of voting securities of
the Company vote their shares with respect to such matters, inclusive of the
Reference Shares of the Company voted by the Covered Investors (including as
hereinafter further provided in the next succeeding sentence); provided, that
the foregoing restriction may be waived by a majority of the Disinterested
Directors. The Covered Investors also irrevocably agree solely amongst
themselves that the total number of votes attributable to the Non-Cleansed
Shares will be proportionately allocated among each Covered Investor based on
a percentage, the numerator of which is the number of Reference Shares held by
such Covered Investor, and the denominator of which is the total number of
Reference Shares held by all Covered Investors in the aggregate. Each Covered
Investor hereby irrevocably grants: (i) to the Company or its designee with
respect to the voting agreement referenced in the second immediately preceding
sentence; and (ii) to each other Covered Investor or its designee with respect
to the voting agreement referenced in the immediately preceding sentence, a
proxy with full power of substitution and resubstitution, which is coupled
with an interest, during the term of this Agreement, to vote and give or
withhold consent on behalf and in the name of such Covered Investor in order
to effect the terms of _Sections 3.02(a)_ and _(b)_ , and the Company and the
Covered Investors, as applicable, each covenant to cause any such designee to
carry into effect the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Covered Investors hereby revoke any and all other proxies and voting
agreements, other than any voting agreement between Archie Bennett, Jr. and
Monty J. Bennett (which will nonetheless be subject to the terms of this
Agreement), given by the Covered Investors with respect to Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock Beneficially Owned by them and will cause
their Affiliates to revoke any and all proxies and voting agreements, other
than

 



     

 

 



 

any voting agreement between Archie Bennett, Jr. and Monty J. Bennett to which
such Affiliate is a party (but subject, nonetheless, to the terms of this
Agreement), given by any such Affiliate with respect to Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock.

 



 

3.03 _Special Protective Provisions_. Until the aggregate voting power of the
Reference Shares held by the Holder Group Investors is less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the combined voting power of all of the outstanding voting
securities of the Company on any given matter, no Holder Group Investor will
until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date: (i) take any action,
vote such Holder Group Investors securities, or enter into any transaction,
including by Acting in Concert (as defined in Annex A) with another Person,
which would result in the Company being treated as a "controlled company"
under the applicable rules of the NYSE MKT; or (ii) take any action, vote such
Holder Group Investors securities, or enter into any transaction, by Acting
in Concert (as defined in Annex A) with another Person engaging in a Rule
13e-3 Transaction, that results in the Company engaging in a Rule 13e-3
Transaction (as defined in the rules and regulations issued by the Securities
and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended); provided, that the restriction set forth in this clause (ii) may be
waived by the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Companys voting stock (taking into account the Company
Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis) that are not Beneficially Owned by
the Holder Group Investors (provided that, for purposes of clause (ii), the
Companys voting stock that is owned of record by Ashford Hospitality Trust,
Inc. or Braemar Hotels and Resorts, Inc. shall not be deemed to be Beneficially
Owned by the Holder Group Investors so long as the decision to vote such
shares on such waiver is solely determined by a majority of the members of the
Board of Directors of the applicable entity who are independent within the
meaning of applicable rules of the NYSE American (or any exchange on which the
Companys voting stock is then listed) and do not have a material financial
interest in such Rule 13e-3 Transaction (or a duly appointed board committee
consisting only of such independent and disinterested board members)).

 



 

3.04 _Authorized Capital_. The Company will at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued shares the number of shares of
Company Common Stock as may from time to time be required to comply with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Preferred Stock Certificate of
Designation.

 



 

3.05 _Reporting_. If the Company intends to take the position (on any tax
return or otherwise) that a holder of the Company Preferred Stock has received
(or is deemed for tax purposes to have received) a taxable stock distribution
(other than as a result of the receipt of common stock), the Company shall
notify each of Archie Bennett, Jr. and Monty J. Bennett (or, in either case,
his applicable designated representative, in the event of disability, or
estate, in the event of death) of such position and give each of Archie
Bennett, Jr. and Monty J. Bennett (or, in either case, his applicable
designated

 



     

 

 



 

representative, in the event of disability, or estate, in the event of death)
a reasonable opportunity to dispute such position.

 



 

3.06 _New Security Subscription Rights_. The Company will not issue any equity
securities, rights to acquire equity securities of the Company or debt
convertible into equity securities of the Company (the " _New Securities_ ")
unless the Company complies with the provisions of this _Section 3.06_,
except for: (a) the conversion of Company Preferred Stock as provided by the
Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation; and (b) the issuance of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Article 2 of this Agreement.

 



 

(a) The Company must give to each Holder Group Investor notice of its
respective intention to issue New Securities (a " _Subscription Notice_ ")
prior to accepting any offer or proposal, or making any commitment, relating
thereto and at least thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated issuance date
of the New Securities. The Subscription Notice must state the class or series
of New Securities to be issued or describe in reasonable detail the rights and
preferences of the New Securities, the aggregate number of such New Securities
to be issued, the aggregate consideration to be paid in exchange therefor, the
anticipated issuance date and the other material terms upon which the Company
proposes to issue or sell such New Securities.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of a Subscription Notice, each Holder Group Investor shall
have the right to acquire, on the terms specified in the Subscription Notice,
such Holder Group Investors Subscription Share of the New Securities
specified in the Subscription Notice. Each Holder Group Investor will be
entitled to exercise such right within the Subscription Period.

 



 

(c) To exercise the rights provided by this _Section 3.06_, a Holder Group
Investor must give a written notice of exercise (a " _Participation Notice_ ")
to the Company during the Subscription Period. The Participation Notice must
contain the irrevocable offer of such Holder Group Investor to acquire all or
any portion, of such Holder Group Investors Subscription Share of the New
Securities specified in the Subscription Notice. Failure of a Holder Group
Investor to deliver a valid Participation Notice during the Subscription
Period will be deemed a waiver of such Members subscription right with
respect to the New Securities described in the Subscription Notice. If a
subscription right is exercised in accordance with this _Section 3.06_, the
closing of the purchase of the New Securities will occur no later than the
thirtieth (30th) day after the expiration of the Subscription Period, unless
the Company and the purchasing Holder Group Investors agree upon a different
place or date.

Agreement specifying instances requiring: (a) the affirmative vote of the
majority of the stockholders of the Company that are not Affiliates or

to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof; and (C) to a
statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any
successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder and
in effect from time to time;

simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Remington
Contribution Agreement, the Hotel Services Agreement, the Non-Competition
Agreement and the Transition Cost Sharing Agreement; (b) simultaneously with
the filing for record with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of the Articles of Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (with
a delayed effective time, as specified therein); (c) simultaneously with the

 ** _Annex A_**

 



 

A Person shall be deemed to be " _Acting in Concert_ " with another Person if
such Person knowingly acts (whether or not pursuant to an express agreement,
arrangement or understanding) in concert or in parallel with such other
Person, or towards a common goal with such other Person, relating to: (a)
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of voting securities of the Company;
or (b) changing or influencing the control of the Company or in connection
with or as a participant in any transaction having that purpose or effect,
where: (i) each Person is conscious of the other Persons conduct or intent
and this awareness is an element in their decision-making processes; and (ii)
at least one additional factor indicating that such Persons intended to act in
concert or in parallel, which such additional factors may include, without
limitation, exchanging information, attending meetings, conducting
discussions, or making or soliciting invitations to act in concert or in
parallel. A Person that is Acting in Concert with another Person will also be
deemed to be Acting in Concert with any third Person that is also Acting in
Concert with such other Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person will
be deemed to be Acting in Concert with another Person solely as a result of:
(x) making or receiving a solicitation of, or granting or receiving, revocable
proxies or consents given in response to a public proxy or consent
solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act by means of a proxy or solicitation statement filed on Schedule
14A; or (y) soliciting or being solicited for, or tendering or receiving
tenders of securities in a public tender or exchange offer made pursuant to,
and in accordance with, Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act by means of a tender
offer statement filed on Schedule TO.

 



 

A Person shall be deemed the " _Beneficial Owner_ " of, shall be deemed to
have **"** _beneficial ownership_ **"** of and shall be deemed to "
_beneficially own_ " any securities:

 



 

(a) which such Person or any of such Persons Affiliates or Associates
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of
the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement;

 



 

(b) which such Person or any of such Persons Affiliates or Associates has:
(i) the right or the obligation to acquire (whether such right is exercisable,
or such obligation is required to be performed, immediately or only after the
passage of time or upon the satisfaction of conditions) pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements with
and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide
public offering of securities), written or otherwise, or upon the exercise of
conversion rights, exchange rights, rights, warrants or options, or otherwise;
provided, however, that a Person will not be deemed to be the Beneficial Owner
of, or to beneficially own: (x) securities tendered pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules
and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act by or on behalf of such
Person or any of such Persons Affiliates or Associates until such tendered

     

 

 



 

securities are accepted for purchase or exchange; (y) securities which such
Person has a right to acquire upon the exercise of rights under a shareholder
rights plan under which such rights have been distributed to all holders of
Company Common Stock, which rights have become exercisable prior to the time
that such Person becomes a Prohibited Beneficial Owner; or (z) securities
which such Person or any of such Persons Affiliates or Associates may
acquire, does or do acquire or may be deemed to have the right to acquire,
pursuant to any merger or other acquisition agreement between the Company and
such Person (or one or more of such Persons Affiliates or Associates)
pursuant to which such Person would acquire beneficial ownership of more than
fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting Company Shares without any
Transfer from a Covered Investor if such agreement has been approved by the
Board of Directors prior to such Persons becoming a Prohibited Beneficial
Owner; or (ii) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding; provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the
Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any security by reason of such
agreement, arrangement or understanding if the agreement, arrangement or
understanding to vote such security: (A) arises solely from a revocable proxy
or consent given to such Person in response to a public proxy or consent
solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules
and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (B) is not also then
reportable on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or
successor report);

 



 

(c) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other Person
(or any Affiliate or Associate of such other Person) with which such first
Person or any of such first Persons Affiliates or Associates or any other
Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of such other Person) with whom such
first Person (or any Affiliates or Associates of such first Person) is Acting
in Concert, has any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not in
writing, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any
voting securities of the Company;

 



 

(d) which are the subject of, or the reference securities for, or that
underlie, any Derivative Interest of such Person or any of such Persons
Affiliates or Associates, with the number of Company Shares deemed
Beneficially Owned being the notional or other number of Company Shares
specified in the documentation evidencing the Derivative Interest as being
subject to be acquired upon the exercise or settlement of the Derivative
Interest or as the basis upon which the value or settlement amount of such
Derivative Interest is to be calculated in whole or in part or, if no such
number of Company Shares is specified in such documentation, as determined by
the Company Board to be the number of Company Shares to which the Derivative
Interest relates;

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this definition of " _Beneficial Owner_ " to the
contrary, the phrase " _then outstanding_ ," when used with reference to a
Persons beneficial ownership of securities of the Company, means the number
of such securities then issued and outstanding together with the number of
such securities not then actually issued and

     

 

 



 

outstanding which such Person would be deemed to beneficially own hereunder
but the number of securities not outstanding that such Person is otherwise
deemed to beneficially own for purposes of this Agreement shall not be
included for the purpose of computing the percentage of the outstanding
securities beneficially owned by any other Person (unless such other Person is
also deemed to beneficially own for purposes of this Agreement such securities
not outstanding).

 



 

" _Derivative Interest_ " means any derivative securities (as defined under
Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the date of this Agreement)
that increase in value as the value of the underlying equity increases,
including, but not limited to, a long convertible security, a long call option
and a short put option position, in each case, regardless of whether: (a) such
interest conveys any voting rights in such security; (b) such interest is
required to be, or is capable of being, settled through delivery of such
security; or (c) transactions hedge the economic effect of such interest.

 



 

" _Prohibited Beneficial Owner_ " means any Person that, together with all
Affiliates and Associates of such Person, is or becomes the Beneficial Owner
of ten percent (10%) or more of the Company Common Stock then outstanding
taking the Company Preferred Stock into account on an as-converted basis, but
will not include: (a) Archie Bennett, Jr. or Monty J. Bennett; (b) any Person
which is one hundred percent (100%) Beneficially Owned by either Archie
Bennett, Jr. or Monty J. Bennett; (c) any Person that otherwise is or would
become a Prohibited Beneficial Owner as a result of an Intra-Group Transfer;
(d) any Person that otherwise is or would become a Prohibited Beneficial Owner
as a result of any voting agreement between Archie Bennett, Jr. and Monty J.
Bennett; (e) the Company; (f) any Subsidiary of the Company; (g) any employee
benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company; (h) any
entity or trustee holding (or acting in a fiduciary capacity in respect of)
Company Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such employee benefit plan
or for the purpose of funding any such plan or funding other employee benefits
for employees of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company; or (i) any
Person that, on the Closing Date, was a Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%)
or more of the Company Shares then outstanding, other than a Person that is
not an Affiliate or Associate of such Beneficial Owner on the Closing Date and
that subsequently becomes an Affiliate or Associate of such Beneficial Owner
(the Person referred to in clause (i) above, referred to herein as a "
_Grandfathered Stockholder_ "); provided, that if a Grandfathered Stockholder
becomes, after the Closing Date, the Beneficial Owner of additional Company
Shares (other than Company Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate
action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person) at
any time such that the Grandfathered Stockholder is or thereby becomes the
Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more of the Company Shares then
outstanding (or such other percentage as would otherwise result in such Person
becoming a Prohibited Beneficial Owner), then such Grandfathered Stockholder
will be deemed a Prohibited Beneficial Owner; provided, further, that upon the
first (1st) decrease of a Grandfathered Stockholders the Beneficial Ownership
below ten percent (10%), such Grandfathered Stockholder will no longer be
considered a Grandfathered Stockholder and this proviso will have no further
force or effect with respect to such Grandfathered Stockholder.

     

 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person will become a Prohibited Beneficial
Owner as the result of an acquisition of Company Shares by the Company that,
by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate
number of Company Shares Beneficially Owned by such Person to ten percent
(10%) or more of the then outstanding Company Shares (or such other percentage
as would otherwise result in such Person becoming a Prohibited Beneficial
Owner); provided, that if a Person would, but for the provisions of this
paragraph, become a Prohibited Beneficial Owner by reason of an acquisition of
Company Shares by the Company and, after such share purchases by the Company,
becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Company Shares at any time such
that the Person is or thereby becomes the Beneficial Owner of ten percent
(10%) or more of the Company Shares then outstanding (or such other percentage
as would otherwise result in such Person becoming a Prohibited Beneficial
Owner) (other than Company Shares acquired solely as a result of corporate
action of the Company not caused, directly or indirectly, by such Person),
then such Person will be deemed to be a Prohibited Beneficial Owner.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Person that would otherwise be a
Prohibited Beneficial Owner has become such inadvertently (including, without
limitation, because: (A) such Person was unaware that it Beneficially Owned
that number of Company Shares that would otherwise cause such Person to be an
"Prohibited Beneficial Owner;" or (B) such Person was aware of the extent of
its Beneficial Ownership of Company Shares but had no actual knowledge of the
consequences of such Beneficial Ownership under this Agreement) and without
any intention of obtaining, changing or influencing control of the Company,
and such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of
Company Shares so that such Person would no longer be a Prohibited Beneficial
Owner, then such Person will not be deemed to have become a Prohibited
Beneficial Owner for any purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a bona fide swaps or derivatives dealer who would otherwise be a
"Prohibited Beneficial Owner" has become so as a result of its actions in the
ordinary course of its business that were taken without the intent or effect
of evading or assisting any other Person to evade the purposes and intent of
this Agreement, or otherwise seeking to control or influence the management or
policies of the Company, then such Person shall not be deemed to be a
"Prohibited Beneficial Owner" for any purposes of this Agreement.

With respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, all shares of the Preferred Stock shall rank prior to the Corporations Common Stock and any class or series of stock of the Corporation hereafter created (collectively, the " _Junior Securities_ ").

 



 

2. _Dividends_. From and after the date of issuance of any share of Preferred Stock, dividends on such share shall be paid only if declared by the Corporations Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.

3. _Liquidation_. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (a " _Liquidation_ "), the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made to the holders of Junior Securities by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Liquidation Value (as hereinafter defined) of all of the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder. If upon any Liquidation the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock the full preferential amount to which they are entitled under this _Section 3_: (a) the holders of the shares or Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation in proportion to the respective full preferential amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the Preferred Stock in the aggregate upon such Liquidation if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock were paid in full; and (b) the Corporation shall not make or agree to make any payments to the holders of Junior Securities. For purposes of this _Section 3_, the " _Liquidation Value_ " of the Preferred Stock shall be an amount in cash equal to $0.00001 per share.

 



 

4. _Voting Rights_. The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote with the Common Stock on all matters submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for approval on the basis of one vote per share of Preferred Stock.

 



 

5. _No Preemptive Rights_.

6. _Reissuance of Preferred Stock_. Any shares of Preferred Stock redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof shall be cancelled and retired and no such shares shall thereafter be reissued, sold or transferred as Preferred Stock.

 



 

7. _Record Holders_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation may deem and treat the record holder of any share of the Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and the Corporation shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

 



 

8. _Certificates_. The shares of Preferred Stock shall be certificated and issued in registered form only. The Corporation shall keep and maintain, or shall cause to be kept and maintained, a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as the Corporation may prescribe, the Corporation shall provide for the registration of shares and transfers, exchanges or substitutions as provided herein.

 



 

9. _Transfer Restrictions and Legends_. The shares of Preferred Stock may not be reoffered, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of by a holder except pursuant to a registration statement that has become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements thereof.

 



 

10. _Transfer_. A holder may transfer a Preferred Stock certificate only upon surrender of such certificate for registration of transfer, presented at the principal executive offices of the Corporation with a written instruction in form satisfactory to the Corporation duly executed by such holder, and accompanied by certification that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Preferred Stock certificate.

 



 

11. _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. Upon receipt by the Corporation of: (i) evidence of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Preferred Stock certificate; and (ii) (y) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, indemnity (without bond or other security) reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation; or (z) in the case of mutilation, the Preferred Stock certificate (surrendered for cancellation), the Corporation shall execute and deliver a new Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and date.

distribution (or if no record date is fixed, the date as of which the record
holders of Common Stock entitled to such dividends or distributions are to be

3.3 _Partial Dividend Payments_. Except as otherwise provided in these
resolutions, if at any time the Corporation pays less than the total amount of
dividends then accrued and accumulated with respect to the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock, such payment shall be distributed pro rata among
the holders thereof based upon the aggregate accrued and accumulated but
unpaid dividends on the Shares held by each such holder.

 



 

4. _Liquidation_.

 



 

4.1 _Liquidation_. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (a " _Liquidation_ "), the
holders of Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally
available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be
made to the holders of Junior Securities by reason of their ownership thereof,
an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Liquidation Value of all Shares held
by such holder.

 



 

4.2 _Participation With Common Stock on Liquidation_. In addition to and after
payment in full of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders
of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock upon a Liquidation under _Section
4.1_, the holders of Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be entitled to participate with the holders of shares of
Common Stock then outstanding, pro rata as a single class based on the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock on an as-converted basis held by each
holder as of immediately prior to the Liquidation, in the distribution of all
the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution
to its stockholders.

 



 

4.3 _Insufficient Assets_. If upon any Liquidation the remaining assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be
insufficient to pay the holders of the Shares of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock the full preferential amount to which they are entitled under
_Section 4.1_: (a) the holders of the Shares shall share ratably in any
distribution of the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation in
proportion to the respective full preferential amounts which would otherwise
be payable in respect of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in the
aggregate upon such Liquidation if all amounts payable on or with respect to
such Shares were paid in full; and (b) the Corporation shall not make or agree
to make any payments to the holders of Junior Securities.

 



     

 

 



 

4.4 _Notice_.

 



 

(a) _Notice Requirement_. In the event of any Liquidation, the Corporation
shall, within ten (10) days of the date the Board approves such action, or no
later than twenty (20) days prior to any stockholders meeting called to
approve such action, or within twenty (20) days of the commencement of any
involuntary proceeding, whichever is earlier, give each holder of Shares of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock notice (by mail to the address of the
stockholder as reflected on Corporation records) of the proposed action. Such
notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of such proposed
action, including a description of the stock, cash and property to be received
by the holders of Shares upon consummation of the proposed action and the date
of delivery thereof. If any material change in the facts set forth in the
initial notice shall occur, the Corporation shall promptly give notice to each
holder of Shares of such material change.

 



 

(b) _Notice Waiting Period_. The Corporation shall not consummate any
voluntary Liquidation of the Corporation before the expiration of thirty (30)
days after the initial notice or ten (10) days after giving any subsequent
written notice, whichever is later; _provided_ , that any such period may be
shortened upon the written consent of the holders of all the outstanding
Shares.

 



 

5. _Conversion_.

 



 

5.1 _Right to Convert_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 5_, at any
time and from time to time on or after the Date of Issuance, any holder of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right by written election
to the Corporation to convert all or any portion of the outstanding Shares of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (including any fraction of a Share) held
by such holder along with the aggregate accrued or accumulated and unpaid
dividends thereon into an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
(including any fraction of a share) as is determined by: (i) multiplying the
number of Shares (including any fraction of a Share) to be converted by the
Liquidation Value thereof; and then (ii) dividing the result by the Preferred
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such conversion.

 



 

5.2 _Procedures for Conversion_. In order to effectuate a conversion of Shares
of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 5.1_, a holder
shall: (a) submit a written election to the Corporation that such holder
elects to convert one or more of the Shares, the number of Shares elected to
be converted; and (b) surrender, along with such written election, to the
Corporation the certificate or certificates representing the Shares being
converted, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or
accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto) or, in the event
the certificate or certificates are lost, stolen or missing, accompanied by an
affidavit of loss executed by the holder. The conversion of such Shares
hereunder shall be deemed effective as of the date of surrender of such Series
D Convertible Preferred Stock certificate or certificates or delivery of such
affidavit of loss. Upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written election
and the surrender of such certificate(s) and accompanying materials, the
Corporation shall as promptly as practicable (but in any event within twenty-
one (21) days thereafter) deliver to the relevant holder: (a) a certificate in
such holders name (or the name of such holders designee as stated in the
written election) for the number of shares of Common Stock (including any
fractional share) to which such holder shall be entitled upon conversion of
the applicable Shares as calculated pursuant to _Section 5.1_; and, if
applicable (b) a certificate in such holders name for the number of Shares of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (including any fractional share)
represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the

 



     

 

 



 

Corporation for conversion but otherwise not elected to be converted pursuant
to the written election. All shares of stock issued hereunder by the
Corporation shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
free and clear of all taxes, liens, charges and encumbrances with respect to
the issuance thereof.

 



 

5.3 _Effect of Conversion_. All shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
converted as provided in this _Section 5_ shall no longer be deemed
outstanding as of the effective time of the applicable conversion and all
rights with respect to such Shares shall immediately cease and terminate as of
such time.

 



 

5.4 _Reservation of Stock_. The Corporation shall at all times when any Shares
of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued shares of stock, solely for the
purpose of issuance upon the conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of
all outstanding Series D Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section
5_, taking into account any adjustment to such number of shares so issuable in
accordance with _Section 5.6_ hereof. The Corporation shall take all such
actions as may be necessary to assure that all such shares of Common Stock may
be so issued without violation of any applicable law or governmental
regulation. The Corporation shall not close its books against the transfer of
any of its stock in any manner which would prevent the timely conversion of
the Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.

 



 

5.5 _No Charge or Payment_. The issuance of certificates for shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
pursuant to _Section 5.1_ shall be made without payment of additional
consideration by, or other charge, cost or tax to, the holder in respect
thereof.

 



 

5.6 _Adjustment to Preferred Conversion Price and Number of Conversion
Shares_. In order to prevent dilution of the conversion rights granted under
this _Section 5_, the Preferred Conversion Price and the number of Conversion
Shares issuable on conversion of the Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this
_Section 5.6_.

 



 

(a) _Adjustment to Preferred Conversion Price and Conversion Shares Upon
Dividend, Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock_. If, other than an
Excluded Issuance, the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time
after the Date of Issuance: (i) pay a dividend or make any other distribution
upon the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation payable in shares
of Common Stock or in Options or Convertible Securities; or (ii) subdivide (by
any stock split, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a greater number of shares, then the Preferred Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to any such dividend, distribution or
subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and the number of Conversion
Shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
shall be proportionately increased. If the Corporation at any time combines
(by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Preferred Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
increased in order that the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon
conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be
proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this _Section 5.6(a)_ shall
become effective at the close of business on the date the dividend,
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Adjustment to Preferred Conversion Price and Conversion Shares Upon
Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger_. In the event of
any: (i) capital reorganization of the Corporation; (ii) reclassification of
the stock of the Corporation (other than a change in par value or from par
value to no par value or from no par value to par value or as a result of a
stock dividend or subdivision, split-up or combination of shares); (iii)
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person; (iv)
sale of all or substantially all of the Corporations assets to another
Person; or (v) other similar transaction (other than any such transaction
covered by _Section 5.6(a)_), in each case which entitles the holders of
Common Stock to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation)
stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock,
each Share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall, immediately after
such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar
transaction, remain outstanding and shall thereafter, in lieu of or in
addition to (as the case may be) the number of Conversion Shares then issuable
upon conversion of such Share, be exercisable for the kind and number of
shares of stock or other securities or assets of the Corporation or of the
successor Person resulting from such transaction to which such Share would
have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale or similar transaction if the Share had been converted in full
immediately prior to the time of such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction and acquired the applicable
number of Conversion Shares then issuable hereunder as a result of such
conversion (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the
convertibility of such Share, if any); and, in such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made with respect to such holders rights under this
Certificate of Designation to insure that the provisions of this _Section 5_
shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as possible, to the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock in relation to any shares of stock, securities or
assets thereafter acquirable upon conversion of Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock (including, in the case of any consolidation, merger, sale or similar
transaction in which the successor or purchasing Person is other than the
Corporation, an immediate adjustment in the Preferred Conversion Price to the
value per share for the Common Stock reflected by the terms of such
consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction, and a corresponding
immediate proportional adjustment to the number of Conversion Shares
acquirable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock without
regard to any limitations or restrictions on conversion, if the value so
reflected is less than the Preferred Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction). The
provisions of this _Section 5.6(b)_ shall similarly apply to successive
reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or similar
transactions. The Corporation shall not effect any such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction unless,
prior to the consummation thereof, the successor Person (if other than the
Corporation) resulting from such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction, shall assume, by written
instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of
Designation, the obligation to deliver to the holders of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock such shares of stock, securities or assets which, in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holders shall be entitled to
receive upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.

 



 

(c) _Exceptions To Adjustment Upon Issuance of Common Stock_. Anything in this
Certificate of Designation to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be no
adjustment to the Preferred Conversion Price or the number of Conversion

 



     

 

 



 

Shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
with respect to any Excluded Issuance.

 



 

(d) _Certificate as to Adjustment._

 



 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable following any adjustment of the
Preferred Conversion Ratio, but in any event not later than twenty-one (21)
days thereafter, the Corporation shall furnish to each holder of record of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at the address specified for such holder
in the books and records of the Corporation (or at such other address as may
be provided to the Corporation in writing by such holder) a certificate of an
executive officer setting forth in reasonable detail such adjustment and the
facts upon which it is based and certifying the calculation thereof.

 



 

(ii) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the
Corporation of a written request by any holder of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock, but in any event not later than twenty-one (21) days
thereafter, the Corporation shall furnish to such holder a certificate of an
executive officer certifying the Preferred Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of Conversion Shares or the amount, if any, of other shares of
stock, securities or assets then issuable to such holder upon conversion of
the Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder.

 



 

(e) _Notices_. In the event:

 



 

(i) that the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common
Stock (or other stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of
the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or
enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, to vote at a
meeting (or by written consent), to receive any right to subscribe for or
purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to
receive any other security; or

 



 

(ii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of
the Common Stock of the Corporation, any consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into another Person, or sale of all or substantially all
of the Corporations assets to another Person; or

 



 

(iii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up
of the Corporation;

 



 

then, and in each such case, the Corporation shall send or cause to be sent to
each holder of record of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at the address
specified for such holder in the books and records of the Corporation (or at
such other address as may be provided to the Corporation in writing by such
holder) at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the applicable record date or
the applicable expected effective date, as the case may be, for the event, a
written notice specifying, as the case may be: (A) the record date for such
dividend, distribution, meeting or consent or other right or action, and a
description of such dividend, distribution or other right or action to be
taken at such meeting or by written consent; or (B) the effective date on
which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the
date, if any is to be fixed, as of which the books of the Corporation shall
close or a record shall be taken with respect to which the holders of record
of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities

 



     

 

 



 

at the time issuable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such
other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon
such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character
of such exchange applicable to the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and
the Conversion Shares.

 



 

6. _Breach of Obligations_.

 



 

6.1 _Series D Convertible Preferred Stock Breach_. In addition to any other
rights which a holder of Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is
entitled under any other contract or agreement and any other rights such
holder may have pursuant to applicable law, the holders of Shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the rights and remedies set forth in
_Section 6.2_ in the event the Corporation fails to pay in cash any dividend
on a Dividend Payment Date pursuant to _Section 3.1_, whether or not such
payment is declared by the Board or is legally permissible or is otherwise
prohibited, for two (2) consecutive quarterly periods (a " _Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock Breach_"); _provided_ , that a Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock Breach will not be deemed to have occurred in the
event that the failure to pay in cash any dividend on a Dividend Payment Date
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ was substantially caused by any action or omission
on the part of any holder of Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in
such holders capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation.

 



 

6.2 _Consequences of Breach_. If a Series D Convertible Preferred Stock Breach
has occurred and is continuing, then, in addition to any rights provided in
the Investor Rights Agreement, until such arrearage is paid in cash in full
(at which time the rights hereunder shall terminate, subject to revesting in
the event of each and every subsequent Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
Breach):

 



 

(a) _Increased Dividend Rate_. The dividend rate on the Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock set forth in Section 3.1 hereof shall increase immediately to
10.00% per annum until no Series D Convertible Preferred Stock Breach exists.

 



 

(b) _No Dividends on Common Stock_. No dividends may be declared and paid, or
any other distributions or redemptions may be made, on the Common Stock.

 



 

(c) _Additional Board Designation Rights_. The number of directors
constituting the Board shall be increased by two (2) Board seats (and the
Corporation shall take all necessary action under its organizational
documents, including its bylaws, to effectuate such increase and the other
rights hereunder). A Supermajority of Holders, and only a Supermajority of
Holders, will be entitled to designate the individuals to fill such newly
created Board seats, to fill any vacancy in such Board seats and to remove and
replace any individuals designated to fill such Board seats. Such additional
directors shall have all voting and other rights (including for purposes of
determining the existence of a quorum) as the other individuals serving on the
Board. Upon the termination of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
Breach, the term of office on the Board of all individuals who may have been
designated as directors hereunder shall cease (and such individuals shall
promptly resign from the Board), and the number of directors constituting the
Board shall return to the number of directors that constituted the entire
Board immediately prior to the occurrence or existence of the initial Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock Breach giving rise to the foregoing rights.

 



      

 

 



 

7. _Voting Rights and Protective Provisions._

 



 

7.1 _General_. The holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to vote with the Common Stock on all matters submitted to the
stockholders of the Corporation for approval with the number of votes
attributable to each Share being determined on an as-converted basis assuming
all Shares had been converted pursuant to _Section 5_ as of immediately prior
to the date as of which the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote on any
such matter are to be determined. The holders of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock shall also have the voting rights as provided in _Section
7.2_ and _Section 7.3_.

 



 

7.2 _Series D Convertible Preferred Stock Directors_. When a Series D

without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided
by the NRS) of the holders of at least 55% (" _Supermajority of Holders_ ") of
the shares of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at the time
outstanding:

 



 

(a) amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Designation or
the Charter (including any amendment, alteration or repeal by means of a
merger, consolidation or otherwise) so as to modify in any way the terms,
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock;

 



 

(b) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of any stock of the

(together with a corresponding dividend payable to the holders of the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2_); or

 



 

(g) enter into (or suffer to exist) any agreement, commitment, understanding
or other arrangement to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



     

 

 



 

8. _Preferred Call Option_.

 



 

8.1 The Corporation has an option to require each holder of Shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock to sell to the Corporation, and such holder is
obligated to sell to the Corporation (the " _Preferred Call Option_ "), all or
any portion of the Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock then owned
by such holder on a pro rata basis among all such holders (except that the
Preferred Call Option will not be exercised with respect to Shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock with an aggregate purchase price less than
$25,000,000). In the event that the Corporation elects to exercise the
Preferred Call Option, then such exercise shall be directed to all holders
then owning Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on a pro rata
basis. The Preferred Call Option may be exercised by the Corporation only
after June 30, 2026; provided, that, in the event the Corporation exercises
the Preferred Call Option, each holder of Shares of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock may, by written notice delivered to the Corporation not fewer
than five (5) Business Days before the scheduled Call Option Closing, exercise
such holders right to convert the Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock into Common Stock. In the event that the Corporation exercises the
Preferred Call Option, the price to be paid to each holder of Series D

cash in an amount equal to the Preferred Stock Cash Amount.

 



 

8.2 The Preferred Call Option may be exercised by the Corporation giving

8.3 The closing for the purchase and sale pursuant to the Preferred Call
Option will take place at the executive offices of the Corporation on the date
specified in the Corporations notice of its exercise of the Preferred Call
Option (a " _Call Option Closing_ "); provided, that the date of the closing
of such purchase and sale will take place no fewer than thirty (30) nor more
than sixty (60) days after the date of such notice. At any Call Option
Closing, each holder then owning Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock will deliver good and marketable title to the Shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock being purchased and sold, duly endorsed in blank
and otherwise in good form for transfer (if applicable), free and clear of any
lien, charge, claim, or encumbrance other than this Certificate of
Designation. In consideration for the same, the Corporation will deliver the
consideration set forth in _Section 8.1_.

 



 

8.4 Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 8.1_, upon written notice
delivered to the Corporation not fewer than five (5) Business Days prior to
the scheduled Call Option Closing, the holders of Shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock participating in such notice shall be entitled to
specify that the number of Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
subject to the Call Option (as determined on a pro rata basis) that are held
by such notifying holders shall instead be allocated among such notifying
holders on the basis (other than pro rata) specified in such written notice.
The Corporation shall comply with such written direction in connection with
the consummation of the Preferred Call Option at the scheduled Call Option
Closing provided that the Corporation is able to purchase, in the aggregate,
the number of Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock specified in the
Corporations notice of its exercise of the Preferred Call Option.

 



 

9. _No Preemptive Rights_. No holder of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase, or have any preemptive right or any other right to remediate dilution with respect to, any part of any new or additional issue of stock of any class whatsoever or of securities convertible into any stock of any class whatsoever, whether now or hereafter authorized and whether issued for cash or other consideration or by way of dividend. Nothing herein, however,

 



     

 

 



 

shall prohibit the Corporation from granting one or more holders of the Shares
the right to participate in offerings of additional securities of the
Corporation.

 



 

10. _Reissuance of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock_. Any Shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock redeemed, converted or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any Subsidiary shall be cancelled and retired as authorized and issued shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation and no such Shares shall thereafter be reissued, sold or transferred as Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.

 



 

11. _Record Holders_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation (and any Transfer Agent for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock) may deem and treat the record holder of any share of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and the Corporation (and any such Transfer Agent) shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

 



 

12. _Certificates_. Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be certificated and issued in registered form only. The Corporation shall keep and maintain, or shall cause to be kept and maintained, a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as the Corporation may prescribe, the Corporation shall provide for the registration of shares and transfers, exchanges or substitutions as provided herein.

However, the Corporation shall not be obligated to reissue such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Preferred Stock Certificate(s) if the holder contemporaneously requests the Corporation to convert such Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.

 



 

17. _Waiver_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Certificate of Designation to the contrary, any provision contained herein and any right of the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock granted hereunder may be waived as to all shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (and the holders thereof) upon the written consent of a Supermajority of Holders, unless a higher percentage is required by applicable law, in

 



     

 

 



 

which case the written consent of the holders of not less than such higher
percentage of shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be
required.

 



 

18. _Notices_.

1. _Introduction_. As part of the consideration for entering into this Agreement, and effective simultaneously herewith, AB and certain of his affiliates have entered into a substantially similar voting agreement with respect to the Stock owned or held of record or beneficially by him and such affiliates, which names AB as the initial voting representative, and MB as the successor voting representative, under and pursuant to such agreement (the " _Additional Voting Agreement_ ").

 



 

Each Stockholder owns or holds, legally or beneficially, directly or
indirectly, of record or otherwise, the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Stock specified beside its name on the signature pages of this
Agreement.

 



 

As provided above, but not by way of limitation, any additional shares of
Stock or other voting securities (of New Holdco or any successor entity
thereto) which may be owned, held or

 



     

 

 



 

acquired in any manner, legally or beneficially, directly or indirectly, of
record or otherwise, by any Stockholder at any time during the term of this
Agreement, whether or not issued incident to any stock split, stock dividend,
increase in capitalization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other
reorganization or like transaction, shall be included within the term "Stock"
as used herein, and shall be subject to this Agreement.

 



 

It is the intent and purpose of each Stockholder to enter into this Agreement
in order to vest solely and irrevocably in the Voting Representative the power
to direct each such Stockholder how to vote such Stockholders Stock in the
election and/or designation of directors of New Holdco and with respect to any
and all other matters submitted to a vote of or the consent by the
stockholders of New Holdco, including without limitation any vote, consent or
designation right that may only be applicable to or vested in the holders of
the New Holdco Preferred Stock, and to these ends, and for other appropriate
purposes, each Stockholder desires and intends to, and does hereby,
irrevocably vest such power solely in the Voting Representative, as
hereinafter provided.

 



 

2. _Consideration_. In order to accomplish the purposes set forth in Paragraph 1, and to effectuate the intentions described therein, and in consideration of and in reliance on the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and the Additional Voting Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by each Stockholder, the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting Representative hereby irrevocably make and enter into this Agreement.

 



 

3. _Joint Action_. During the term of this Agreement, all shares of the Stock shall be voted by each Stockholder as directed by the Voting Representative on all matters as to which

 



     

 

 



 

each Stockholder shall be entitled to vote or consent, pursuant to the
following terms and conditions:

 



 

3.1. _Rights of Voting Representatives_. Each Stockholder, by execution of
this Agreement, subject to that certain Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of
[*], 20[*] by and among by and among New Holdco, AB, MB, MJB Investments, the
Trust, the Alayna Jo Bennett Max 2019 Gift Trust, the Archie Bennett, III 2019
Gift Trust, the Audra Marie Bennett Maxwell 2019 Gift Trust, the Jory Glazener
2019 Gift Trust, the Krista Koleas 2019 Gift Trust, the Matthew Wade Bennett
2019 Gift Trust, and the Beverly Rene Bennett Flood 2019 Gift Trust, James L.
Cowen, Jeremy J. Welter and Mark A. Sharkey (the " _Investor Rights Agreement_
"), irrevocably agrees that such Stockholder will vote all of such
Stockholders Stock at any and all regular and special meetings of
stockholders of New Holdco whenever and wherever held during the term of this
Agreement, or at any adjournment thereof, and consent to any action by the
stockholders of New Holdco without a meeting as permitted under appropriate
state law, as may be directed by the Voting Representative. Each Stockholder
agrees that the foregoing grant of authority to the Voting Representative
shall include without limitation the right to direct such Stockholder how to
vote or consent, or to exercise any designation rights, that may only be
applicable to or vested in the holders of the New Holdco Preferred Stock.
Except as set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement, each Stockholder hereby
terminates, revokes and rescinds any and all proxies, rights, agreements or
arrangements, written or verbal, previously entered into or given with respect
to any shares of Stock, including without limitation under and pursuant to the
Prior Voting Agreement (as hereinafter defined). The Voting Representative
shall have the right to direct the voting of the Stock with respect to any
corporate or stockholder action of any kind.

 



     

 

 



 

By execution of this Agreement, each Stockholder expressly agrees, as may be
directed by the Voting Representative, to participate in the call of special
meetings of stockholders of New Holdco for any purpose or purposes which the
Voting Representative shall in its sole discretion deem necessary and
appropriate.

 



 

In directing the voting of the Stock at a meeting (or consenting to corporate
or stockholder action in lieu of a meeting), subject to the Investor Rights
Agreement, the Voting Representative shall exercise its sole judgment in
selecting the directors for New Holdco for which such Stock shall be voted (or
consented to with respect to corporate or other stockholder action in lieu of
a meeting), and shall otherwise be entitled to direct the voting of such Stock
(or the consenting to corporate or other action in lieu of a meeting) with
respect to the management of New Holdcos affairs as the Voting Representative
may deem necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion.

 



 

The Stock shall be voted, the consent to corporate or stockholder action shall
be taken, and all other actions required of the Voting Representative by the
terms of this Agreement shall be undertaken, subject to the Investor Rights
Agreement, in the manner determined and directed by the Voting Representative
in its sole discretion, who shall have the authority to exercise all the
rights and powers granted hereunder, which exercise may be in person, by
telephone, by written direction, including by means of electronic
communications.

 



 

If the agreement set forth in this Paragraph 3.1 is determined to be invalid
for any reason, each Stockholder agrees to promptly execute, on an individual
basis, a new agreement naming the Voting Representative and granting it the
powers contemplated by this Paragraph 3.1 and containing substantially similar
material terms in order to effect the purpose of this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

3.2. _Liability of Voting Representative_. The Voting Representative shall not
be personally or otherwise liable with respect to any action taken or omitted
to be taken under this Agreement, provided such commission or omission does
not amount to its willful violation of applicable law. Each Stockholder agrees
to indemnify and hold the Voting Representative and its successors harmless
from any liability or cost resulting from any action or failure to act as
Voting Representative pursuant to this Agreement, provided such action or
failure to act does not amount to its willful violation of applicable law.

 



 

3.3. _Successor Voting Representatives_. In order to have a Voting
Representative under this Agreement at all times, any vacancies shall be
filled according to the following provisions of this Paragraph 3.3.

 



 

3.3.1. _Successor Voting Representatives_. In the event of the resignation,
death or Incapacity of MB, in his capacity as the initial Voting
Representative under and pursuant to this Agreement, or if, for any reason, he
fails or ceases to serve as the Voting Representative under and pursuant to
this Agreement, then AB, in his capacity as the initial Successor Voting
Representative under and pursuant to this Agreement, shall be deemed to have
been automatically and irrevocably appointed as the Successor Voting
Representative by each Stockholder without any further action on the part of
the Stockholder being necessary under this Agreement. In the event of the
resignation, death or Incapacity of AB, in his capacity as the initial
Successor Voting Representative under and pursuant to this Agreement, or if,
for any reason, he fails or ceases to serve as such under and pursuant to this
Agreement, then, at that time, and at all times thereafter the Stockholders
representing a majority of the shares of Stock shall appoint, by written
instrument delivered to all of the Stockholders and any other stockholders who
become parties to this Agreement, a subsequent successor to the initial

 



     

 

 



 

Successor Voting Representative to serve as such under and pursuant to this
Agreement. The initial Successor Voting Representative, as well as any
subsequent successor to the initial Successor Voting Representative, in each
case as named and appointed in accordance with this Paragraph 3.3.1, shall
have all the rights, powers, privileges and authority granted to the initial
Voting Representative or the initial Successor Voting Representative, as
applicable, under this Agreement and any amendment hereof or supplement hereto
and, following any such appointment, shall be deemed the " _Voting
Representative_ " or " _Successor Voting Representative_ ", as applicable, for
all purposes under and pursuant to this Agreement. For further purposes under
and pursuant to this Agreement, " _Incapacity_ " shall mean any material
physical, mental or other disability of the applicable person rendering the
person incapable of substantially performing his duties and services hereunder
that is not cured within 180 days of the first occurrence of such incapacity
as determined by the Stockholders representing a majority of the shares of
Stock.

 



 

3.4. _Compensation of Voting Representative_. The Voting Representative shall
not be compensated in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

4. _Transfers of Stock; Right of First Offer; Additional Stockholders_.

 



 

4.1. _Definitions Applicable to Paragraph 4_. For purposes of Paragraph 4: (i)
" _Transfer_ " and its correlative terms mean any sale, assignment, pledge,
hypothecation, transfer, gift or other disposition or encumbrance of any
shares of Stock, or any beneficial interest therein, but does not include a
bona fide pledge of shares of Stock in an arms-length lending transaction
with a person or entity that is not an Affiliate of the pledgor of such shares
of Stock; (ii) " _Affiliate_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in
Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934,

 



     

 

 



 

as amended; (iii) " _Controlled Affiliate_ " means an Affiliate that, directly
or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, is controlled by a
Stockholder, and "controlled by" means the possession, directly or indirectly,
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies
of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities or by contract
or otherwise; and (iv) " _Intra-Group Transfer_ " shall have the meaning
ascribed to such term in the Investor Rights Agreement.

 



 

4.2. _Notice of Transfers_. Each Stockholder (including, without limitation,
the estate of such Stockholder) that proposes a Transfer of all or any part of
such Stockholders shares of Stock (the " _Notifying Stockholder_ ") shall be
required to provide advance written notice of such Transfer to each of AB, the
Voting Representative and the Successor Voting Representative, which written
notice shall specify the terms of the proposed Transfer (including the number
of shares of Stock proposed to be Transferred, the proposed per share sale
price of and/or the other economic terms relating to the Transfer of such
shares, and the identity of the proposed transferee of such shares) and
whether or not such Transfer is an Intra-Group Transfer (any such written
notice, a " _Transfer Notice_ "). In the event that such Transfer is an Intra-
Group Transfer, then the provisions of Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.6 shall also apply
to such Transfer in addition to any other applicable provisions of this
Agreement. In the event that such Transfer is not an Intra-Group Transfer,
then the provisions of Paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5 shall also apply to such
Transfer in addition to any other applicable provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

4.3. _Intra-Group Transfers_. No shares of Stock may be Transferred by any
Stockholder (including, without limitation, by the estate of such Stockholder)
to any other person or entity in a transaction that constitutes an Intra-Group
Transfer unless such other

 



     

 

 



 

person or entity, prior to such Transfer, agrees in writing by execution and
delivery to each of AB, the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting
Representative of a counterpart of this Agreement or similar instrument, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of AB, the Voting
Representative and the Successor Voting Representative, to become subject to
all the terms and conditions hereof as to the shares of Stock made subject
hereto and be considered a " _Stockholder_ " holding " _Stock_ " hereunder for
all purposes hereunder.

 



 

4.4. _Non-Intra-Group Transfers_. Subject to compliance with the provisions of
Paragraph 4.5, any shares of Stock Transferred by a Notifying Stockholder in a
transaction that does not constitute an Intra-Group Transfer shall, upon
consummation of such Transfer, no longer be subject to the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

4.5. _Right of First Offer_. In the event that a Transfer Notice states that
the Notifying Stockholder proposes to Transfer shares of Stock in a
transaction that does not constitute an Intra-Group Transfer, then, not later
than 5:00pm Central Time on the 30th calendar day following date on which such
Transfer Notice is deemed delivered to each of AB, the Voting Representative
and the Successor Voting Representative (such 30 calendar day period, the "
_Election Period_ "), AB (or ABs designee specified in writing to the
Notifying Shareholder (any such designee, " _AB s Designee_")), individually
and not as the Successor Voting Representative, shall be entitled to provide
written notice (any such notice, the " _Election Notice_ ") to each of the
Notifying Stockholder, the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting
Representative that AB (or, if applicable, ABs Designee) is electing to
purchase all or a portion (as specified in the Election Notice) of the shares
of Stock covered by the Transfer Notice at the same per share price and on the

 



     

 

 



 

other economic terms set forth in the Transfer Notice. Thereafter, and not
later than 5:00pm Central Time on the 60th calendar day following the date on
which such Election Notice is deemed delivered to each of the Notifying
Stockholder, the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting Representative
(or the first business day on which national banks in Dallas, Texas are open
for the transaction of business in the event that such 60th calendar day is
not such a business day), the Notifying Stockholder shall sell to AB (or, if
applicable, ABs Designee), and AB (or, if applicable, ABs Designee) shall
purchase from the Notifying Stockholder, the number of shares of Stock
specified in the Election Notice (which shares shall be sold by the Notifying
Stockholder pursuant to customary share transfer documentation and shall be
free and clear of any liens, security interests, pledges, mortgages or similar
encumbrances) in exchange for the payment by AB (or, if applicable, ABs
Designee) to the Notifying Stockholder of the per share purchase price and on
the other economic terms specified in the Transfer Notice applicable to the
shares so purchased and sold. Any such shares so purchased by AB (or, if
applicable, ABs Designee) pursuant to this Paragraph 4.5 shall, upon the
consummation of such purchase, no longer be subject to the terms of this
Agreement, but such shares may become subject, if applicable, to the terms of
the Additional Voting Agreement. In the event that AB (or, if applicable, ABs
Designee) does not exercise the right to purchase any shares of Stock covered
by the Transfer Notice pursuant to this Paragraph 4.5, then the Notifying
Stockholder shall be permitted to effect the Transfer proposed in the Transfer
Notice, on terms at least equal to 90% of the per share purchase price and the
other economic terms specified in the Transfer Notice, during the 60 calendar
day period following the expiration of the Election Period. If, at the end of
such

 



     

 

 



 

60 calendar day period, any shares of Stock covered by the Transfer Notice
shall not have been so Transferred by the Notifying Stockholder, then such
shares shall once again remain subject to the provisions of Paragraph 4.

 



 

4.6. _Counterpart Agreement_. A copy of any counterpart agreement or similar
instrument contemplated by Paragraph 4.3 shall be maintained on file with the
secretary of New Holdco and shall include the address of such persons or
entities to whom notices hereunder shall be sent. Any new certificates
representing any such shares of Stock Transferred in accordance with Paragraph
4.3 shall bear the legend set forth in Paragraph 6.1.

 



 

4.7. _Controlled Affiliates_. If, at any time during the term of this
Agreement, any additional shares of Stock or other voting securities of New
Holdco that are owned, held or acquired in any manner, legally or
beneficially, directly or indirectly, of record or otherwise, by any
Controlled Affiliate of a Stockholder that is not a party to this Agreement,
then such Stockholder agrees to cause each such Controlled Affiliate to join
in this Agreement and subject all Stock owned, held or acquired by such
Controlled Affiliate to the provisions hereof, by execution and delivery to
the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting Representative of a
counterpart of this Agreement or similar instrument, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting
Representative. Each such Controlled Affiliate, by his, her or its signature
to a counterpart of this Agreement or similar instrument, shall become subject
to all the terms and conditions hereof as to the shares of Stock made subject
hereto and be considered a " _Stockholder_ " holding " _Stock_ " for all
purposes hereunder.

 



      

 

 



 

5. _Deposit of Counterparts of Agreement_. A counterpart of this Agreement shall be filed with the registered office of New Holdco and with the secretary of New Holdco at New Holdcos executive offices.

 



 

6. _Legend_.

 



 

6.1. _Legend on Certificates_. All certificates (including shares maintained
in uncertificated form maintained in any book-entry system) representing
shares of Stock shall bear (or have notated electronically within any book-
entry system and contained in the statement of information required by Nevada
Revised Statutes 78.235) the following legend:

 



 

The shares represented by this certificate are subject to the provisions of a
Voting and Stock Transfer Restriction Agreement, dated as of [*], 20[*] (the "
_Agreement_ "), a counterpart of which has been filed with the registered
office of Ashford Nevada Holding Corp. (to be renamed Ashford Inc.) (" _New
Holdco_ ") in the State of Nevada. New Holdco will furnish a copy of the
Agreement to the holder of this certificate without charge upon written
request to the New Holdco at its business office. The Agreement vests the
power to direct the voting rights with respect to the shares represented by
this certificate in a designated Voting Representative.

 



 

6.2. _Responsibility to Affix Legend_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, unless a later date is specified by written notice to each
Stockholder by the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting
Representative, each Stockholder shall deliver to the Voting Representative
and the Successor Voting Representative, or such other person as may be
designated by the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting
Representative in such written notice, all of the certificates representing
such Stockholders respective shares of Stock. The Voting Representative and
the Successor Voting Representative or their joint designee shall affix the
legend referenced in Paragraph 6.1 conspicuously on each certificate and
promptly return the certificates to the applicable Stockholder. In the case of
uncertificated shares of Stock, the Voting Representative and the Successor
Voting Representative shall take reasonable efforts

 



     

 

 



 

to cause New Holdco to make an appropriate notation in the respective book-
entry accounts for the Stock (as provided in Paragraph 6.1), and to include
the legend in all notices, statements and other similar correspondence sent to
the holders of uncertificated Stock. Certificates representing subsequently
acquired shares of Stock subject to this Agreement, within ten days after
acquisition of such shares of Stock, shall be submitted in the same manner for
affixing the legend. Each Stockholder shall make arrangements for affixation
of the legend to any certificates representing any such shares of Stock that
it does not have in its personal possession and therefore cannot deliver
pursuant to this Paragraph 6.2. Each Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold
the Voting Representative, the Successor Voting Representative and each of
their respective successors or assigns harmless from any loss, damage or cost
suffered by such persons as a result of any failure to deliver, or cause to be
delivered, certificates representing shares of Stock for affixation of the
legend in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph 6.2. Certificates
representing any shares of Stock released from the applicable provisions of
this Agreement must be presented to the Voting Representative and the
Successor Voting Representative for removal of the legend.

 



 

7. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere herein, this Agreement shall remain effective for a term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the first date that neither MB nor AB are then living, at which point this Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect; provided, however, that Paragraph 3 shall terminate on the 15th anniversary of the Effective Date unless extended as provided in Nevada Revised Statutes 78.365.

 



     

 

 



 

8. _General_.

 



 

8.1. _Notices_. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed given

Representative and/or the Stockholder to whom it is directed, or when
deposited in the United States mail, certified, return receipt requested, with
postage prepaid, addressed to the Voting Representative, the Successor Voting
Representative and/or such Stockholder at the address specified beside his,
her or its name on the signature pages of this Agreement. An address may be
changed by written notice to each of the Voting Representative, the Successor
Voting Representative and/or each Stockholder in the manner provided in this
Paragraph 8.1.

 



 

8.2. _Effect of Agreement_. This Agreement shall be binding on and enforceable
against the Voting Representative, the Successor Voting Representative and
each Stockholder, as well as his, her or its estate, heirs, administrators,
executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and on all
subsequent owners of any shares of the Stock (unless otherwise provided in
this Agreement), who shall be deemed " _Stockholders_ " within the meaning of,
and shall hold such shares subject to, this Agreement. Except for New Holdco,
which shall be deemed an express third-party beneficiary hereof, and Archie
Bennett, Jr., individually and not as the Successor Voting Representative, as
to the provisions of Paragraph 4.5, no other person(s) shall have or be
construed to have any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of or by virtue of this Agreement or any provision herein contained.

 



 

8.3. _Severability_. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge to be
invalid any clause, sentence, subparagraph, paragraph or section of this
Agreement, such judgment or decree shall not affect, impair, invalidate or
nullify the remainder of this Agreement,

 



     

 

 



 

but the effect thereof shall be confined to the clause, sentence,
subparagraph, paragraph or section so adjudged to be invalid.

 



 

8.4. _Amendment of Agreement_. Except to the extent related to the addition of
a new " _Stockholder_ " pursuant to the applicable provisions of this this
Agreement, this Agreement may be changed, modified or amended only by a
written instrument signed by each Stockholder, the Voting Representative and
the Successor Voting Representative. Any such amendment shall become effective
as of the date specified in the written instrument or, if no date is
specified, on the date the Voting Representative receives the written
instrument containing the amendment from each Stockholder.

 



 

8.5. _Execution of Other Instruments_. Each Stockholder shall, subject to the
Investor Rights Agreement, execute and deliver such other agreements and
instruments as the Voting Representative and the Successor Voting
Representative from time to time may deem advisable or appropriate to
effectuate the intent and purpose of this Agreement, including, but not by way
of limitation, the execution and delivery of a supplemental or additional
agreement or agreements regarding the rights and powers granted under this
Agreement with respect to the voting of all of the shares of Stock, but the
delivery of any such supplemental or additional agreement or agreements shall
in no way affect the validity of the agreements set forth in Paragraph 3.1.

 



 

8.6. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

8.6.1. _Paragraph and Subparagraph Headings_. The paragraph and subparagraph
headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

8.6.2. _Numbers and Gender_. When required by the context, each number
(singular and plural) shall include all numbers and each gender shall include
all genders.

 



 

8.6.3. **_Choice of Law_** **. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada.**

 



 

8.6.4. _Specific Performance; Breach_. Each Stockholder, the Voting
Representative and the Successor Voting Representative acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that a non-
breaching party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement by the breaching party in addition to any other remedy to which the
non-breaching party is entitled at law or in equity without the need to
demonstrate irreparable harm or to post any bond or surety. The parties to
this Agreement also acknowledge and agree that the breach of this Agreement
would result in substantial damage but that the amount of such damage would be
extremely difficult or impractical to determine. Therefore, if legal action is
commenced to enforce this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled
to recover from the breaching party the non-breaching partys costs and
reasonable attorneys fees plus an amount equal to $500,000, which amount is
not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in an amount reasonably estimated
by the parties to this Agreement to compensate a non-breaching party for its
damages, including the efforts and resources expended in negotiating this
Agreement and its reliance on the expectation that all parties hereto would
fully comply with the provisions hereof.

 



 

8.6.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, via facsimile, email or other means of electronic transmission,
each of which when

 



     

 

 



 

so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

8.6.6. _Person_. The word " _person_ " in this Agreement shall mean an
individual, corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
partnership, limited liability company, professional corporation, trust,
estate, custodian, trustee, executor, administrator, nominee, charity or other
entity in its own or a representative capacity.

 



 

8.6.7. _Nevada_. This Agreement is intended to be an agreement between two or
more stockholders as described in Nevada Revised Statutes 78.365 and a
restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares as described
in Nevada Revised Statutes 78.242, as applicable, and shall be governed and
interpreted in accordance with such provisions.

 



 

8.6.8. _Termination of Prior Voting and Stock Transfer Restriction Agreement_.
The parties hereto agree that this Agreement supersedes and replaces in all
respects that certain Voting and Stock Transfer Restriction Agreement (the "
_Prior Voting Agreement_ "), dated as of August 8, 2018, among AB, MB and
certain of the Stockholders, which Prior Voting Agreement shall be deemed
terminated and of no further force or effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

8.6.9. _Timing_. The parties hereto acknowledge that this Agreement was
executed simultaneously with the execution of the Investor Rights Agreement.

have any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of or
by virtue of this Agreement or any provision herein contained.

 



 

8.3. _Severability_. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge to be
invalid any clause, sentence, subparagraph, paragraph or section of this

nullify the remainder of this Agreement, but the effect thereof shall be
confined to the clause, sentence, subparagraph, paragraph or section so
adjudged to be invalid.

 



 

8.4. _Amendment of Agreement_. Except to the extent related to the addition of
a new " _Stockholder_ " pursuant to the applicable provisions of this this

Representative. Any such amendment shall become effective as of the date
specified in the written instrument or, if no date is specified, on the date
the Voting Representative receives the written instrument containing the

of limitation, the execution and delivery of a supplemental or additional
agreement or agreements regarding the rights and powers granted under this
Agreement with respect to the voting of all of the shares of Stock, but the

Agreement by the breaching party in addition to any other remedy to which the
non-breaching party is entitled at law or in equity without the need to
demonstrate irreparable harm or to post any bond or surety. The parties to
this Agreement also acknowledge and agree that the breach of this Agreement
would result in substantial damage but that the amount of such damage would be

commenced to enforce this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled
to recover from the breaching party the non-breaching partys costs and
reasonable attorneys fees plus an amount equal to $500,000, which amount is
not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in an amount reasonably estimated
by the parties to this Agreement to compensate a non-breaching party for its
damages, including the efforts and resources expended in negotiating this
Agreement and its reliance on the expectation that all parties hereto would
fully comply with the provisions hereof.

more stockholders as described in Nevada Revised Statutes 78.365 and a
restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares as described
in Nevada Revised Statutes 78.242, as applicable, and shall be governed and
interpreted in accordance with such provisions.

respects that certain Voting and Stock Transfer Restriction Agreement (the "

terminated and of no further force or effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 **WHEREAS,** the purpose of the Merger is, in part, to cause the holding

Agreement and the Combination Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** under the Combination Agreement, the following AINC stockholder

the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (i) the affirmative vote of
a majority of the issued and outstanding voting power of the AINC voting stock
(taking into account the Existing AINC Preferred Stock on an as-converted
basis), (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 55% of the
outstanding shares of the Existing AINC Preferred Stock, and (iii) the
affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AINC
voting stock (taking into account the Existing AINC Preferred Stock on an as-

defined below); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS, it** is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and,
where applicable, state and local tax purposes): (i) the Merger shall qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ " _),_ and this Agreement
together with the Combination Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder; and (ii) the exchange of Transferred Securities (as
defined in the Combination Agreement) for New Holdco Preferred Stock pursuant
to the Remington

Combination Agreement (the " _ _Remington Exchange__ "), together with the
exchange of Existing AINC Common Stock for New Holdco Common Stock and the
Existing AINC Preferred Stock for New Holdco Preferred Stock pursuant to the
Merger, qualify as an exchange under Section 351 of the Code, and the
Combination Agreement, the PM Contribution Agreement and this Agreement will
together be taken as a single plan of exchange under Section 351 of the Code.

objection to the Merger within the time required by the MGCL, (ii) has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented to it in writing, and (ii) has made
a written demand on New Holdco for the payment of the fair value such holders
Existing AINC Preferred Stock and has complied in all respects with, the MGCL
(collectively, the " _ _Dissenting Shares__ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the New Holdco Preferred Stock in accordance with Section
1.8(b). At the Effective Time, (i) all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and
cease to exist and (ii) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as may be granted to them under the MGCL.

 



 

(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.9(A), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holders shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the New Holdco Preferred Stock in accordance
with Section 1.8(B).

 



 

(C) AINC shall give New Holdco (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal of any shares of Existing AINC Preferred Stock (including copies of
any written demands), any withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instrument served on AINC under the MGCL and (ii) the right to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for

offer to make or make any payment with respect to any such demands for

delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(D) Prior to the Effective Time, AINC shall not, except with the prior written
consent of New Holdco, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Existing AINC Preferred Stock, offer to

 



     

 

 



 

settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 



 

Section 1.10 _No Required Surrender of Stock Certificates_.

 



 

(A) Excluding any Dissenting Shares, at and after the Effective Time: (i)
where no physical certificate representing the shares of Existing AINC Common
Stock or Existing AINC Preferred Stock has been issued in the name of a holder
of shares of Existing AINC Common Stock or Existing AINC Preferred Stock, as
applicable, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
"book-entry" _(i.e.,_ a computerized or manual entry) shall be made in the
stockholder records of New Holdco to evidence the issuance to such holder of
the number of uncertificated shares of New Holdco Common Stock or New Holdco
Preferred Stock into which such shares of Existing AINC Common Stock or
Existing AINC Preferred Stock, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to
Section 1.8 and New Holdco shall cause each stockholder holding New Holdco
Common Stock or New Holdco Preferred Stock, as applicable, in book entry form
to be provided such information as shall be required by or necessary to comply
with Nevada law; and (ii) each certificate which, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Existing AINC Common Stock
or Existing AINC Preferred Stock, as applicable (an " _ _AINC Certificate__
"), shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership of, and to
represent, the number of shares of New Holdco Common Stock or New Holdco
Preferred Stock, as applicable, into which the shares of Existing AINC Common
Stock or Existing AINC Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such
AINC Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time have been converted
pursuant to Section 1.8.

 



 

(B) Excluding any Dissenting Shares, the registered holder of any AINC
Certificate outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, as such
holder appears in the books and records of AINC, or of the transfer agent in
respect of the shares of Existing AINC Common Stock or Existing AINC Preferred
Stock, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, until
such AINC Certificate is surrendered for transfer or exchange, have and be
entitled to exercise any voting and other rights with respect to, and to
receive any dividends or other distributions on, the shares of New Holdco
Common Stock or New Holdco Preferred Stock, as applicable, into which the
shares of Existing AINC Common Stock or Existing AINC Preferred Stock, as
applicable, represented by any such AINC Certificate have been converted
pursuant to Section 1.8, subject to the provisions of applicable Nevada law.

 



 

(C) Excluding any Dissenting Shares, within a reasonable period of time
following the Effective Time, New Holdco shall mail, or shall cause to be
mailed, to the persons who were registered holders of AINC Certificates
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal, in customary
form, containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such AINC
Certificates, if the holder so chooses, in exchange for a certificate (a " _
_New Holdco Certificate__"), or uncertificated shares in book-entry form,
representing the number of shares of New Holdco Common Stock or New Holdco
Preferred Stock, as applicable, into which the shares of Existing AINC Common
Stock or Existing AINC

 



     

 

 



 

Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such AINC Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.8.

 



 

(D) Excluding any Dissenting Shares, if any AINC Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, New Holdco may, in its discretion and as a
condition to the issuance of any New Holdco Certificate or uncertificated
shares of New Holdco Common Stock or New Holdco Preferred Stock, as
applicable, in book-entry form, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed AINC Certificate to post a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as New Holdco may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against New Holdco or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such AINC
Certificate.

 



 

(E) Excluding any Dissenting Shares, if any New Holdco Certificate is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the AINC Certificate surrendered for
exchange is registered, such exchange shall be conditioned upon: (i) the AINC
Certificate so surrendered being properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
for transfer; and (ii) the person requesting such exchange either paying any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of the New Holdco
Certificate in a name other than that of the registered holder of the AINC
Certificate surrendered, or establishing to the satisfaction of New Holdco, or
the transfer agent in respect of the New Holdco Common Stock or New Holdco
Preferred Stock, as applicable, that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



 

(F) Each New Holdco Certificate shall comply with all requirements set forth
in New Holdcos charter or bylaws and applicable law with respect to notice of
certain restrictions on ownership and transferability.

 



 

(G) AINC and New Holdco expect that the New Holdco Certificates delivered to
former AINC stockholders will reflect the change of New Holdcos name to
"Ashford Inc."

 



 

Section 1.11 _Dividends._ At the Effective Time and by operation of the Merger
and this Agreement, AINCs obligations with respect to any dividends or other
distributions to holders of Existing AINC Common Stock or Existing AINC
Preferred Stock that have been declared by AINC, but not paid prior to the
Effective Time will be assumed by New Holdco in accordance with the terms of
the declaration or accrual, as applicable. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, AINC will pay a dividend on the Existing AINC Preferred Stock in an
amount equal to the amount of accrued but unpaid dividends on the Existing
AINC Preferred Stock immediately prior to such time.

 



 

Section 1.12 _Stock Transfer Books._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of AINC shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Existing AINC Common Stock or Existing
AINC Preferred Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of AINC.

 



 

Section 1.13 _Plan of Reorganization and Plan of Exchange._ This Agreement,
together with the Combination Agreement, is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g),
and this Agreement, the Combination Agreement and the Remington Contribution
Agreement together are intended to constitute a single plan of exchange under
Section 351 of the Code. Each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take any actions or cause
any actions to be taken which would prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization

 



     

 

 



 

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the Remington Exchange
collectively to qualify, and will not knowingly take any actions or cause any
actions to be taken which would prevent the Merger and the Remington Exchange
collectively from qualifying, as an exchange under Section 351 of the Code.

 



 

Section 1.14 _Successor Issuer._ It is the intent of the parties hereto that
New Holdco be deemed a "successor issuer" of AINC in accordance with Rule
12g-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange
Act__ ") solely for purposes of the Exchange Act, and in accordance with Rule
414 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _ _Securities Act__ ")
solely for purposes of the Securities Act. At or after the Effective Time, New
Holdco shall file: (i) an appropriate report on Form 8-K describing the
Merger; and (ii) appropriate amendments to any registration statements of AINC
on Form S-8 in accordance with Section 2.2.

postpone the Stockholder Meeting: (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that

of the matters referenced within the definition of Required Stockholder Vote
or represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such Stockholder Meeting.

Directors of AINC and New Holdco or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated

method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the
Holders (as defined below) of any and all Registrable Securities covered by
such Resale Registration Statement. New Holdco shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Resale Registration Statement filed pursuant
to this Agreement to be effective, supplemented and amended to the extent
necessary to ensure that it is available for the resale of all Registrable
Securities by the Holders until all Registrable Securities covered by such
Resale Registration Statement have ceased to be Registrable Securities (the "
_ _Effectiveness Period__ "). The Resale Registration Statement when effective
(including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to
form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the
case of any prospectus contained in such Resale Registration Statement, in the
light of the circumstances under which a statement is made).

 



 

Section 5.2 _Obligations of New Holdco._ Whenever required under this Article
V to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, New Holdco will,
as expeditiously as possible:

 



 

(A) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the
Resale Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such
Resale Registration Statement as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by the Resale Registration Statement;

 



 

(B) furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of a prospectus including a
preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the

 



     

 

 



 

Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by
the Resale Registration Statement;

 



 

(C) use its best efforts to register and qualify the Registrable Securities
covered by the Resale Registration Statement under such other securities or
Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as reasonably requested by the Holders of
Registrable Securities; provided that New Holdco will not be required to
qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in
any such states or jurisdictions, unless New Holdco is already subject to
service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities
Act;

 



 

(D) cause the Registrable Securities registered for resale to be listed on a
national securities exchange or trading system and each securities exchange
and trading system on which similar securities issued by AINC are then listed;

 



 

(E) provide a transfer agent and a registrar for all such Registrable
Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such
registration;

 



 

(F) if requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities,
retain one or more nationally-recognized investment banking firms to act as
underwriter for the offering, and enter into such customary agreements
(including underwriting and lock-up agreements in customary form) and take all
such customary actions as the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities or the managing underwriter of such offering request in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of the all such Registrable Securities
(including, without limitation, making appropriate officers of New Holdco
available to participate in "road show" and other customary marketing
activities (including one-on-one meetings with prospective purchasers of the
Registrable Securities)); and

 



 

(G) use its best efforts to furnish, on the date on which such Registrable
Securities are sold to any underwriter: (i) an opinion, dated such date, of
the counsel representing New Holdco for the purposes of such registration, in
form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten
public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any; and (ii) a "comfort
letter" dated such date, from the independent certified public accountants of
New Holdco, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent
certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Delay Rights._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, New Holdco may, upon written notice to all Holders whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Resale Registration Statement, suspend such
Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of the Resale Registration
Statement (a " _ _Blackout Period__ ") (in which event the Holder shall
discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Resale
Registration Statement) if New Holdco is contemplating or has experienced a
material non-public event, the disclosure of which at such time, in the good
faith judgment of New Holdco, would materially adversely affect New Holdco or,
as to each Holder that is

 



     

 

 



 

subject to the securities trading policies of New Holdco applicable to
insiders of New Holdco, during any period in which insiders of New Holdco are
not permitted to trade in securities of New Holdco under the securities
trading policies of New Holdco applicable to insiders of New Holdco. Upon
disclosure of such information or the termination of the condition or
expiration of such period described above, New Holdco shall provide prompt
notice to the Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in the Resale
Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of sales
it has put into effect. Any such Blackout Period will be no longer than 60
days in the aggregate in any 365-day period and New Holdco will not utilize
this right more than once in any twelve -month period.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Cooperation by Holders._ New Holdco shall have no obligation to
include in the Resale Registration Statement Registrable Securities of a
Holder who has failed to timely furnish upon written request timely delivered
to such Holder such information that New Holdco determines, after consultation
with counsel, is reasonably required in order for the registration statement
or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to comply with the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Expenses._ New Holdco will pay all reasonable expenses incurred
pursuant to this Article V with respect to the registration of the Registrable
Securities as determined in good faith; provided that New Holdco shall not be
responsible for legal fees incurred by Holders in connection with the exercise
of such Holders rights under this this Article V.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Termination of Purchaser s Rights. _A Holders rights under this
Agreement shall terminate upon the termination of the Effectiveness Period.

will cease to be a Registrable Security when (a) a registration statement
covering such Registrable Security becomes or has been declared effective by
the SEC and such Registrable Security has been sold or disposed of pursuant to
such effective registration statement; (b) such Registrable Security has been
disposed of pursuant to any section of Rule 144 under the Securities Act (" _

(collectively, " _Ashford_ "), on the other hand, have shared office space in
the building located at 14185 Dallas Parkway in Dallas, Texas, which has been
leased to Remington Hotel Corporation (the " _Office Space_ "); and (ii)
Remington and Ashford have shared the cost of certain employees of Remington
who provide human resources, information technology and general office and
administrative support for both Ashford and Remington (collectively, the "
_Remington Employees_ ," and together with the Office Space, the "
_Operational Services_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof and pursuant to the Cost Sharing Agreement,
Ashford has reimbursed Remington for the actual cost of Ashfords allocable
portion of: (i) rent, utilities, parking, office equipment and other expenses
related to the Office Space; and (ii) salary, bonus, taxes and other
withholding, and other expenses paid to, on behalf of, or otherwise with
respect to, the Operational Services provided by the Remington Employees, all
pursuant to an allocation which is mutually agreed upon by such parties on a
quarterly basis;

 



 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, certain employees of Remington
(collectively, the " _Transition Services Employees_ ") have provided certain
family office related services to or on behalf of the Services Recipients,
including accounting, tax, legal and general office and administrative support
services (the " _Transition Services_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement and pursuant to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement, Holdings will
become a wholly owned Subsidiary of New Holdco and the underlying lease
relating to the Office Space will be held or subleased by New Holdco and/or
its Subsidiaries (the " _New Holdco Parties_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, as a result of the foregoing, the Remington Employees will be deemed
to be employees of the New Holdco Parties, and, therefore, there is no longer
a need for the allocation

 



     

 

 



 

of costs relating to the Office Space or with respect to the provision of the
Operational Services by the Remington Employees under the Cost Sharing
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, in replacement of the Cost Sharing Agreement, the New Holdco Parties,
on the one hand, and the Services Recipients, on the other hand, desire to
enter into this Agreement in order to document their agreement regarding: (i)
the provision by certain of the Transition Services Employees of Transition
Services to or on behalf of the Services Recipients; and (ii) the payment by
the Services Recipients of the Allocated Costs (as hereinafter defined in
_Section 2.1(a)_) for such Transition Services; and

 



 

WHEREAS, it is a condition under the Combination Agreement that the parties to
this Agreement (the " _Parties_ ") enter into this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the above premises and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereto hereby covenant and agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
TRANSITION SERVICES**

 



 

Section 1.1 **_Provision of Transition Services; Term of Agreement_**.

 



 

(a) During the period referenced in _Section 1.1(b)_ (the " _Term_ "), the
New Holdco Parties hereby agree to provide the Transition Services to the
Services Recipients, as directed by ABennett, MBennett or their respective
designated representatives, generally in accordance with past practice, and
the Services Recipients hereby agree to reimburse and pay the New Holdco
Parties for the Allocated Costs of the Transition Services received.

 



 

(b) Subject to the succeeding sentence, the Transition Services shall be
provided hereunder by the New Holdco Parties from the date of this Agreement
until the last to occur of: (i) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of
this Agreement; (ii) the death of Archie Bennett, Jr.; and (iii) 30 days
following the date on which MBennett is no longer employed by New Holdco as
its Chief Executive Officer, or substantially similar executive position, or
ceases to serve as a member of the board of directors of New Holdco. This
Agreement may be terminated: (1) on the date on which all of the Services
Recipients request (upon not less than thirty (30) days advance written
notice) that such Transition Services shall be terminated; (2) at the option
of either Party following a material breach of this Agreement by the other
Party, which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes, without limitation,
failure by any Service Recipient to pay the invoices submitted by the New
Holdco Parties in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ for the Transition
Services, and which breach is not cured within 30 days from the delivery of
notice of such breach to the breaching Party; or (3) as set forth in _Section
3.4_.

 



 

(c) The scope, quality and quantity of the Transition Services, and the amount
and quality of the time and resources to be allocated by the New Holdco
Parties to provide the Transition Services, will be substantially consistent
with the scope, quality and quantity of the comparable services provided by
Remington to the Services Recipients prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Cost Sharing Agreement shall be
immediately terminated as of the date hereof.

 



 

(e) During the Term and subject to the execution of a written joinder
agreement pursuant to which it shall become a party to this Agreement, the
estate of ABennett (upon his death) and the estate of MBennett (upon his
death) each shall have the option to become a "Party" and a "Services
Recipient" under this Agreement and, therefore, entitled to the benefits (and
subject to the obligations) of the Services Recipients hereunder, including
the right to receive Transition Services and the obligation to reimburse the
New Holdco Parties for the Allocated Costs of the Transition Services. Unless
and until such estate executes such joinder agreement, it shall not be treated
as a Party or a Services Recipient under this Agreement or entitled to any of
the benefits (or subject to any of the obligations) hereunder.

 



 

Section 1.2 **_Additional Services_**. The New Holdco Parties acknowledge that
there may be additional services not described above that may be desired by
the Services Recipients in order for the Services Recipients to handle their
respective affairs (the " _Additional Transition Services_ "). Accordingly,
the Services Recipients may request that the New Holdco Parties provide such
Additional Transition Services; _provided, however_ , that the New Holdco
Parties shall not be required to provide any such Additional Transition
Services unless the New Holdco Parties, in their sole discretion, determine to
do so. If the New Holdco Parties determine to provide any such Additional
Transition Services, then any such Additional Transition Service will be
deemed to be a Transition Service hereunder and such Additional Service shall
be taken into account by the Parties in determining the Allocated Costs of the
Transition Services received.

 



 

Section 1.3 **_Disclaimer; Independent Contractor; Limitation of Liability_**.
Except as expressly provided in _Section 1.1_, the New Holdco Parties make no
express or implied representation, warranty or guarantee relating to the
Transition Services or the quality or results of the Transition Services to be
provided under this Agreement, including any warranty of merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose, which are specifically disclaimed. The
Services Recipients acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not create
a fiduciary relationship, partnership, joint venture or relationships of trust
or agency between the Parties and that all Services are provided by New Holdco
Parties as an independent contractor. The Parties are not joint employers for
any purpose, and the New Holdco Parties will have the sole right to exercise
all authority with respect to the employment (including termination of
employment), assignment and compensation of its employees and representatives
providing Transition Services hereunder. In no event shall the liability of
the New Holdco Parties arising under or related to this Agreement exceed the
total amount received by such New Holdco Parties with respect to such
Transition Services in the prior one-year term hereunder except in the case of
the intentional fraud or misconduct undertaken with the specific intent to
engage in misconduct of the New Holdco Parties. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the New Holdco Parties will have no liability for
any action taken by any Person at the express direction of any Service
Recipient.

 



 

Section 1.4 **_No Representations Regarding Tax Treatment of Transition
Services_**. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties make no
representations as to any tax treatment or tax consequences to any Party of
the provision or receipt of Transition Services

 



     

 

 



 

provided under this Agreement, and the Parties agree to consult their own
independent tax advisers concerning such treatment.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II** 
**DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATED COSTS**

 



 

Section 2.1 **_Determination of Allocated Costs; Dispute Resolution;
Payment_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the date hereof and during the Term, the actual costs to
the New Holdco Parties of providing the Transition Services to the Services
Recipients, including, without limitation, the salaries, employment taxes and
benefits applicable to the employees of the New Holdco Parties actually
engaged in providing the Transition Services, based on the percentage of time
spent by such employees in providing such services relative to the time spent
by such employees on matters not relating to such services, plus applicable
allocated overhead and other expenses incurred, in each case without mark-up
(the " _Allocated Costs_ "), will be determined and allocated in good faith by
the Parties jointly, on a quarterly basis, commencing as of the end of the
third (3rd) calendar month following the date of this Agreement and continuing
thereafter as of the end of each succeeding three (3) calendar month period.
The Allocated Costs so determined by the Parties shall be subject to quarterly
review and approval by the Audit Committee of New Holdco (the " _Audit
Committee_ ").

 



 

(b) In the event of a dispute between the Service Recipients, on the one hand,
and the New Holdco Parties and/or the Audit Committee, on the other hand,
concerning the proposed Allocated Costs in respect of any quarterly period,
then the Service Recipients, on the one hand, and the New Holdco Parties
and/or the Audit Committee, on the other hand, shall mutually engage a
recognized certified public accountant acceptable to each of the them to
review disputed items and to determine the Allocated Costs for the quarterly
period in question; provided, however, if such Parties cannot agree on a
mutually acceptable certified public accountant, the Service Recipients, on
the one hand, and the New Holdco Parties and/or the Audit Committee, on the
other hand, each shall name a recognized certified public accountant and those
two certified public accountants shall select a third recognized certified
public accountant which shall be used for the purposes of this _Section
2.1(b)_. The selected certified public accountants opinion concerning the
Allocated Costs for the quarterly period in question shall be final and
binding on all Parties. The expenses of the certified public accountant will
be borne by the New Holdco Parties, on the one hand, and the Service
Recipients, on the other hand, in the same proportion by which their
respective positions as initially presented to the consultant differs from the
final resolution as determined by the certified public accountant.

 



 

(c) The Allocated Costs for each quarterly period during the Term, as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ or _Section 2.1(b)_, as applicable,
will be invoiced, in arrears, by the New Holdco Parties to the Services
Recipients. The Services Recipients will reimburse the New Holdco Parties
within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the Services Recipients of such
invoice. All reimbursement payments by the Services Recipients to the New
Holdco Parties pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ will be made in U.S. dollars
in immediately available funds. Although the Services Recipients will be
jointly responsible for reimbursing the New Holdco Parties for the cost of the
Transition Services, the Services Recipients may

 



     

 

 



 

separately agree upon their own respective allocation of such costs between
and among themselves.

Section 3.1 **_Notices_**. All notices and other communications hereunder

certified mail (return receipt requested) or transmitted by facsimile to the

to the Services Recipients, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached this
Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of
this Agreement when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or

breakdown or power outage, provided that, if the event in question continues
for a continuous period in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days, Services
Recipients shall be entitled to give notice in writing to New Holdco to

matter of hereof (other than the Combination Agreement) and contains the sole
and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. The Parties agree that this Agreement supersedes and replaces in its
entirety the Cost Sharing Agreement, which is deemed terminated, cancelled and

such date.

 



 

Section 3.6 **_No Waiver_**. No failure or delay on the part of any Party to
exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, remedy, power
or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right,
remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any

the same and shall be binding upon the New Holdco Parties and the Services
Recipients.

 



 

Section 3.8 **_Severability_**. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction, and in lieu of such prohibited or unenforceable provision, a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such prohibited
or unenforceable provision as may be permitted and enforceable in the
applicable jurisdiction(s) shall be deemed added as a part of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.9 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts (including by facsimile or PDF), all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the Parties may
execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. If any signature is
delivered by facsimile transmission or by PDF, such signature shall create a
valid and binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf the
signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
PDF signature were an original thereof.

 



 

Section 3.10 **_Successors and Assigns_**. Subject to _Section 1.1(e)_, this
Agreement shall not be assignable, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, by any Party without the prior written consent of each other
Party, and any attempt to assign any rights or obligations arising under this
Agreement without such consent shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

DISPUTE OR REMEDY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED

(b) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so: (i) any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating

covenants and agrees to the following:

respective customers, clients or vendors.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) each Bennett may provide service as an
officer, director, advisor or consultant, or be the owner of the securities,
of the Company, Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., Braemar Hotels and Resorts,
Inc., Ashford Hospitality Select, Inc., AIM Real Estate Hedged Equity Master

ownership, directly or indirectly, in any interest in real properties in the
lodging industry if he has presented such opportunity to the Company Board and
the Board of Directors of each of Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., Braemar
Hotels and Resorts, Inc. and any of their respective Affiliates in the lodging
industry and none of the foregoing (based on a determination by a majority of
the Disinterested Directors of each such Person), elects to pursue or
participate in such opportunity (such real properties, " _Hotel Properties_
"), provided each Bennett and his controlled Affiliates (other than the
Company, PM LLC and Remington LP and their respective Subsidiaries)
acknowledge and agree that its ownership of a Hotel Property shall be subject
to the provisions of _Section 2.01(c)_; (iii) each Bennett may own, directly
or indirectly, solely as a passive investment, securities of or other
interests in any Person (publicly traded or privately held) if such Bennett is
not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group that controls, such Person
and does not, directly or indirectly, own nine and nine-tenths percent (9.9%)
or more of any class of securities of or other interests in such Person,
provided that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 2.01(b)_ shall not
apply to ownership or management of securities by AIM Real Estate Hedged

LLC or any of their respective controlled Affiliates, whether currently
existing or created in the future; (iv) each Bennett may own, directly and
indirectly, stock in the Company and its Affiliates; (v) each Bennett may
continue to hold director and/or executive officer positions with the Company
and its Affiliates after the Closing; and (vi) no Person shall be treated as
directly or indirectly engaging in, or assisting others in engaging in, the
Project Management Business or the Hotel Management Business solely by reason
of providing or receiving services or taking any other actions pursuant to the
Transition Cost Sharing Agreement, the Hotel Services Agreement or the
Remington Contribution Agreement or at the request of the Company or its
Affiliates.

 



 

(c) During the Restricted Period, with respect to any Hotel Properties in
which the Bennetts, or any of their controlled Affiliates, own, directly or
indirectly (other than through their ownership interests in Ashford
Hospitality Trust, Inc. or Braemar Hotels and Resorts, Inc.), in the aggregate
at least a five percent (5%) interest (such Hotel Properties, " _Bennett-Owned
Properties_ "), each Bennett, and any of his controlled Affiliates, directly
or indirectly: (i) may Self-Manage the provision of Project Management
Business services and/or Hotel Management Business services to such Bennett-
Owned Properties, but may not provide any

 



     

 

 



 

such services to any other hotels not constituting Bennett-Owned Properties,
or (ii) may require that the Company provide Hotel Management Business
services and Property Management Business services pursuant to the terms of
the Hotel Services Agreement.

 



 

(d) During the Restricted Period, each Bennett will not, and will not permit
any of his controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit
any In-Scope Service Providers or encourage any such In-Scope Service Provider
to leave such position or hire any such In-Scope Service Provider who has left
such position, except pursuant to a general solicitation that is not directed
specifically to any such In-Scope Service Providers; provided, that nothing in
this _Section 2.01(d)_ will prevent each Bennett or any of his controlled
Affiliates from hiring: (i) any In-Scope Service Provider whose employment has
been terminated by Remington LP, PM LLC or the Company; (ii) after one hundred
and eighty (180) days from the date of termination of employment, any In-Scope
Service Providers whose employment has been terminated by the employee; or
(iii) any In-Scope Service Provider on a shared basis with each Bennett.

 



 

(e) During the Restricted Period, each Bennett will not, and will not permit
any of his controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit or
entice, or attempt to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of Remington
LP or PM LLC or potential clients or customers of Remington LP or PM LLC for
purposes of diverting their Project Management Business or Hotel Management
Business from Remington LP or PM LLC.

 



 

(f) Each Bennett acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of any
provision of this _Section 2.01_ would give rise to irreparable harm to the
Company, Remington LP and PM LLC, for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy, and agree that in the event of a breach or a threatened
breach by each Bennett of any such obligations, the Company will, in addition
to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in
respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including temporary
restraining orders, injunctions, specific performance and any other relief
that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any
requirement to post bond or to further demonstrate irreparable harm).

 



 

(g) Each Bennett acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
2.01_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
Company, Remington LP and PM LLC and constitute a material inducement to the
Company to enter into the Combination Agreement and consummate the
Transactions. In the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 2.01_
should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service,
or other limitations permitted by applicable law in any jurisdiction, then any
court is expressly empowered and requested to reform such covenant, and such
covenant will be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time,
geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable
law. The covenants contained in this _Section 2.01_ and each provision of
this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity
or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written will not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions of
this Agreement, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction will not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

(h) The Company (on behalf of itself and any Subsidiaries thereof) and MB
acknowledge and agree that the provisions set forth in this _Section 2.01_
(insofar as they pertain to MB or any of his controlled Affiliates) shall
supersede and replace, and shall be deemed to have amended, in their entirety
any conflicting provisions of the following agreements: (i) Section 10 (Non-
Competition, Non-Solicitation and Non-Interference) of that certain Employment
Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2014, as amended as of September 13, 2017,
between MB and Ashford Hospitality Advisors LLC; and (ii) Section 4 (Ashford
Inc. Exclusivity Rights) of that certain Ashford Inc. Amended and Restated
Mutual Exclusivity Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2018, among Ashford
Hospitality Advisors LLC, AINC, Remington Lodging and Hospitality, LLC and MB.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company agrees to cause any Subsidiary
thereof to enter into any additional agreements that may be necessary to carry
out the intent of foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.1(h)_, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by MB from time to time.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

3.01 _Assignment_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may

request, consent, approval, declaration, or other communication be given to or
served upon any of the parties or any other Person, such notice, demand,

upon actual, confirmed receipt thereof (whether by non-certified mail,
telecopy, telegram, express delivery, or otherwise), addressed to the Company
and each Bennett at the street or post office addresses, facsimile numbers or
e-mail addresses set forth on the signature pages to this Agreement (or to
such other addresses or facsimile number as such party may have specified by

pursuant to this provision). No notice, demand, request, consent, approval,
declaration, or other communication will be deemed to have been given or
received unless and until it sets forth all items of information required to
be set forth therein pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

3.04 _Choice of Law; Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE INTERPRETED AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES
DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES APPLICABLE THERETO
AND THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO AN AGREEMENT
EXECUTED, DELIVERED, AND PERFORMED THEREIN WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE
CHOICE-OF-LAW RULES THEREOF OR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE THAT COULD REQUIRE THE
APPLICATION OF THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION; AND

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF DELAWARE FOR ALL PURPOSES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, " _PROCEEDINGS_ "). EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES THAT
SERVICE OF SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
PROCEEDINGS MAY BE MADE AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO SERVICE
OF NOTICES, AND THAT SERVICE SO MADE WILL BE AS EFFECTIVE AS IF PERSONALLY
MADE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. IT IS THE INTENT OF EACH OF THE PARTIES THAT
ALL PROCEEDINGS BE HEARD AND LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN A COURT LOCATED IN NEW
CASTLE COUNTY, DELAWARE. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS
FREELY AGREED THAT: (i) ALL PROCEEDINGS WILL BE HEARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
_SECTION 3.04_; (ii) THE AGREEMENT TO CHOOSE COURTS LOCATED IN NEW CASTLE
COUNTY, DELAWARE TO HEAR ALL PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS _SECTION
3.04_ IS REASONABLE AND WILL NOT PLACE SUCH PARTY AT A DISADVANTAGE OR
OTHERWISE DENY IT ITS DAY IN COURT; (iii) IT IS A KNOWLEDGEABLE, INFORMED,

RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER DOCUMENTS ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,
COURSE OF DEALING OR STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN), OF THE COMPANY OR
SELLER.

 



 

3.05 _Integration; Amendment; Waivers_. This Agreement, together with the
other Transaction Documents, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and supersede all previous written, and all previous or
contemporaneous oral, negotiations, drafts, proposals, terms sheets,
understandings, arrangements, understandings, or agreements. This Agreement
may not be amended, modified, or supplemented, or any provision of this
Agreement waived, except by the written agreement of the Company and each
Bennett. The parties agree that no custom, practice, course of dealing, or
similar conduct will be deemed to amend, modify, or supplement any term of
this Agreement. The failure of any party to enforce any right or remedy under
this Agreement, or to enforce any such right or remedy promptly, will not
constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against such party,
nor excuse any other party from its obligations under this Agreement. Any
waiver of any such right or remedy by any party must be in writing and signed
by the party against which such waiver is sought to be enforced. No waiver
will be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver of any right beyond the
specific right waived in such waiver.

section, sentence, word, clause, or combination thereof causing such violation
will be inoperative (and in lieu thereof there will be inserted such
provision, sentence, word, clause, or combination thereof as may be valid and
consistent with the intent of the parties under this Agreement) and the

irreparable harm or to post any bond or surety.
