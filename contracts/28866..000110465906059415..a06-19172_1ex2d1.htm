NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the

provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the Second Merger, all

parties and specified in the Merger I Certificate of Merger, and such time is
hereinafter referred to as the "Merger I Effective Time."

duly filed with the Secretary of State or, subject to the DGCL, such later
time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Merger
II Certificate of Merger, which in any event shall be as promptly as
practicable after the Merger I Effective Time, and such time is hereinafter
referred to as the "Merger II Effective Time."

specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to waive the
condition) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (except

Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) (the
"Closing Date"), at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP,

Section 1.6 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

  

(a) At the Merger I Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this
Article I and Section 2.1, each share of Company Common Stock issued and

Shares) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the right to
receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to
the provisions of Section 1.7, either (i) the Per Share Stock Consideration

the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock, if any, issued by the
Company after the Cut-off Time and prior to the date of this Agreement upon
the exercise of the Company Options (outstanding as of the Cut-off Time and
disclosed in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) in accordance
with the terms of such Company Options and (iii) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock, if any, issued by the Company

     

   

after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Merger I Effective Time in
accordance with Section 5.1(d).

  

"Exchange Ratio" shall mean the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-
thousandth, obtained by dividing the Per Share Consideration by the Final
Parent Depositary Share Price.

  

"Final Parent Depositary Share Price" shall mean the average of the per share
closing sale prices of Parent Depositary Shares on the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE"), as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , for the
Valuation Period.

  

"Parent Depositary Share" means an American Depositary Share of Parent
representing one-fifth (0.20) of a Parent Ordinary Share.

  

"Parent Ordinary Share" means an ordinary share, nominal value 2.00 per
share, of Parent.

ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing the Aggregate Consideration by the Total
Common Stock Amount.

  

"Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean a number of Parent Depositary

"Total Cash Amount" shall mean (x) the product obtained by multiplying (1)
U.S. $75.00 by (2) 49.336% of the Deemed Stock Amount, minus (y) any cash
distributions made by the Company (I) after the date of this Agreement or

pursuant to Section 1.6(d).

  

"Total Stock Consideration" shall mean the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the Total Stock Amount by (y) the Final Parent Depositary Share Price.

  

"Valuation Period" shall mean the twenty consecutive trading days during
which the Parent Depositary Shares are traded on the NYSE ending on the third
calendar day

     

   

immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time, or if such calendar day is
not a trading day, then ending on the trading day immediately preceding such
calendar day.

  

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of (x) a certificate (each a "Certificate") previously
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock or (y) non-certificated
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry
Shares") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii)
any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c)
hereof, and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Parent
Depositary Shares in accordance with Section 2.1(e) hereof.

  

(c) All Parent Depositary Shares issued as provided in this Section 1.6 shall
be of the same class and shall have the same terms as the currently
outstanding Parent Depositary Shares. The Parent Ordinary Shares underlying
the Parent Depositary Shares that are issued in connection with the First
Merger shall be of the same class and shall have the same terms as the
currently outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares with all rights attached
or accrued to them to any distribution occurring after the Closing Date
(including without limitation, interim dividends or distributions out of
retained earnings or issuance or merger premium). Parent or the Company
shall, following the Closing, except as provided in Section 2.1(b), pay all
stamp duties, if any, imposed in connection with the issuance or creation of
the Parent Depositary Shares (and the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares) in
connection with the First Merger.

  

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Merger I Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Parent or the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Per Share
Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration.  Nothing in this
Section 1.6(d) shall be construed to permit either party to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement. Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, Parent shall not take any
action, including amending the deposit agreement between Parent and
Depositary that would cause each Parent Depositary Share to represent more or
less than one-fifth (0.20) of a Parent Ordinary Share.

  

(e) At the Merger I Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
stock or depositary shares of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 1.6(e) shall not apply to shares of Company
Common Stock held by or on behalf of the ESPP, as to which Section 1.6(a)
shall apply.

     

   

(f) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value U.S. $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger I Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value U.S. $0.01 per share, of
the Merger I Surviving Corporation.

  

(g) At the Merger II Effective Time, all outstanding shares of the Merger I
Surviving Corporation shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
stock or depositary shares of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be
issued or delivered in exchange therefore.

  

(h) The calculations required by Section 1.6(a) shall be prepared by Parent
promptly after the Closing.

  

Section 1.7 _Election Procedures_.

  

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of Company
Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Election Form") and pursuant to
which each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the close
of business on the Election Form Record Date may make an election pursuant to
this Section 1.7 shall be mailed together with the Proxy Statement or at such
other time as the Company and Parent may agree (the "Mailing Date") to each
holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the
record date for notice of the Company Special Meeting (the "Election Form
Record Date").

  

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock Election Shares"), (ii) the
number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration ("Cash
Election Shares"), or (iii) that such holder makes no election with respect
to such holders Company Common Stock ("No Election Shares"). Any Company
Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an
effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York
time, on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date
as the Company and Parent shall agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than
any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of
such time) shall also be deemed to be "No Election Shares."

  

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the

     

   

Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

  

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. With respect to shares of Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate, an Election Form shall be deemed properly
completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary
affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates)
representing all certificated shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in
the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares and Parent shall cause the Certificates, if any, representing
Company Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to the Person
submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the
holder who submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a
subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of the
applicable shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Merger Sub I,
Merger Sub II or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify
any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

  

(e) Within five Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the Merger
I Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after the Merger
I Effective Time as practicable (and in no event more than five Business Days
after the Merger I Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
effect the allocation among the holders of Company Common Stock of rights to
receive Parent Depositary Shares or cash pursuant to the First Merger in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

  

(i) _Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the
aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion of the Cash
Election Shares pursuant to the First Merger is greater than the Total Cash
Amount, then:

  

(1) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,

  

(2) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Stock
Designated Shares") such that the

     

   

aggregate cash amount that will be paid pursuant to the First Merger equals
as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all Stock Designated
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration, and

  

(3) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

  

(ii) _Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the
aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election
Shares pursuant to the First Merger is less than the Total Cash Amount,
then:

  

(1) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,

  

(2) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, in each
case by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Cash
Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid
pursuant to the First Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash
Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and

  

(3) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

  

(iii) _Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount_.  If the aggregate
cash amount that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares
pursuant to the First Merger is equal to the Total Cash Amount, then
subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration
and all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of
determining the allocations set forth in this Section 1.7(e), Parent shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to require that any shares of Company
Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of the Election Deadline be
treated as Cash Election Shares, although no such shares shall be subject to
any of the pro rata selection processes contemplated by this Section 1.7(e).

  

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
determined by Parent and the Company.

     

   

Section 1.8 _Stock Options_.

  

(a) Immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time, each option granted by
the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a "Company
Option") pursuant to any stock option plan, program or arrangement of the
Company, including, without limitation, the Companys 1992 Employee Non-
Qualified Stock Option Plan, 1992 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan,
2001 Key Employee Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, and the Share Incentive
Plan (collectively the "Company Option Plans"), which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time, whether or not
vested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, for each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such option immediately prior to
such cancellation and conversion, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share
under such option immediately prior to such cancellation and conversion (less
any applicable withholding Taxes). On the date of or promptly following the
Merger I Effective Time, Parent shall wire transfer to the Company such
aggregate amount as is required to be paid pursuant to this Section 1.8 and
shall cause the Company to pay on the Closing Date to the holders of the
Company Options by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amounts
such holders are entitled to receive hereunder.

  

(b) All Company Option Plans shall terminate as of the Merger I Effective
Time and the provisions in any Company Option Plan and the Companys 2001 Key
Employee Restricted Stock Plan (with the Company Option Plans, the "Company
Stock Plans" ) or any other plan providing for the issuance, transfer or
grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any
capital stock of the Company shall be terminated as of the Merger I Effective
Time, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
following the Merger I Effective Time no holder of a Company Option or any
participant in any Company Stock Plan or any other plan shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation.

  

(c) Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take all actions and
make all determinations necessary, in each case under the terms of the
Company Option Plans, to effect the provisions of this Section 1.8.

  

Section 1.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in the event appraisal rights are available under the DGCL,
with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the holder
thereof has properly demanded appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
has otherwise complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to
appraisal rights (each, a "Dissenting Share"), if any, such Dissenting Shares
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) but instead at the Merger I Effective Time
shall become the right to receive payment, solely from the Surviving
Corporation, of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided_ ,

     

   

 _however_ , that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the
circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively
withdraws his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal
rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares
takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such
holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder
or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares and such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon
cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and if such forfeiture shall occur
following the Election Deadline, each such Dissenting Share shall thereafter
be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Merger I
Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration into which No Election Shares shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 1.7(e), subject to the last sentence of Section 1.7(e).
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any
payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to
Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

ARTICLE II

  

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, (i) with The Bank of New York, as
depositary for the Parent Depositary Shares, or any successor
depositary thereto (the "Depositary"), a number of Parent Ordinary Shares
equal to one-fifth of the aggregate number of Parent Depositary Shares to be
issued as Merger Consideration, and (ii) with the Companys transfer agent or
a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to
the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and the receipts representing
such aggregate number of Parent Depositary Shares to make pursuant to this
Article II all deliveries of cash and Parent Depositary Shares as required by
Article I. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections
2.1(c) and 2.1(e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Any cash and receipts representing Parent Depositary Shares
deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares
in accordance with Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or

     

   

other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The cash portion of the Exchange Fund
shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States
of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively. If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange
Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 1.6, Parent shall take all steps
necessary promptly to, or to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation
promptly to, deposit (i) with the Depositary an additional number of Parent
Ordinary Shares equal to one-fifth of the aggregate number of additional
Parent Depositary Shares necessary and (ii) with the Exchange Agent in trust
additional cash and additional receipts representing Parent Depositary
Shares, in each case sufficient to make all payments required under this
Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be
liable for payment thereof. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Depositary and the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration.
 Subject to Section 2.1(f), any interest or other income resulting
from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of
the Exchange Fund.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.  As soon as practicable, after the Merger I
Effective Time, Parent shall instruct and cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each record holder, as of the Merger I Effective Time, of (i) an outstanding
Certificate that immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time represented
shares of Company Common Stock or (ii) Book-Entry Shares (x) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and
shall be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to
the Merger I Effective Time) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more Parent Depositary
Shares (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
Parent Depositary Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the
aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6 and this Article II, including cash payable in lieu of any
fractional Parent Depositary Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and dividends
and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(c). No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company

     

   

Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares
of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.1, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Merger I Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Depositary Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Depositary Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent
Depositary Shares (or the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares) with a record
date after the Merger I Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Parent
Depositary Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional Parent Depositary Shares shall be paid to any such holder until
such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
in accordance with this Section 2.1.  Subject to applicable law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to
such holder of Parent Depositary Shares issuable in exchange therefor,
without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount
of any cash due pursuant to Section 1.6 and cash payable in lieu of
fractional Parent Depositary Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Merger I Effective Time theretofore paid with respect
to the Parent Ordinary Shares and payable with respect to such Parent
Depositary Shares, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger I
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Depositary Shares. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Depositary
Shares, all Parent Depositary Shares to be issued pursuant to the First
Merger (excluding Parent Depositary Shares issuable upon exercise of options
which are issued pursuant to Section 1.8 unless such options are actually
exercised prior to the Merger I Effective Time, or upon conversion of the
Company Convertible Debt) shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such Parent Depositary Shares were
issued and outstanding as of the Merger I Effective Time.

  

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or

     

   

Section 2.1(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

  

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or Parent Depositary Shares
representing fractional Parent Depositary Shares or book-entry credit of the
same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Parent Depositary
Shares.

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the First Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Depositary
Share (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the average of the closing
sale prices of Parent Depositary Shares on the NYSE as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on
which the Merger I Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction of a
Parent Depositary Share which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit such
amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge that payment of cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Depositary Shares was not
separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting
problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent
Depositary Shares.

  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine
months after the Merger I Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any former holders
of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Depositary Shares
to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Depositary Shares to which they
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each case, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company
Common Stock three years after the Merger I Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any Liens (as defined in Section 8.5(e)), claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

     

   

(g) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of
Parent Depositary Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Depositary Shares to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.

  

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment.  To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

  

(j) _Affiliate Shares. _Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any "affiliate" of the Company (as
determined pursuant to Section 5.20) shall not be exchanged until Parent has
received a written agreement from such Person as provided in Section 5.20
hereof.

  

Section 2.2 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the date on
which the Merger I Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on
the records of the Company. From and after the close of business on the date
on which the Merger I Effective Time occurs, any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares presented to the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Depositary Shares to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon.

correct copy of each of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each
case as amended (if so amended) to the date of this Agreement, and has made

announcement (whether or not written) by Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
the Company or the trustees of any Company Plan relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Plan above the
level or expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year
ended prior to the date hereof.

(h) Assuming for this purpose that each individual who is a party to an
Employment Agreement (as defined below) with the Company or one of its

conditions of employment and related compensation and, for the avoidance of

Company Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization or similar benefits

grants of restricted Company Common Stock, (iii) accelerated conversion of
Deferred Share Units, (iv) accelerated vesting of incentive awards under the
Company Plans, and (v) lump-sum payments required under the Companys
Deferred Compensation Plan and related trust, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
other similar termination payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of or otherwise enhance any benefit due any
such employee, officer or director.

  

(k) Except with respect to any actions or omissions that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (1) there has
been no material failure of a Company Plan that is a group health plan (as
defined in section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to meet the requirements of
section 4980B(f) of the Code with respect to a qualified beneficiary (as
defined in section 4980B(g) of the Code), (2) neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined
in section 5000(c) of the Code), (3) no ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any
Subsidiary has incurred a tax under section 5000(a) of the Code which is or
could become a liability of the Company or a Subsidiary, and (4) there has
been no material failure on the part of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
the Company to comply with the Health Insurance Portability Accountability
Act of 1996, as amended.

  

(l) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or
anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Company Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary under any such Company Plan or otherwise involving any such
Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

  

(m) All material obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
required to be performed in connection with the Company Plans and funding
media established therefor have been performed.

  

(n) None of the Company Plans require or permit a retroactive increase in
premiums or payments, or require additional payments or premiums on the
termination of any Company Plan or insurance contract in respect thereof.

  

(o) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently sponsors,
maintains, contributes to or has any liability under, nor has ever sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or incurred any liability in Canada under a
"registered pension plan", "retirement compensation arrangement" or a
"deferred profit sharing plan", each as defined under the Income Tax Act
(Canada), a "pension plan" as defined under any Canadian applicable pension
benefits standards legislation, or any other plan organized and administered
to provide pensions for Canadian employees, officers or directors, other than
a Group RRSP as described in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

     

   

(p) The representations and warranties of the Company in this Section 3.9
shall specifically, but not by way of limitation, apply to Foreign Plans that
are Company Plans, as applicable.

  

(q) The contribution and benefit liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries respecting each Company Plan that is a Foreign Plan are fully
funded based upon applicable accounting valuation and actuarial methodology
contained in the most recent accounting, valuation or actuarial report
respecting the Foreign Plan.

(a) Except for such Litigation that individually or in the aggregate has not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, (A) there is no Litigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against, relating to or
naming as a party thereto the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of
their respective properties or assets or any of the Companys officers or
directors (in their capacities as such), (B) there is no agreement, order,
judgment, decree, injunction or award of any Governmental Entity against
and/or binding upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Companys officers or directors (in their capacities as such), and (C) there

against other parties, where such Litigation is intended to enforce or
preserve material rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(b) Except as individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied, and is in
compliance, with all Laws and Company Permits which affect the respective
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Real Property
and/or the Company Assets, including the Company Vessels, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries have not been and are not in violation of any such Law or
Company Permit; nor has any notice, charge, claim or action been received by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or been filed, commenced, or to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries alleging any violation of the foregoing, except for such
violations or allegations of violations as individually or in the aggregate
have not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of clause (b) above and mindful of the
principles of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
similar applicable foreign laws, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, in any such case, any of their respective Representatives
has (i) made, offered or authorized any payment or given or offered anything
of value directly or indirectly (including through a friend or family member
with personal relationships with government officials) to an official of any
government for the purpose of influencing an act or decision in his official
capacity or inducing him to use his influence with that government with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of the United
States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar applicable foreign
laws, (ii) made, offered or authorized any payment to any Governmental
Entity, political party or political candidate for the

to use any influence with that government with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act or other similar applicable foreign laws or (iii) taken any
action that would be reasonably likely to subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any material liability or penalty under any and all Laws of
any Governmental Entity.

  

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, permits,
certifications, variances, consents, authorizations, waivers, grants,
franchises, concessions, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of
Governmental Entities or other Persons necessary for the ownership, leasing,
operation, occupancy and use of the Real Property, the Company Assets,
including the Company Vessels, and the conduct of their respective businesses
as currently conducted ("Company Permits"), except where the failure to hold
such Company Permits individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would
not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice that any Company Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be
renewed in the ordinary course of business, and the Company has no knowledge
of any reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal,

and its officers and key employees, on the other hand, (ii) which, upon the
consummation of the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts
or events, including the passage of time) result in any payment or benefit
(whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due, or the acceleration or

Merger Sub II, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any officer, director, consultant or employee of

the Surviving Corporation (or any of its Affiliates) after the Merger I
Effective Time, to compete in or conduct any line of business or compete with
any Person or in any geographic area or during any period of time, in each
case, if such limitation is or is reasonably likely to be material to the

Section 3.12(a), whether or not included as an exhibit to the Company SEC
Documents, is referred to herein as a "Company Material Contract," and for
purposes of Section 5.1(r) and the bringdown of Section 3.12(b) pursuant to
Section 6.3(a), "Company Material Contract" shall include any such contract
arrangement, commitment or understanding that is entered into after the date

hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (y) the effect
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is

Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

(b) There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of the Company, against any Person whose liability for any
Environmental Claim the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of Law, except for
any such Environmental Claims which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

  

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no past or present actions,
activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, including the
Release or presence of any Hazardous Material, which would be reasonably
likely to form the basis of any Environmental Claim against the Company or

any property currently or, to the knowledge of the Company, formerly owned

and its Subsidiaries own, or otherwise have sufficient and legally
enforceable rights to use, all of their respective tangible properties and
assets (real, personal or mixed) (the "Company Assets") that they purport to

leased to the Company or its Subsidiaries, no Person has any rights to, or
interest in, any of the agreements pursuant to which the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries charters any Company Vessel (each, a "Company Charter") or
the Company Vessels created by, through or under the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All operating expenses owed by the Company with respect to each
Company Vessel have been timely and fully paid. To the knowledge of the

lapse of time, or both, would give, the owners of the Company Vessels the
right to withdraw any of the Company Vessels from the Companys or any of its
Subsidiarys service prior to the end of the applicable primary or option
terms specified in the Company Charter. There are no material amounts or
obligations being contested under any Company Charter, and there are
no material unresolved disputes under any Company Charter.

Except as set forth in (i) the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Parent Disclosure Letter") (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered

     

   

representation, warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and such
other representations, warranties or covenants to the extent a matter in such
section is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to such other
representation, warranty or covenant reasonably apparent) or (ii) the Parent
SEC Documents filed with the SEC between December 31, 2005 and the date of
this Agreement, but excluding any risk factor disclosure contained in any
such Parent SEC Report under the heading and excluding information set forth
in any exhibit thereto "Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-

disclosure in the Specified Parent SEC Disclosure is responsive to the
matters set forth in this Article IV, Parent, and, upon execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

Section 4.1 _Organization._ Each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and
Parents Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such
concept exists in such jurisdiction) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, and has all requisite corporate or other
power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub I and Merger Sub II and each of Parents Significant Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction (to the extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where
the character of the property owned, operated or leased by it or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Since the date of its incorporation, neither Merger
Sub I nor Merger Sub II has engaged in any activities other than
in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement and each of Merger
Sub I and Merger Sub II do not have any Subsidiaries.  Parent has previously
made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of its articles of
association and by-laws as in effect on the date of this Agreement. None of
Parent, Merger Sub I, or Merger Sub II is in violation of its articles of
association, certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational
documents. Section 4.1 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
correct list of all of the Significant Subsidiaries of Parent and their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization. The respective
certificates or articles of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Significant Subsidiaries of Parent do not contain any
provision limiting or otherwise restricting the ability of Parent to control
its Significant Subsidiaries in any material respect.

  

Section 4.2 _Capitalization._

conditions.  No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the
right to vote (or convertible into or exchangeable for securities having the

issued or outstanding. All issued and outstanding shares of Parents capital
stock are, and all shares that may be issued or granted pursuant to the
exercise of Parent Stock Options will be, when issued or granted in
accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding or authorized (x) options, warrants,
preemptive rights, subscriptions, calls or other rights, convertible
securities, agreements, claims or commitments of any character obligating
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity interest in Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, (y) contractual obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or any such securities or agreements listed in clause (x)
of this sentence, or (z) voting trusts or similar agreements to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the
capital stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The Parent
Depositary Shares and the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares issued pursuant
to the First Merger, when issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid (and, with
respect to the Parent Depositary Shares nonassessable), and not subject to
preemptive rights.

  

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (or equivalent
equity interests of entities other than corporations) of each of Parents
Subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent free and clear of
any Liens, other than statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and
such restrictions as may exist under applicable Law, and all such shares or
other ownership interests have been duly authorized, validly issued and are
fully paid and non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Upon formation, all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II will be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent.

  

Section 4.3 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement_.  Parent has, and upon
formation each of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II will have, the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, with respect to the

Approval.  The execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this
Agreement and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated

of Directors contemplated by Section 5.13 (collectively, the "Parent

other corporate or other proceedings on the part of either Parent, Merger Sub
I or Merger Sub II will be necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent, and, upon the
execution and delivery by each of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II,  will have
been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II, and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding agreement of the Company, constitutes (or, with respect to Merger Sub
I and Merger Sub II, upon execution and delivery will constitute) a valid and
binding agreement of each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub
II enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy,

its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent, or to which Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent is party, whether written
or oral, for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or
director of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent
(the "Parent Plans" in effect as of the date of this Agreement) is subject to
Title IV or section 302 of ERISA. No liability under Title IV or section 302
of ERISA has been incurred by Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent that
has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a
material risk to Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent of incurring any
such liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due). Insofar as the
representation made in this Section 4.9(a) applies to sections 4064, 4069 or
4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it is made with respect to any employee benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which
Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent made, or was required to make,
contributions during the five-year period ending on the last day of the most
recent plan year ended prior to the Closing Date.

  

(b) None of Parent, any ERISA Affiliate of Parent, any of the Parent Plans,
any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof has
engaged in a transaction or has taken or failed to take any action in
connection with which Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
of Parent could be subject to a civil penalty

     

   

assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975(a) or (b), 4976 or 4980B of the Code.

  

(c) Each of the Parent Plans has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms, all employee plan summaries
and booklets and applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

  

(d) Each of the Parent Plans that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the
Code, and Parent (or the relevant Subsidiary) has received a currently
effective determination letter from the IRS stating that it is so qualified,
and no event has occurred which would affect such qualified status. Any fund
established under a Parent Plan that is intended to satisfy the requirements
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has so satisfied such requirements.

  

(e) There has been no material failure of a Parent Plan that is a group
health plan (as defined in section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to meet the
requirements of section 4980B(f) of the Code with respect to a qualified
beneficiary (as defined in section 4980B(g) of the Code). Neither Parent nor
any Subsidiary has contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as
defined in section 5000(c) of the Code) and no ERISA Affiliate of Parent
or any Subsidiary has incurred a tax under section 5000(a) of the Code which
is or could become a liability of Parent or a Subsidiary. There has been no
material failure on the part of Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent to
comply with the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act of 1996, as
amended.

  

(f) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened or
anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Parent Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary under any such Parent Plan or otherwise involving any such Parent
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

  

Section 4.10 _Litigation; Compliance with Law._

  

(a) Except for such Litigation that individually or in the aggregate has not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, (A) there is no Litigation pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against, relating to or naming as
a party thereto Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, or any of Parents
other Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or assets or any of
Parents officers or directors (in their capacities as such), (B) there is no
agreement, order, judgment, decree, injunction or award of any Governmental
Entity against and/or binding upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
Parents officers or directors (in their capacities as such) and (C) there is
no Litigation that Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, or any of Parents
other Subsidiaries, has pending against other parties, where such Litigation
is intended to enforce or preserve material rights of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

(b) Except as individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
each of

   

48   

 

  

Parent and its Subsidiaries has complied, and is in compliance with all Laws
and Parent Permits which affect the respective businesses of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, the Real Property and/or Parent Assets, and Parent and
its Subsidiaries have not been and are not in violation of any such Law or
Permit; nor has any notice, charge, claim or action been received by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or been filed, commenced, or to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries alleging any
violation of the foregoing, except for such violations or allegations of
violations as individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of clause (b) above and mindful of the
principles of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
similar applicable foreign laws, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, in any such case, any of their respective Representatives has (i) made,
offered or authorized any payment or given or offered anything of value
directly or indirectly (including through a friend or family member with
personal relationships with government officials) to an official of any
government for the purpose of influencing an act or decision in his official
capacity or inducing him to use his influence with that government with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of the United
States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar applicable foreign
laws, (ii) made, offered or authorized any payment to any Governmental
Entity, political party or political candidate for the purpose of influencing
any official act or decision, or inducing such Person to use any influence
with that government with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar
applicable foreign laws or (iii) taken any action that would be reasonably
likely to subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any material liability
or penalty under any and all Laws of any Governmental Entity.

  

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, permits, certifications,
variances, consents, authorizations, waivers, grants, franchises,
concessions, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of Governmental
Entities or other Persons necessary for the ownership, leasing, operation,
occupancy and use of the Real Property, Parent Assets and the conduct of
their respective businesses as currently conducted ("Parent Permits"), except
where the failure to hold such Parent Permits individually or in the
aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result
in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received notice that any Parent Permit will be
terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and Parent has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such
termination, modification or nonrenewal. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers or
any other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any
Parent Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewal
thereof, except in each case for such violations, terminations, modifications
or nonrenewals that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would
not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

  

(e) This Section 4.10 does not relate to matters with respect to (i) Parent
Plans, ERISA and other employee benefit matters (which are the subject of

     

   

Section 4.9), or (ii) Tax Laws and other Tax matters (which are the subject
of Section 4.13).

  

Section 4.11 _Intellectual Property._

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or
as individually or in the aggregate would not be reasonably likely to have
or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent:

(except Permitted Liens) including but not limited to liens, charges,
mortgages, title retention agreements or title defects;

  

(ii) to Parents knowledge, no consent, co-existence or settlement
agreements, judgments, or court orders limit or restrict Parents or any of
its Subsidiarys ownership rights in and to any Intellectual Property owned
by them;

  

(iii) the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted does not, to the knowledge of Parent, infringe or misappropriate
any third Persons Intellectual Property; or

  

(iv) to the knowledge of Parent, no third Person is infringing or
misappropriating any Intellectual Property, owned by Parent or its
Subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of Parent there is no litigation pending
or threatened in writing by or against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
received any written charge, claim, complaint, demand, letter or notice, that
asserts a claim (a) alleging that any or all of Parent IP Rights infringe or
misappropriate any third partys Intellectual Property, or (b) challenging
the ownership, use, validity, or enforceability of any Parent IP Right.

  

(b) All Intellectual Property owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries that is the
subject of an application for registration or a registration ("Registered
Parent IP") is to the knowledge of Parent, in force, and all application,
renewal and maintenance fees in relation to all Registered Parent IP have
been paid to date, except for any Registered Parent IP that Parent has
abandoned, not renewed or allowed to expire.

  

(c) Except for such matters as individually or in the aggregate have not had
and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent, to Parents knowledge (i) there does not exist, nor has
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries received written notice of, any breach of
or violation or default under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any material contracts related to Parent IP Rights, and (ii) neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of the desire of the
other party or parties to any such material contracts relating to Parent IP
Rights to

     

   

exercise any rights such party or parties have to cancel, terminate or
repudiate such material contract relating to Parent IP Rights or exercise
remedies thereunder.

  

Section 4.12 _Material Contracts._

  

(a) Except for such agreements or arrangements that are included as an
exhibit to the Parent SEC Documents, as of the date hereof, none of Parent,
Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, nor any of Parents other Subsidiaries, is a
party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral) (i) which is a material contract (as defined in
Item 19 of Form 20-F under the Securities Act) to be performed after the date
of this Agreement, (ii) which expressly limits the ability of Parent or any
Subsidiary Parent to compete in or conduct any line of business or compete
with any Person or in any geographic area or during any period of time, in
each case, if such limitation is or is reasonably likely to be material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) which is a material
joint venture agreement, joint operating agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar contract or agreement involving a sharing of profits and
expenses with one or more third Persons, or (iv) which is a shareholder
rights agreement or which otherwise provides for the issuance of any
securities in respect of this Agreement or the Mergers. Each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this
Section 4.12(a), whether or not set forth in Section 4.12(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, is referred to herein as a "Parent Material Contract."
Parent has previously made available to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of each Parent Material Contract that is not included as an
exhibit to the Parent SEC Documents.

  

(b) Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding and in full force and
effect and Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have performed all obligations
required to be performed by them to date under each Parent Material Contract,
except where such failure to be valid and binding or in full force and effect
or such failure to perform individually or in the aggregate has not had and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. Except for such matters as individually or in the aggregate have
not had and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, to Parents knowledge (i) there does not exist, nor
has Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or any of Parents other
Subsidiaries received written notice of, any breach of or violation or
default under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Parent

any of Parents other Subsidiaries has received written notice of the desire
of the other party or parties to any such Parent Material Contract
to exercise any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate
such Parent Material Contract or exercise remedies thereunder. Each Parent
Material Contract is enforceable by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to or
limited by (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and
(y) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) or except
where such unenforceability individually or in the aggregate has not had and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481(c) of
the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or

Section 4.14 _Parent Assets._

  

Except as individually or in the aggregate would not be reasonably likely to
have or result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, Parent and its
Subsidiaries own, or otherwise have sufficient and legally enforceable rights
to use, all of their respective tangible properties and assets (real,
personal or mixed) (the "Parent Assets") that they purport to own. Except as
individually or in the aggregate would not be reasonably likely to have or
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries
have valid title to, or in the case of leased property have valid leasehold
interests in, all such Parent Assets, including all such Parent Assets
reflected in Parent Balance Sheet or acquired since the date thereof (except
as may have been disposed of since December 31, 2005 or may be disposed of
after the date of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement in either
case in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), in
each case free and clear of any Liens, except Permitted Liens. All material
operating equipment of Parent and its Subsidiaries is, in the aggregate, in a
state of repair so as to be adequate in all material respects for reasonably
prudent operations in the areas in which they are operated.

     

   

Section 4.15 _Financing_. Parent has received a commitment letter (including
the term sheet referenced therein, but excluding the fee letter referenced
therein) from Credit Suisse International (the "Commitment Letter") whereby
such financial institution has committed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, to provide, debt financing that, when combined
with Parents other sources of financing (including cash on hand), is
sufficient to fund the Total Cash Amount and the expenses of Parent, Merger
Sub I and Merger Sub II in connection with the Mergers. Parent has delivered
to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the letter referred to in
this Section 4.15 as in effect on the date hereof (including any amendments
in effect through the date of this Agreement). The Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect. The obligations of the financing sources to fund the
commitments under the Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions
other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Commitment Letter by
Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no knowledge of any
facts or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in (i) any of the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter not being satisfied or (ii) the
funding contemplated in the Commitment Letter not being made available to
Parent on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

Section 4.16 _Affiliate Transactions_.  Section 4.16 of the Parent Disclosure

indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries) on the other hand, are or have been a
party or otherwise bound or affected, and that (a) are currently pending, in

account of any of its customers as of the date of this Agreement. All
such Derivative Transactions were, and any Derivative Transactions entered
into after the date of this Agreement will be, entered into in accordance
with applicable Laws, and in accordance with the investment,
securities, commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and
procedures employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries, and were, and will be,

forth in Section 4.17 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, still believes to be
financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in
consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative
Transactions. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have, and will have, duly
performed all of their respective obligations under the Derivative
Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued,
and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are and will

     

   

be no breaches, violations, collateral deficiencies, requests for collateral
or demands for payment, or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by
any party thereunder.

and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.  Except as set forth in Section 4.18 of the Parent Disclosure Letter
and subject to the compliance dates for "foreign private issuers" as defined
in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, neither Parent nor its independent

contemplated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Union measure.

of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and

     

   

Rothschild as and to the extent set forth in their respective engagement

ARTICLE V

  

COVENANTS

  

Section 5.1 _Interim Operations of the Company_.

  

The Company covenants and agrees as to itself and its Subsidiaries that
during the period from the date of this Agreement until the Merger I
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
earlier terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, except as (w) set forth in
Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (x) expressly contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, (y) required by applicable Law, or (z) consented
to in writing by Parent after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Merger I Effective Time (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned):

  

(a) the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be conducted only
in the ordinary course substantially consistent with past practices, and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business
organization and goodwill and the business organization and goodwill of its
Subsidiaries and to keep available the services of their current officers and
key employees and preserve and maintain existing relations with key
customers, suppliers, officers, employees and creditors;

  

(b) the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
(i) enter into any new line of business, or (ii) incur or commit to any
capital expenditures, or any obligations or liabilities in connection with
any capital expenditures other than capital expenditures and obligations or
liabilities incurred or

     

   

committed to in an amount not greater in the aggregate than, and during the
same time period set forth in, the Companys current capital budget reviewed
by the Company Board in August 2006, the amount of which has been furnished to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Capital Budget"), and
excluding capital expenditures to repair lost or damaged property or
equipment in the ordinary course of business substantially consistent with
past practice; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if the Closing Date has not occurred
on or prior to January 15, 2006 but is reasonably expected to occur within
the succeeding 60 days, then the Company shall prepare and provide to Parent
a revised capital budget for the remainder of the Companys fiscal year which
describes and reprioritizes the capital expenditures and commitments intended
to be made in the remainder of the fiscal year based on the then current
facts and circumstances for the Company and the potential impact on the
combined company. The Company and Parent agree to work in good faith to
reasonably agree on the revised plan taking into account what is prudent and
appropriate for the business of the Company; and if Parent objects to the
aggregate amount of such spending the Company will endeavor to revise the
plan in accordance with the reasonable objections from Parent except (i)
to the extent that the Company Board determines in good faith that to make
such revisions would be reasonably likely to adversely effect the
Companys competitive position, future operating results, the safety of its
employees or its compliance with Law, (ii) to the extent the proposed
spending or commitments are consistent with past practice and prudent
operation of the business of the Company or (iii) where permitting Parent to
participate in the spending decision would violate or prejudice the rights of
its customers or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement. If a revised plan is agreed among the
Company and Parent, the Company shall not spend or make commitments for
capital spending in excess of the amounts set forth in the revised plan,
subject to the right to make emergency expenditures and commitments to the
extent that unforeseen circumstances require it;

  

(c) the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
amend its certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational
documents;

  

(d) the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries (other
than direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries) to, declare, set aside or
pay any dividend or other distribution, whether payable in cash, stock or any
other property or right, with respect to its capital stock or other equity

Section 5.3 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  

(a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective officers,
directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
agents and other representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to (i)
directly or indirectly initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or to any Person that the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
knows or has reason to believe is contemplating making an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company, or (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the Company or enter into any agreement, including any letter
of intent or agreement in principle (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement in circumstances contemplated in the penultimate sentence of this
Section 5.3(a)), (x) providing for, constituting or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or (y) that would require,
or would have the effect of causing, the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the First Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.  Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or by any Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Representative is so authorized, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board
may take any actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(a) with
respect to a third party at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required
Vote if, prior to such vote, (x) the Company receives a written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company from such third party (and such
Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or
facilitated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives after the date of this Agreement), (y) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors) that such proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in
a Superior Proposal with respect to the Company, and (z) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that
the failure to participate in such negotiations or discussions or to furnish
such information or data to such third party would be reasonably expected to
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, provided that (I) the Company shall not deliver any information to such
third party without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
(II) actions taken pursuant to this sentence shall not constitute a violation
of clause (i) of this Section 5.3(a). Nothing contained in this Section 5.3
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
the Companys stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case
to the extent required by applicable Law.

     

   

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub
II), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the First
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt
or approve, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend (unless, in each case, in conjunction with a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change permitted under this Section 5.3(b)),
or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or
that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(a)) (each an
"Acquisition Agreement") or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the First Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to the
Companys compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and
Section 5.6, in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to the Company,
the Company Board or any committee thereof may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to the
Company (X) until three Business Days after the Company provides written
notice to Parent (a "Company Notice") advising Parent that the Company Board
or a committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal with respect to the
Company, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal
and (Y) if during such three Business Day period, Parent proposes any
alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement), unless the Company Board determines in good faith (1) after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account all financial, legal, and regulatory terms and conditions
of such alternative transaction proposal) that such alternative transaction
proposal is not at least as favorable to the Company and its stockholders
from a financial point of view as the Superior Proposal and (2) after
consultation with its outside counsel that its failure to do so would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law to the stockholders of the Company (it being understood that
any material change in the financial or other material terms of a Superior
Proposal with respect to the Company after the Company Notice shall require a
new Company Notice and a new three Business Day period under this Section
5.3(b)).

  

(c) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as

   

64   

 

  

practicable after receipt thereof (but in no event more than 24 hours after
the Companys receipt thereof), the Company shall advise Parent in writing of
any request for information from a Person that has made, or the Company
reasonably believes may be contemplating, an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company or any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company received from any Person, or any inquiry made or discussions
or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company, and the material terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or
negotiations, and the Company shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any
written materials received by the Company in connection with any of the
foregoing, and the identity of the Person or group making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or inquiry or with whom any
discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it
shall provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or group in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company which was not previously
provided to Parent as promptly as practicable after it provides such
information to such other Person **.** The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposals with respect to the
Company (including the identity of the parties and price involved and any
material changes to any terms and conditions thereof).  The Company agrees
not to release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality agreement related to any potential Acquisition Proposal or
any standstill agreement, in each case in favor of the Company.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to the Companys
compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section
5.6, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
described in clause (A) of the definition thereof if the Company Board (i)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company, (ii) determines in good faith that the reasons
for making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change are independent of any
pending Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and (iii) provides
written notice to Parent (a "Company Notice of Change") advising Parent that
the Company Board is contemplating making a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and specifying the material facts and information constituting the
basis for such contemplated determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
the Company Board may not make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
until the third Business Day after receipt by Parent of the Company Notice of
Change and (y) during such three Business Day period, at the request of
Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes
or modifications to this Agreement which would allow the Company Board not to
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary
duties.

  

(e) Parent agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective Representatives not to (i)
directly or indirectly

     

   

initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding or the making or
submission of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, (ii) participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public
information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to
the properties, books or records of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or to any
Person that Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives knows or has reason to believe is contemplating
making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, or (iii) accept an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or enter into any agreement,
including any letter of intent or agreement in principle (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in circumstances contemplated in the
penultimate sentence of this Section 5.3(e)), (x) providing for, constituting
or relating to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or (y) that
would require, or would have the effect of causing, Parent to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the First Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by any of Parents Subsidiaries or by any Representative of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Representative is so authorized, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Parent Board may take any
actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(e) with respect to a
third party at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval
if, prior to such approval, (x) Parent receives a written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Parent from such third party (and such Acquisition
Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
after the date of this Agreement), (y) the Parent Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) that such proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal with
respect to Parent, and (z) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to participate in
such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such information or data to
such third party would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the
Parent Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided that (I)
Parent shall not deliver any information to such third party without entering
into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (II) actions taken pursuant
to this sentence shall not constitute a violation of clause (i) of this
Section 5.3(e). Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit Parent
or the Parent Board from taking and disclosing to Parents shareholders a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent required by
applicable Law.

  

(f) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to the
Company), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to the Company), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Parent Board or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the First Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal with respect

     

   

to Parent (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Parent Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend (in each such case unless in
connection with a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change permitted under this
Section 5.3(f)), or allow Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or
enter into, any Acquisition Agreement with respect to Parent (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(e)) or
(B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the First Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining
Parent Required Vote, and subject to Parents compliance at all times with
the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, in response to a Superior
Proposal with respect to Parent, the Parent Board or any committee thereof
may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal with respect
to Parent (X) until three Business Days after Parent provides written notice
to the Company (a "Parent Notice") advising the Company that the Parent Board
or a committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal with respect to
Parent, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal
and (Y) if during such three Business Day period, the Company proposes any
alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement), unless the Parent Board determines in good faith (1) after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account all financial, legal, and regulatory terms and conditions
of such alternative transaction proposal) that such alternative transaction
proposal is not at least as favorable to Parent and its shareholders from a
financial point of view as the Superior Proposal and (2) after consultation
with its outside counsel that its failure to do so would be reasonably
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to
the shareholders of Parent (it being understood that any material change in
the financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal with respect to
Parent after the Parent Notice shall require a new Parent Notice and a new
three Business Day period under this Section 5.3(f)).

  

(g) Parent agrees that in addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof (but in no event more than 24 hours after Parents receipt
thereof), Parent shall advise the Company in writing of any request for
information from a Person that has made, or Parent reasonably believes may be
contemplating, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent received from any Person, or any
inquiry made or discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent,
and the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and Parent shall promptly provide to
the Company copies of any written materials received by Parent in connection
with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the Person or group making any
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. Parent agrees that it shall provide to
the Company any non-public information concerning Parent or its
Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or group in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal with

     

   

respect to Parent which was not previously provided to the Company as
promptly as practicable after it provides such information to such other
Person **.** Parent shall keep the Company fully informed of the status of
any Acquisition Proposals with respect to Parent (including the identity of
the parties and price involved and any material changes to any terms and
conditions thereof). Parent agrees not to release any third party from, or
waive any provisions of, any confidentiality agreement related to any
potential Acquisition Proposal or any standstill agreement, in each case in
favor of Parent.

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, and subject to Parents
compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section
5.6, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
described in clause (A) of the definition thereof if the Parent Board (i)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of Parent, (ii) determines in good faith that the reasons for
making such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change are independent of any
pending Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent and (iii)
provides written notice to the Company (a "Parent Notice of Change") advising
the Company that the Parent Board is contemplating making a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the material facts and
information constituting the basis for such contemplated determination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Parent Board may not make such a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change until the third Business Day after receipt by
the Company of the Parent Notice of Change and (y) during such three Business
Day period, at the request of the Company, Parent shall negotiate in good
faith with respect to any changes or modifications to this Agreement which
would allow the Parent Board not to make such Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change consistent with its fiduciary duties.

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with
respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, any bona fide proposal,
whether or not in writing (other than by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Company, or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
with respect to Parent), for the (i) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business or assets that generates or constitutes 15% or more of
the net revenues, net income or the assets (based on the fair market value
thereof) of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including
capital stock of or ownership interest in any Subsidiary), (ii) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity
securities or capital stock of such party or any of its Subsidiaries whose
business generates or constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income
or assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation,
restructuring, transfer of assets or other business combination, sale of
shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization,
stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that if consummated
would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of such party or any of its Subsidiaries whose
business generates or constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income
or assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The term "Superior

     

   

Proposal" shall mean, with respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party
that was not initiated, solicited, facilitated or knowingly encouraged by
such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, made by a third party to purchase all of the outstanding
equity securities or capital stock of such party or all of the businesses and
assets of such party and its Subsidiaries pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger or asset purchase (x) on terms which a majority of the
Board of Directors of such party determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors, and taking into account all financial, legal and
regulatory matters, including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement offered by the other party in response to such Superior Proposal),
including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any
risks of non-consummation, of such Acquisition Proposal) to be superior
to such party and its stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) from
a financial point of view as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to any alternative transaction or changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the other party hereto pursuant to this Section 5.3 and
(y) which is likely to be consummated on its terms.

  

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, any factually accurate and complete public
statement by a party hereto that does nothing more than disclose the receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party that was not initiated,
solicited or knowingly facilitated or encouraged after the date of this
Agreement by such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, and the terms thereof, shall not be deemed to be a
recommendation of such Acquisition Proposal or the withdrawal, amendment or
modification of the recommendation of the Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) in favor of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

(k) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
party hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
possible Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party. Each party agrees
that it shall (i) take the necessary steps to promptly inform
its Representatives involved in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.3 and (ii) request
each Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such Persons consideration of any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to such party or any similar transaction to return or destroy (which
destruction shall be certified in writing by an executive officer of such
Person) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on its behalf.

  

Section 5.4 _Access to Information and Properties_.

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives
of the other party, including officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other

     

   

representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Merger I Effective Time, to all of its
properties, offices, contracts, books, commitments, records, data and books
and personnel and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other parties all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other parties may
reasonably request. No party or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Merger I Effective Time, Parent
and its authorized representatives, including engineers, advisors and
consultants, lenders and financing sources, may enter into and upon all or
any portion of the Real Property in order to investigate and assess, as
Parent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, the environmental condition
of the Real Property, the Company Assets or the businesses of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent Investigation").  The Parent
Investigation may include a Phase I environmental site assessment, or similar
or related non-invasive investigation. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, (i) cooperate with Parent in conducting any such
Parent Investigation, (ii) allow Parent reasonable access to the Companys
and its Subsidiaries respective businesses, the Real Property and the
Company Assets, and grant with full permission to conduct any such Parent
Investigation, and (iii) provide to Parent all plans, soil or surface or
ground water tests or reports, any environmental investigation results,
reports or assessments previously or contemporaneously conducted or prepared
by or on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their
predecessors, that are in the possession of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or are reasonably available to the Company or any Subsidiary
from any agent, consultant, contractor or other third party service provider,
and all information relating to environmental matters regarding the Companys
and its Subsidiaries respective businesses, the Real Property and the
Company Assets that is in the possession of, or reasonably available to, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(c) The Company shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each owner of a Company Vessel subject to a Company Charter (by exercising
its inspection rights under the applicable Company Charter) to allow Parent
at Parents sole cost, risk and expense, to inspect the Company Vessels at
any reasonable time, provided that such inspection shall be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Company
Vessels. Any such inspection may include (to the extent permitted under the
applicable Company Charter) the opening up of the machinery and equipment.
The Company shall advise Parent upon request of the location and whereabouts
of each Company Vessel to facilitate such an inspection.

  

(d) Parent and the Company will hold any information obtained or contemplated
under Sections 5.4(a), (b) and/or (c) above in accordance with the

     

   

provisions of the confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent
**,** dated as of August 3, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  

(e) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective
Representatives made pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth
in this Agreement.

  

Section 5.5 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts **** to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions
precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto, to obtain all
necessary authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings, **** and to obtain the Financing. Each
of the parties hereto will furnish to the other parties such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and, subject to applicable Laws and
any applicable privilege relating to the exchange of information, will
provide the other parties with copies of all filings made by such party with
any Governmental Entity (except for filings available publicly on the SECs
EDGAR system) or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_  that neither party is obligated to share any
document submitted to a Governmental Entity that reflects the negotiations
between the parties or the valuation of some or all of any partys business.

  

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts and shall cooperate with the other
parties to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under the laws, rules, guidelines or
regulations of any Governmental Entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable, file Notification and
Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") and file any voluntary filings or other notifications required to
be filed under (i) the EC Merger Regulation with the European Commission and
(ii) the Exon-Florio Amendment with CFIUS, and in each case shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all
inquiries received from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, the European
Commission or CFIUS for additional information or documentation. Each party
acknowledges that its goal is to file the Notification and Report Forms
within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement and to file the
notifications to be filed under the Exon-Florio Amendment within 20 Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, and that if it does not file such
forms within such period, its senior executives shall discuss the reasons for
the failure to meet such goal with the senior executives from the other
party.

     

   

(c) In case at any time after the Merger I Effective Time any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving Corporation shall take or
cause to be taken all such necessary action.

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts **** to
prevent the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or
injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting consummation of the Mergers.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, none of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II shall be required to accept, as a
condition to obtaining any required approval or resolving any objection of
any Governmental Entity, any requirement to divest or hold separate or in
trust (or the imposition of any other condition or restriction with respect
to) any assets or operations of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or any
of their respective affiliates or any of the respective businesses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Company Assets or the
Company IP Rights, in each case, which constitutes a Burdensome Condition.
"Burdensome Condition" means any requirement, condition or restriction that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other requirements, conditions and
restrictions, is reasonably likely to (i) be materially burdensome to Parent,
(ii) be materially burdensome to the Company, (iii) materially diminish the
value of Parents business or (iv) materially diminish the value of the
Companys business.

  

Section 5.6 _Disclosure Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_.

  

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, the Parent Necessary Corporate
Documents, the Form F-4 and the Form F-6, (ii) in determining whether any
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, or any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained
from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in seeking any
such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Proxy
Statement, the Form F-4 and the Form F-6 and seeking timely to obtain any
such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company may, subject to obtaining the
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), make such reasonable payments and agree to such
reasonable modifications or amendments in order to obtain such consents,
approvals or waivers that are required to be from parties to any material
contracts in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Proxy Statement will be included as part
of the Form F-4. Parent shall file the Form F-4 with the SEC and the "note
dinformation" with the AMF as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that the parties mutual goal
is to file the Form F-4 with the SEC and the "note dinformation" with the
AMF within 45 days after the date of this Agreement, and that if
such documents are not so filed within such period, its senior executives
shall discuss the reasons for the

     

   

failure to meet such goal with the senior executives from the other party.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and the Form F-4 and Form F-6 declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and to keep the Form F-4 and
Form F-6 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Mergers and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies
of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the Parent Necessary Corporate Documents, the
Form F-4 and the Form F-6 received by any Governmental Entity. Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the
Form F-4, all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits or
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby.
The parties shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Parent Necessary Corporate Documents, the Form F-4 or the Form
F-6 prior to filing such documents with any Governmental Entity, and will
provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with any Governmental
Entity. Parent shall pay all expenses incident to the Parent Necessary
Corporate Documents, the Form F-4 and the Form F-6 and state law approvals
(including all SEC and other filing fees and all printing and mailing
expenses associated with the Parent Necessary Corporate Documents, the Form
F-4 and the Form F-6) and the Company shall pay all expenses incident to the
Proxy Statement (including all printing and mailing expenses). If required by
applicable Law, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement, and any
amendment or supplement thereto, to be filed with the applicable Canadian
Governmental Entities concurrently with the mailing of such document to
stockholders of the Company. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form F-4 has been declared
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Depositary Shares (or the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares) issuable in
connection with the First Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction,
and each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly of any
request by any Governmental Entity for amendment of the Proxy Statement, the
Parent Necessary Corporate Documents, the Form F-4 or the Form F-6 or
comments thereon and responses thereto and requests by any Governmental
Entity for additional information.

  

(b) If at any time prior to the Merger I Effective Time, any event or
circumstance relating to the Company, **** Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub
II or any of their respective affiliates, or its or their respective officers
or directors, should be discovered by the Company, **** Parent, Merger Sub I
or Merger Sub II that should be set forth in an amendment to the Form F-4 or
a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company, **** Parent, Merger Sub I
or Merger Sub II shall promptly inform the other parties hereto thereof in
writing. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement,
the Parent Necessary Corporate Documents, the Form F-4 or the Form F-6 shall
be made by Parent or the Company without the consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company, in connection with a Company
Change in Recommendation permitted under Section 5.3, and Parent, in
connection with a Parent Change in Recommendation permitted under Section
5.3, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement, the Parent

     

   

Necessary Corporate Documents, the Form F-4 or the Form F-6 (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such
a change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in this Section
5.6(b) shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or its business, financial condition or results of operations, and
shall be subject to the right of each party to have its board of directors
deliberations and conclusions be accurately described. A "Qualifying
Amendment" means an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
Parent Necessary Corporate Documents, the Form F-4 or the Form F-6 to the
extent it contains (i) a Company Change in Recommendation or a Parent Change
in Recommendation (as the case may be), (ii) a statement of the reasons of
the Company Board or the Board of Directors of Parent (as the case may be)
for making such a Company Change in Recommendation or a Parent Change in
Recommendation (as the case may be) and (iii) additional information
reasonably related to the foregoing, the disclosure of which is required by
Law . All documents that the Company or Parent is responsible for filing with
the SEC or the AMF in connection with the transactions contemplated herein
will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law.

  

(c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take, in accordance
with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, all
action necessary (including the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company) to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders only for the purpose of considering and taking
action upon this Agreement and electing directors if such meeting is held in
conjunction with the Companys regular annual meeting (such meeting,
including any postponement or adjournment thereof, the "Company Special
Meeting"), on a date mutually agreed between the Company and Parent, which
date shall be as soon as practicable and in no event later than 45 days
following the date upon which the Form F-4 becomes effective and the French
"note dinformation" is approved by the AMF. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.3, the Company Board shall (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement
and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its ****
reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption. Notwithstanding
any withdrawal, amendment or modification by the Company Board or any
committee thereof of its recommendation of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 5.3 or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company, or any other fact or circumstance, this Agreement shall be submitted
to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Special Meeting for the
purpose of adopting this Agreement. At any such Company Special
Meeting following any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
Company Boards recommendation of this Agreement, the Company may submit this
Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation or with a negative
recommendation (although the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board
may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative
recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may

     

   

adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting to the extent necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
Company Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at such meeting; _provided_ that no adjournment or postponement may
be to a date on or after three Business Days prior to the Termination Date.

  

(d) Parent, acting through its Board of Directors, shall take, in accordance
with its articles of association and by-laws and with applicable Law, all
action necessary to promptly convene and hold an extraordinary meeting of
its shareholders (such meeting, including any postponement or adjournment
thereof, the "Parent Shareholders Meeting") on a date mutually agreed upon
between the Company and Parent, which date shall be as soon as practicable
and in no event later than 45 days following the date upon which the Form F-4
becomes effective and the French "note dinformation" is approved by the AMF
for the sole purpose of approving the matters constituting the Parent
Shareholder Approval, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Shareholders Meeting to be held on the same day as the Company
Special Meeting. The resolutions proposed at the Parent Shareholders
Meeting, together with all other corporate documents provided by applicable
Law (including expert reports, if required) (the "Parent Necessary Corporate
Documents "), shall be sufficient for the valid approval of the issuance of
the Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with this Agreement. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.3, the Parent Board shall (i) recommend
approval of the matters constituting the Parent Shareholder Approval and
include in the Parent Necessary Corporate Documents such recommendation and
(ii) use its reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain such approval.
In connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting, Parent will use
its reasonable best efforts, subject to the immediately preceding sentence,
to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval and will otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to the Parent Shareholders Meeting. Parent
shall promptly take any action required to be taken under foreign or state
securities or blue sky laws in connection with the issuance of Parent
Depositary Shares (and the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares) in connection
with the First Merger. Notwithstanding any withdrawal, amendment
or modification by the Board of Directors of Parent of its recommendation of
the Parent Shareholder Approval in accordance with Section 5.3 or the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent
of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, or any other fact or
circumstance, this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Parent
at the Parent Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of approving the matters
constituting the Parent Shareholder Approval. At any such Parent
Shareholders Meeting following any such withdrawal, amendment
or modification of the recommendation of Parents Board of Directors, Parent
may submit matters constituting the Parent Shareholder Approval to its
shareholders without a recommendation or with a negative recommendation
(although the approval of the matters constituting the Parent Shareholder
Approval by the Board of Directors of Parent may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Parent may communicate the
basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative recommendation to its
shareholders in the Parent Necessary Corporate

     

   

Documents or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent may adjourn or
postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Parent Necessary Corporate
Documents is provided to Parents shareholders or, if as of the time for
which the Parent Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Parent Necessary Corporate Documents) there are insufficient Parent
Ordinary Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting; _provided_ that no
adjournment or postponement may be to a date on or after three Business Days
prior to the Termination Date.

  

(e) The information supplied by the Company, **** Parent, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates **** for inclusion in the
Form F-4 shall not, at the time the Form F-4 is declared effective, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. The information supplied by the Company, ****
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at the date the Proxy
Statement (or any supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of
the Company, at the time of the Company Special Meeting, at the time of the
Parent Stockholders Meeting or at the Merger I Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The information supplied by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates for inclusion in the
Parent Necessary Corporate Documents shall not, at the date the "note
dinformation" is approved by the AMF or at the time the Parent Necessary
Corporate Documents are delivered or put at the disposal of the shareholders
of Parent, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Merger I Effective Time,
any event or circumstance relating to the Company, **** Parent, Merger Sub I
or Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates, or its or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company, ****
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II that should be set forth in an
amendment to the Form F-4 or a supplement to the Proxy Statement or the "note
dinformation," the Company, **** Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II shall
promptly inform the other parties hereto thereof in writing.

  

(f) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent,
as the owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, will adopt this Agreement in its capacity as
sole stockholder of each of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II.  Promptly
following the Merger I Effective Time, Parent, as the owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Merger I Surviving Corporation,
will adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger I
Surviving Corporation.

     

   

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company, on one
hand, and Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, on the other hand, shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
such party that is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to such party, to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on such party.

  

Section 5.8 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

  

(a) After the Merger I Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries in such capacities ("Indemnified Parties") to the
fullest extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would have been
required to do so in accordance with the provisions of each indemnification
or similar agreement or arrangement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party (but in no event shall such
indemnification be required to the extent prohibited by applicable Law), in
each case against any losses, damages, fines, penalties, expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) or liabilities resulting from any claim,
liability, loss, damage, cost or expense, asserted against, or incurred by,
an Indemnified Party that is based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is
or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under any Company Plans and arising out of
actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions in their capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under any Company Plan occurring at or prior to
the Merger I Effective Time (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall,
jointly and severally, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any such Claim to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law) and (ii) take all necessary actions to ensure that
Parents directors and officers liability insurance continues to cover each
officer and director of the Company, in each case so long as they remain
employed or retained by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including the
Surviving Corporation) as an officer or director and, to the extent Parents
current directors and officers liability insurance policy covers
consultants, as a consultant, on terms that are no less favorable than
those enjoyed by Parents other directors and officers. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to exculpation, advancement of
expenses and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Merger I Effective Time now existing in favor of the current and former
officers and directors of the Company as provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any Company Material Contract, in
each case in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Mergers and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and
without amendment thereof.

  

(b) Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section
5.8 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from
the Merger I Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation ("Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Claim. In the event that Parent or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such

     

   

consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section 5.8
are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
respective Indemnified Parties and their heirs and representatives.

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase and fully prepay, and
after the Merger I Effective Time Parent shall maintain, tail directors and
officers liability insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier covering,
with a claims period of six years from the Merger I Effective Time, with
respect to the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
are currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred before the Merger I Effective Time, in an amount and scope and on
terms and conditions no less favorable to such directors and officers than
those in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the aggregate premium for such insurance shall not exceed 200% of the per
annum rate of premium currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for
such insurance on the date of this Agreement per policy year of coverage. In
the event that the aggregate premium for such insurance exceeds such maximum
amount, Parent shall purchase as much coverage per policy year as reasonably
obtainable for such maximum amount.

  

Section 5.9 _Publicity_.  None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to
the Mergers, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior consultation of the other party, except as
may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with, or regulation of,
any U.S. or foreign securities exchange or regulatory authority if all
reasonable best efforts have been made to consult with the other party. In
addition, the Company shall to the extent reasonably practicable consult with
Parent regarding the form and content of any public disclosure of any
material developments or matters involving the Company, including earnings
releases, reasonably in advance of publication or release.

  

Section 5.10 _Financing_. (a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain and effectuate the Financing. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all material
developments concerning the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter.
Without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not amend or
alter, or agree to amend or alter, the Commitment Letter in any manner that
would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letter.

  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, employees, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its advisors and accountants to, provide reasonable and
customary cooperation with

     

   

Parent and its affiliates in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
and any other financing that Parent, in its reasonable discretion, deems
necessary to fund the transaction, including participation in meetings, due
diligence sessions, road shows, rating agency presentations, the preparation
of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses, rating
agency presentations, other marketing material and similar documents,
obtaining comfort letters from the Companys accountants (which comfort
letters shall be customary in form, scope and substance), and obtaining legal
opinions from the Companys outside counsel (which legal opinions shall be
customary in form, scope and substance), as may be reasonably requested by
Parent. In conjunction with the obtaining of any such financing, the Company
agrees, at the reasonable request of Parent, to call for prepayment or
redemption, or to prepay or redeem, or to attempt to renegotiate the terms
of, any then existing indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to make or
cause to become effective such prepayment or redemption or call for
prepayment or redemption or renegotiated terms (nor shall the Company be
required to incur any liability in respect of any such prepayment
or redemption or call therefor or renegotiation thereof) prior to the Merger
I Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and other
representatives from and against any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by them (including any expenses incurred) in connection with any
such call for prepayment or redemption, or prepayment or redemption or
renegotiation done by the Company at the request of Parent.

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur
any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing prior to
the Merger I Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and
other representatives for and against any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by them (including any expenses incurred) in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information (other than information
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries provided by the Company to Parent
for use in any information memoranda or marketing materials) utilized in
connection therewith or in connection with the actions taken pursuant to this
Section 5.10.

  

Section 5.11 _Stock Exchange Listing_.  Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (a) cause the Parent Depositary Shares (and, if required, the
underlying Parent Ordinary Shares) to be issued in connection with the First
Merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance and
(b) obtain the approval (visa) of the AMF on the prospectus relating to the
Parent Ordinary Shares and the approval of Euronext Paris SA to the listing
of the Parent Ordinary Shares, in each case to be issued at the Merger I
Effective Time (so that the listing of the Parent Ordinary Shares takes place
at the Merger I Effective Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter) as part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to official
notice of issuance.

  

Section 5.12 _Employee Benefits_. (a) Subject to Sections 1.8 and 5.17,
during the period from the Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof,
Parent shall, or

     

   

shall cause its affiliates to, continue, for each Person who is employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger I
Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees"), the compensation (including but
not limited to cash compensation and incentive and bonus opportunities, but
excluding equity-based compensation), benefits (including but not limited to
employee welfare benefit plans and vacation, paid time-off and severance) and
similar plans as such compensation arrangements and plans were in effect
immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Parent may amend, supplement or replace any such plan, policy or
program if, in the good faith judgment of management of Parent, any such
amendment, supplement or replacement will provide the Continuing Employees
covered thereby with benefits under such plan, policy or program, as amended,
supplemented or replaced, that are in the aggregate at least as valuable as
the benefits to be received under such plan, policy or program, as
applicable, as in effect immediately prior to any such amendment, supplement
or replacement.

  

(b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the Merger I Effective
Time shall be treated as service with Parent and its affiliates for purposes
of each Parent Plan (including but not limited to employee welfare benefit
plans and vacation, paid time-off and severance plans or policies) in which
such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after the Merger I
Effective Time, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
levels and accruals (other than defined benefit pension plan accruals).

  

(c) Following the Merger I Effective Time, for purposes of each Parent Plan
in which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is
eligible to participate after the Merger I Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause its affiliates to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition,
exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period to the extent such
condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Plan as of the Merger I Effective Time (or, if
later, any applicable plan transition date) and (ii) provide full credit for
any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to
the Merger I Effective Time for the plan year in which the Merger I Effective
Time (or such transition date) occurs.

  

(d) In the event that on or within 12 months following the Closing Date (i)
the employment of a Continuing Employee who is employed by the Company or an
affiliate of the Company in the United States (a "US Continuing Employee") is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an affiliate of
either other than for Cause as defined under the Severance Policy (as defined
below) or under other circumstances entitling the US Continuing Employee to
severance benefits under the terms of the Severance Policy, or (ii) the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or an affiliate of either fails to provide a US
Continuing Company Employee with at least the same level of compensation and
benefits as were in effect immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time
in accordance with the requirements of Section 5.12(a), Parent shall
be responsible for and shall pay, or cause its affiliate to pay, to such
US Continuing Employee, in a lump sum payment, the amount of severance
benefits and COBRA reimbursement payments (the "Severance Benefits") that is
determined for such US

   

80   

 

  

Continuing Employee in accordance with the terms of the Veritas DGC, Inc.
Severance Policy (the "Severance Policy" ), a copy of which is included in
Section 5.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, not later than thirty (30)
days following the date of such US Continuing Employees termination of
employment or, if such payment is required to be delayed by Section 409A, the
date that is six months following such US Continuing Employees "separation
from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. The obligation
to provide the Severance Benefits shall be subject to the US Continuing
Employees executing a release of all claims against the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and their respective
affiliates, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation.
 Severance benefits for Continuing Employees who are not US
Continuing Employees shall be determined in accordance with applicable Law.

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any
of its Affiliates to employ any Continuing Employee for any length of time
following the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall be construed to prevent Parent or its affiliates from (i) terminating,
or modifying the terms of employment of, any Continuing Employee following
the Closing Date or (ii) terminating or modifying to any extent any Company
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
that Parent or its affiliates may establish or maintain;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent that, and for so long as, a Continuing
Employee remains employed by Parent or any of its affiliates during the
twelve month period following the Closing Date, the compensation and benefits
payable to such employee during such period shall be subject to
the provisions of this Section 5.12.

  

Section 5.13 _Appointment of Directors_. Parent shall take all necessary
corporate action to increase the size of the Parent Board by up to five
members and to appoint the Company Directors immediately following the Merger
I Effective Time to fill the vacancies on the Parent Board created by such
increase. Parent, through the Parent Board and subject to the Parent Boards
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Parent, shall take all necessary
action to recommend that the Company Directors be elected to the Parent Board
in the circular of Parent relating to the first annual meeting of the
shareholders of Parent following the Closing.

  

Section 5.14 _Rights Agreement_. The Company Board shall take such action
as is necessary to terminate the Company Rights Agreement and the Company
Rights immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time and to render the
Company Rights inapplicable to the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 5.15 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Mergers to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of

     

   

Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in
Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d) and to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service under Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(9) to the effect that
the Mergers will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code (the "IRS
Ruling").

  

(c) Parent and the Company shall jointly cooperate in connection with the
Companys request for the IRS Ruling and shall promptly provide all
information in connection with the IRS Ruling request.  The preparation of
the IRS Ruling request, and any oral or written communication with the
Internal Revenue Service, shall be conducted jointly by the Company and
Parent.

  

(d) Neither Parent nor the Company will take or fail to take (and, following
the Mergers, Parent will cause the Company not to take or fail to take) any
action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to (i)
cause the Mergers to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) cause the stockholders of the Company
to recognize gain pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, other than any
such stockholder that would be a "five-percent transferee shareholder" of
Parent (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) following the Mergers that does not enter into a five-
year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-8(b). With respect to the Mergers, Parent will (and
following the Mergers will cause the Company to) file all required
information with its Tax Returns and maintain all records required for Tax
purposes, including, without limitation, the reporting requirements contained
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

  

(e) Parent will make arrangements with each five-percent transferee
shareholder, as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii),
if any, to ensure that such shareholder will be informed of any disposition
of any property that would require the recognition of gain under such
Persons gain recognition agreement entered into under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a).

  

(f) Officers of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company shall
execute and deliver to Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., tax counsel for the Company,
and Skadden Arps, tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in the
form agreed to by the parties and such law firms at such time or times as may
reasonably be requested by such law firms, including contemporaneously with
the execution of this Agreement, at the time the Form F-4 is declared
effective by the SEC and the Merger I Effective Time, in connection with such
tax counsels respective delivery of opinions pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) and
6.3(d) hereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any
action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be
taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications
and representations included in the certificates described in this Section
5.15(f).

  

(g) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock

     

   

transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration and other
fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the First
Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Merger I
Effective Time.  Each of Merger Sub I and the Company shall pay, without
deduction from any amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock and
without reimbursement from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on
it by any Governmental Entity (or for which its stockholders are primarily
liable), which becomes payable in connection with the First Merger.

  

Section 5.16 _Supplemental Indenture_. If the Company Convertible Debt is
not converted prior to the Merger I Effective Time, Parent shall assume the
Company Convertible Debt in accordance with its terms at the Merger I
Effective Time by executing a supplemental indenture in accordance with the

Bank National Association, as trustee.

  

Section 5.17 _ESPP_. Any "Offering Period" (as defined in the ESPP) that
began on or prior to the date hereof under the ESPP may continue through the
earlier of the date on which it is currently expected to expire in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP in effect on the date hereof and the end of the
last Business Day before the Merger I Effective Time; _provided_ , (a) no
person shall be allowed to elect to increase his or her payroll deductions or
other contributions to purchase Company Common Stock for such Offering Period
after the date hereof; and (b) the Company shall not commence any new
Offering Periods under the ESPP on or after the date hereof.  Prior to the
Merger I Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all actions necessary
to cause the ESPP to be terminated effective as of the earlier of the last
day of the Offering Period that is underway as of the date hereof or the last
Business Day prior to the Merger I Effective Time.

  

Section 5.18 _Investigation by Parties; No Other Representations or
Warranties_.

  

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own
inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent
judgment concerning, the other party hereto and their respective Subsidiaries
and their businesses and operations, and each of Parent, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, has
requested such documents and information from the other party as each such
party considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company acknowledges and agrees
that it has had an opportunity to ask all questions of and receive answers
from the other parties hereto with respect to any matter such party considers
material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In connection
with such investigation, each of the parties hereto and their representatives
have received certain other estimates, projections and other forecasts for
the other parties hereto and certain estimates, plans and budget information.
Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that there

     

   

are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans and budgets; that such parties are familiar with such
uncertainties; that such parties are taking full responsibility for making
their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them or their
representatives; and that such parties will not (and will cause all of their
respective Subsidiaries or other affiliates or any other Person acting
on their behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action against the
other parties hereto or any of their direct or indirect partners,
directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, affiliates,
consultants, counsel, accountants, investment bankers or representatives with
respect thereto, or hold any such Person liable with respect thereto.

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto agree that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Articles III and IV of this Agreement, no
party hereto has made and shall not be deemed to have made any representation
or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company agrees that none
of the other parties hereto, nor any of their respective affiliates or
representatives, makes or has made any representation or warranty with
respect to:

  

(i) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of such other party or any of
its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of such other
party or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made
available to the other parties hereto or their respective representatives or
affiliates; or

  

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to the other parties hereto or their
respective representatives or affiliates, except to the extent and as
expressly covered by a representation and warranty contained in Article III
or IV of this Agreement.

  

Section 5.19 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company, and their respective Boards of Directors, shall use their reasonable
best efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-Action
Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP.

  

Section 5.20 _Affiliates Letter_. Prior to the date of the Company Special
Meeting, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and addresses of

     

   

those Persons who are, in the opinion of the Company, as of the time of the
Company Special Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall provide to Parent
such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for
purposes of reviewing such list. There shall be added to such list the names
and addresses of any other Person subsequently identified by either Parent or
the Company as a Person who may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Person identified by Parent
shall be added to the list of affiliates of the Company if Parent shall
receive from the Company, on or before the date of the Company Special
Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the
effect that such Person is not such an affiliate. The Company shall exercise
its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to
Parent, prior to the date of the Company Special Meeting, from each affiliate
of the Company identified in the foregoing list (as the same may be
supplemented as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the Closing Date
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Affiliates Letter").
Parent shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the Form F-4 or
any other registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of
resale of Parent Depositary Shares (or the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying
such Parent Depositary Shares) by such affiliates received pursuant to the
First Merger and Parent may direct the Exchange Agent not to issue
certificates representing Parent Depositary Shares (or the Parent Ordinary
Shares underlying such Parent Depositary Shares) received by any such
affiliate until Parent has received from such Person an Affiliates Letter.
Parent may issue certificates representing Parent Depositary Shares (or the
Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such Parent Depositary Shares) received by
such affiliates bearing a customary legend regarding applicable Securities
Act restrictions and the provisions of this Section 5.20.

  

Section 5.21 _Merger Subs_.

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall (i)
cause to be formed and organized Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II as wholly
owned subsidiaries of Parent incorporated under the laws of Delaware

to this Agreement which shall be done by each of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub
II executing and delivering a copy of this Agreement to each of the Company
and Parent and (iii) cause each of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to take
all necessary action to complete the transactions contemplated hereby subject
to the terms and conditions hereof.

  

(b) Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are being formed solely for the purpose of
effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Merger Sub I
and Merger Sub II shall not (and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II to) conduct any business or acquire any assets (other than as
contemplated by this Agreement) prior to the Merger II Effective Time.

II to Effect the Mergers_.

  

The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to effect the
Mergers are further subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing
Date of each of the following conditions (any or all of which may be waived
by Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II in writing, in whole or in part, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law):

  

(a) (i) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Sections 3.2(a) and (b) and 3.3 shall be true and correct both when made and
at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
date); _provided_  that for purposes of this clause (i), the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.2(a) shall not be deemed
untrue and incorrect due to the failure, if any, of the Company to disclose
the existence as of the Cut-off Time of up to 3,000 shares in the aggregate
of any combination of Company Common Stock and/or options or rights to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2(a) and (b) and 3.3)
shall be true and correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date,
as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of
an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set
forth therein) individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.  Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by each of two senior executive officers of the Company to the
foregoing effect;

  

(b) The Company shall have performed or complied with in all material
respects each of its obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to
the terms of this

     

   

Agreement, and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
the Company by each of two senior executive officers of the Company to the
foregoing effect;

  

(c) There shall not be pending any suit, action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity seeking to (i) prohibit or limit in any respect the
ownership or operation by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
or any of their respective affiliates of any portion of the business or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or to require any such Person to
dispose of or hold separate any portion of the business or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any such case which would
constitute a Burdensome Condition, or (ii) restrain, preclude, enjoin or
prohibit the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  

(d) Parent shall have received the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP ("Skadden Arps"), counsel to Parent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, dated the Closing Date, rendered on the
basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion and
the certificates obtained from officers of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub
II and the Company, all of which are consistent with the state of facts
existing as of the Merger I Effective Time, to the effect that the Mergers
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. In rendering the opinion described in this Section 6.3(d), Skadden Arps
shall have received and may rely upon the certificates and representations
referred to in Section 5.15(f) hereof;

  

(e) Each of the approvals described in Section 6.1(c) and (d) shall have been
obtained without the imposition of any condition or restriction which
constitutes a Burdensome Condition; and

  

(f) At or prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States ("CFIUS") shall have notified Parent in
writing that it has determined not to investigate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers) pursuant to the powers
vested in it by Section 5021 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of
1988, which amended Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 ("Exon-
Florio Amendment") or, in the event that CFIUS has undertaken such an
investigation, CFIUS has terminated such investigation or the President of
the United States has determined not to take any action or, in the event that
CFIUS or the President of the United States has requested Parent to modify
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers) or
otherwise enter into any other commitment to protect the National Security of
the United States, as determined by the Exon Florio Amendment, such
modification or commitment would not reasonably be expected to constitute a
Burdensome Condition.

(c) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any

(a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time
before or after approval by the stockholders of the Company of the matters
presented in connection with the First Merger, but after any such approval no
amendment shall be made without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company if such amendment alters or changes (i) the Merger Consideration,
(ii) any term of the articles of association or by-laws of Parent or (iii)

adversely affect the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company.

parties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto by the other party or (iii) waive in whole or in part
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Any such waiver shall constitute a
waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the parties
hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions,
to enforce any

     

   

of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege
hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a
similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or
privileges hereunder.  The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative
and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any
party may otherwise have at Law or in equity.

Agreement or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as
of the Merger I Effective Time shall survive until (but not beyond) the

Agreement, nor any director, officer, employee, representative, agent or
other controlling Person of each of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective affiliates shall have any liability or obligation arising under

that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this

and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (and each
agrees that no such claim, suit, action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its affiliates except in such
court), and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in any such claim, suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding. Each of the parties hereto further agree that, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice
or document in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding may be served on
any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction
of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
