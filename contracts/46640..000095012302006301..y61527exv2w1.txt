and in accordance with the NYBCL and the DGCL, at the Effective Time: (i) Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into Spinco, the separate existence of Merger Sub

stock of Del Monte or Spinco:

            (a) Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.2(b)) shall be automatically converted into the right

Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The "Exchange Ratio" shall equal 745/255

for Spinco Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Del Monte Average and
(ii) the Exchange Ratio) immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Exchange
Ratio shall be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Del Monte
Common Stock.

            The "Del Monte Average" shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing
(i) the sum of (A) the closing price of Del Monte Common Stock on the NYSE on
the date of this


                                       16
<PAGE>
Agreement and (B) the average of the closing prices of Del Monte Common Stock on
the NYSE for the 30 trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date by (ii) two.

            (b) Each share of Spinco Common Stock held by Spinco as treasury

a certificate representing the shares of Del Monte Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2, the amount of dividends or other
distributions thereon with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date prior to the delivery of such shares by the Exchange Agent and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Del Monte Common Stock payable in accordance with
Section 2.8(d), without interest.

been abandoned and this Agreement terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, the
closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the

last of the conditions set forth in Article 8 is satisfied or waived (except for
those conditions that, by the express terms thereof, are not capable of being

those conditions) (the "Closing Date"), or at such other time and place as Heinz
and Del Monte shall agree in writing; provided, however, that the Parties shall
consult as to whether it would be advisable to defer the Closing until the last
day of the accounting month of either Heinz or Del Monte next following the date
on which such conditions are satisfied.

            2.5 Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable at or after the Closing, (i) a
certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the

provided in the Delaware Certificate of Merger and the New York Certificate of
Merger. The date and time at which the Merger shall so become effective is
herein referred to as the "Effective Time."

            2.6 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 906 of the NYBCL and Section 259 of the DGCL.

            2.7 Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of Spinco shall be closed and no transfer shall be made
of any shares of capital stock of Spinco that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

            2.8 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than five (5) business days
after the Closing Date), Del Monte shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the Heinz shareholders as of the Heinz Record Date and for the
purpose of exchanging the Distribution Stock Certificate for certificates
representing that number of shares of Del Monte Common Stock that are to be
issued in the Merger in accordance with this Article 2, certificates
representing the shares of Del Monte Common Stock (such shares of Del Monte
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions thereon having a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to the delivery of
such shares by the Exchange Agent and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Del Monte Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.8(d), being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 2.2
in exchange for outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock. The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver to the Heinz shareholders
as of the Heinz Record Date the Del Monte Common Stock contemplated to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.2 from the shares of stock held in the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Del Monte shall deliver
all such dividends referred to above to the Exchange Agent. Heinz shareholders
shall not be entitled to receive interest on any funds in the Exchange Fund.

            (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Del Monte shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to
the Heinz shareholders as of the Heinz Record Date (i) certificates representing
the number of whole shares of Del Monte Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this Article 2 (and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Del Monte Common Stock, as contemplated by Section 2.8(d)) and (ii)
the amount of dividends and other distributions, if any, with a record date
after the Effective Time which theretofore became payable with respect to such
shares of Del Monte Common Stock, and the Distribution Stock Certificate shall
forthwith be cancelled. Del Monte shall be entitled, and may instruct the
Exchange Agent, to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any provision of
U.S., state or local or foreign tax law. Any withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Heinz
shareholder.


                                       18
<PAGE>
            (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Spinco Common Stock. All shares
of Del Monte Common Stock issued pursuant to Sections 2.8(a) and (b) and any
cash paid pursuant to Section 2.8(d) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Spinco Common Stock
converted in the Merger in accordance with Section 2.2.

            (d) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Del Monte
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, and, to the extent the Exchange
Ratio would result in any Heinz shareholder as of the Heinz Record Date being
entitled to receive a fractional share of Del Monte Common Stock, such
fractional share interests will not entitle any such shareholder to vote or to
any rights as a stockholder of Del Monte. All fractional interests in Del Monte
Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable as a result of the Merger shall be
aggregated and if a fractional interest results from such aggregation, the
holder otherwise entitled thereto shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof,
an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the closing sale price per share
of Del Monte Common Stock on the NYSE on the business day preceding the
Effective Time, if the stock is being traded on such date, or if the stock is
not being traded on such date, the closing sale price per share of Del Monte
Common Stock on the NYSE on the first business day that such stock is traded, by
(ii) the fraction of a share of Del Monte Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise have been entitled. Del Monte shall timely make available to the
Exchange Agent any cash necessary to make payments in lieu of fractional shares
as aforesaid. Alternatively, Del Monte shall have the option of instructing the
Exchange Agent to aggregate all fractional interests in Del Monte Common Stock
resulting from the Merger, sell shares representing such aggregate interests in
the public market and distribute to the Heinz shareholders as of the Heinz
Record Date who otherwise would have been entitled to fractional shares a pro
rata portion of the proceeds of such sale.

            (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Del Monte Common Stock made
available to the Exchange Agent that remains undistributed on the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Del Monte, upon demand,
and any Heinz shareholder as of the Heinz Record Date shall thereafter look only
to Del Monte for payment of their claim for Del Monte Common Stock and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Del Monte Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Del Monte Common Stock.

            (f) No Liability. Neither Del Monte nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any Heinz shareholder as of the Heinz Record Date or any
holder of shares of Del Monte Common Stock for shares of Del Monte Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or with respect to Spinco
Common Stock) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Del Monte Common Stock
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

accordance with the terms of the Del Monte 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, the Del
Monte 1998 Stock Incentive Plan and the Non-Employee Directors and Independent

action necessary to ensure that each option to acquire shares of Del Monte
Common Stock and each other incentive award granted to an employee, officer or
director of Del

Agreement, become vested or exercisable.

            (b) (i) In accordance with the terms of the Heinz 1994 Stock Option
Plan, the Heinz 1996 Stock Option Plan and the Heinz 2000 Stock Option Plan and
any other stock option or stock incentive compensation plan for employees,
officers, or directors of Heinz, as amended (collectively, the "Heinz Stock
Plans"), each option to acquire shares of Heinz Common Stock (each, a "Heinz
Option") granted to a Spinco Employee under the Heinz Stock Plans and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, be adjusted, pursuant to the Heinz Stock Plans, into a Heinz
Option on Heinz Common Stock (as in existence after the spin-off of Spinco) and
an option to purchase Spinco Common Stock (a "Spinco Option") in accordance with
the Employee Benefits Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Heinz Stock
Plans, the Board of Directors (or any committee) of Heinz shall take any action
necessary to ensure that each Heinz Option that is to be adjusted into a Spinco
Option as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence (and converted into a
Del Monte Option as set forth below) and that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall not, as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, become vested or exercisable.

                  (ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Heinz shall, or Heinz
      shall cause Spinco to, take all action necessary such that each Spinco
      Option which remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
      shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Spinco Common Stock,
      and at the Effective Time each such Spinco Option shall be converted into
      a right to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
      under the Spinco Option prior to the Effective Time, that number of shares
      of Del Monte Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares
      of Spinco Common Stock subject to such Spinco Option by the Exchange
      Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Del Monte
      Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
      of a cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Spinco
      Option divided by the Exchange Ratio. All Spinco Options, once converted
      into options on Del Monte Common Stock, shall hereinafter be referred to
      as "Del Monte Options."

            (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, (i) Del Monte
shall deliver to the holders of Del Monte Options appropriate notices setting
forth such holders' rights thereunder (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include the rights such holders had pursuant to the applicable Heinz Stock Plans
under which the Heinz Options (adjusted into Del Monte Options) were originally
granted), and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Del Monte Options
shall contain the same terms and conditions as in effect prior to the Effective
Time (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.9 after giving
effect to the Merger, the Employee Benefits Agreement and the terms of the Heinz
Stock Plans) and (ii) Heinz shall deliver to the holders of Heinz Options (as
adjusted) appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights thereunder
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the rights such holders had
pursuant to the applicable Heinz Plans under which the Heinz Options were
originally granted), and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Heinz
Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as in effect
prior to the Effective Time


                                       20
<PAGE>

the Merger, the Employee Benefits Agreement, and the terms of the Heinz Stock
Plans).

shares of Spinco Common Stock held by Spinco Employees pursuant to the Heinz
Restricted Stock Bonus Plan shall be treated in accordance with the terms of
Section 2.2 of this Agreement ("Restricted Stock") and, thereafter, shall be
treated in accordance with the terms of the other Transaction Agreements.

            (e) On or prior to the Effective Time, Del Monte shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares
of Del Monte Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Del Monte Options in
accordance with this Section 2.9. Prior to the Effective Time, Del Monte shall
take all corporate action necessary such that, at the Effective Time, Del Monte
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the Del Monte
Options (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the
shares of Del Monte Common Stock subject to such Del Monte Options and, after
the Effective Time, Del Monte shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain current the
status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Del Monte
Options remain outstanding.

            Except as set forth in the Spinco Disclosure Letter, Heinz and
Spinco, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Del Monte as follows and
in each case after giving effect to the Contribution and the Distribution
(unless otherwise explicitly stated):

carry on its business as presently conducted and is or will be at the Effective
Time duly qualified and licensed to do business and is or will be at the
Effective Time in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or
leasing of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified
or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. Copies of
the Spinco certificate of incorporation and bylaws in existence on the date
hereof are included as part of Section 4.1 of the Spinco Disclosure Letter and
are complete and correct and in full force and effect on the date hereof. Each
of the Spinco Subsidiaries is or will be at the Effective Time a corporation or
(as indicated in Section 4.1 of the Spinco Disclosure Letter) other legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept or similar
concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of
the state or other jurisdiction of its incorporation or other organization, has
or will have at the Effective Time all requisite power and authority to own or
lease and operate and use its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and is or will be duly qualified and licensed to do
business and is or will be at the Effective Time in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its property or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which the
failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not, individually or

Spinco.

            4.2 Capital Stock and Other Matters. (a) The authorized capital
stock of Spinco consists of 1,000 shares of Spinco Common Stock, all of which

in its treasury and (iii) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of

Voting Debt") will be issued or outstanding. All outstanding shares of Spinco
Common Stock are, and all shares thereof which may be issued will be, when

contains a true and complete list of each entity that will be a material
Subsidiary of Spinco at the Effective Time, including its jurisdiction of
organization, Spinco's interest therein and a brief description of the principal
line or lines of business conducted by each such material Subsidiary. All the

wholly-owned Subsidiary of Spinco or by Spinco and another wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Spinco, free and clear of all Liens and are duly authorized,

would not result in a material liability to Spinco, all contributions required
to be made with respect to any Spinco Benefit Plan have been timely made. There
are no pending or, to Heinz's Knowledge, threatened claims by, on behalf of or
against any of the Spinco Benefit Plans or any assets thereof, other than
routine claims for benefits under such plans, that, if adversely determined
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Spinco and no matter is pending (other than


                                       30
<PAGE>
routine qualification determination filings, copies of which have been furnished
to Del Monte or will be promptly furnished to Del Monte when made) with respect
to any of the Spinco Benefit Plans before the IRS, the United States Department
of Labor or the PBGC, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

            (e) Each Spinco Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from
the IRS stating that they and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from
taxation under Section 401(a) or Section 501(a) of the Code, respectively, and
each trust maintained under any Spinco Benefit Plan intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such requirements,
and in any such case, no event has occurred or condition is known to exist that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such tax-qualified status for
any such Spinco Benefit Plan or any such trust.

            (f) Except as otherwise provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Separation Agreement shall
not result, by itself or with the passage of time, in the payment or
acceleration of any amount, the accrual or acceleration of any benefit or any
increase in any vested interest or entitlement to any benefit or payment by any
employee, officer or director under domestic or foreign law that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Spinco.

            4.13 Labor Matters. (a) Except as would not, in the case of clauses
(i)(B), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco (i) neither Spinco nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any (A) collective
bargaining agreement or (B) other Contract with a labor union or labor
organization, nor is any such Contract presently being negotiated; (ii) neither
Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any proceeding asserting
that Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or
seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or
conditions of employment, nor, to Heinz's Knowledge, is such proceeding
threatened; (iii) there is no strike, work stoppage, lockout or other labor
dispute involving Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to Heinz's
Knowledge, threatened; (iv) there have been no claims initiated by any labor
organization to represent any employees of Spinco not currently represented by a
labor organization within the past five years, nor, to Heinz's Knowledge, are
there any campaigns being conducted to solicit cards from employees to authorize
representation by any labor organization; and (v) Spinco and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with its obligations pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended ("WARN"), and all other
notification and bargaining obligations arising under any collective bargaining
agreement, statute or otherwise.

            (b) Spinco is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable U.S. and non-U.S. laws relating to employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, and the employment of former, current, and prospective
employees, independent contractors and "leased employees" (within the meaning of
Section 414(n) of the Code) of Spinco including all such U.S. and non-U.S. laws,
agreements and contracts relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining,
employment discrimination, immigration, disability, civil rights, human rights,
fair


                                       31
<PAGE>
labor standards, occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, pay
equity, wrongful discharge and violation of the potential rights of such former,
current, and prospective employees, independent contractors and leased
employees, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

            4.14 Intellectual Property Matters. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco, (i) Spinco or its Subsidiaries own all right, title,
and interest in, or otherwise control or have the right to use all the
Intellectual Property (which for purposes of this Section 4.14 shall be deemed
not to include Data Communications Infrastructure) that is necessary to carry on
the business of Spinco and its Subsidiaries substantially as currently conducted
(including in connection with services provided by Spinco and its Subsidiaries
to third parties), free of all Liens; (ii) no Action or Ruling is pending or, to
Heinz's Knowledge, is threatened by any Person with respect to any Intellectual
Property owned or used by Spinco or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Spinco Business ("Spinco Business IP") or that alleges that any Spinco Business
IP infringes, impairs, dilutes or otherwise violates ("Infringes") the rights of
others and Spinco is not subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order,
decree, ruling, charge, settlement, or other dispute involving any third party
Intellectual Property; (iii) to Heinz's Knowledge, all of the material Spinco
Business IP is valid and enforceable, does not Infringe the rights of others and
is not being Infringed by others; and (iv) there are no unpaid maintenance or
renewal fees currently overdue for any of the Spinco Business IP, nor have any
material applications or registrations therefor lapsed or been abandoned,
cancelled, or expired otherwise than in the ordinary course of business.

            4.15 Material Contracts. Neither Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or bound by (a) any "material contract" as defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC (the term "material contract" to be
applied as if Spinco were a separate company for the purpose of this Section
4.15) or any agreement, contract or commitment that would be such a "material
contract" but for the exception for contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business or (b) any non-competition agreement or any other agreement
or obligation that materially limits or will materially limit Spinco or any of
its Subsidiaries from engaging in the Spinco Business. Each of the "material
contracts" (as defined above) of Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries is valid and
in full force and effect and neither Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries has
violated any provisions of, or committed or failed to perform any act that, with
or without prejudice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under
the provisions of any such "material contract".

            4.16 Board Approval. The Boards of Directors of Heinz and Spinco, in
each case, at a meeting duly called and held, have unanimously approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable.

            4.17 Vote Required. The affirmative vote of Heinz, as the sole
stockholder of Spinco, is the only vote of the shareholders of Heinz or the
stockholders of Spinco necessary to adopt this Agreement. Upon such adoption,
the approval of Spinco's stockholders after the Distribution Date will not be
required to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The approval
of Heinz's shareholders is not required to effect the transactions contemplated
by the Separation Agreement, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

to which Heinz and Spinco make no representation and (ii) the Excluded Assets
referred to in clauses (i) through (xii) of Section 2.01(b) of the Separation
Agreement and after giving effect to the transactions described in or
contemplated by the Separation Agreement and the services to be provided
pursuant to the other Transaction Agreements, the Spinco Assets will, at the
Effective Time, constitute those assets reasonably required to operate the
Spinco Business in all material respects as it is currently conducted.

             (b) After the Contribution, Spinco or one of its Subsidiaries will
have good, valid and marketable title to, or in the case of leased properties
and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of the tangible Spinco Assets
except where the failure to have such good, valid and marketable title or valid
leasehold interests would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco, in each case subject to no
Liens, except for (i) Liens reflected in the Audited Statements, (ii) Liens
consisting of zoning or planning restrictions, easements, permits and other
restrictions or limitations on the use of real property or irregularities in
title thereto which do not materially detract from the value of, or materially
impair the use of, such property as it is presently used in connection with the
Spinco Business, (iii) Liens for current Taxes, assessments or governmental
charges or levies on property not yet due or which are being contested in good
faith and for which appropriate reserves in accordance with GAAP have been
created, (iv) mechanic's, materialmen's and similar Liens arising in the
ordinary course of business or by operation of law, (v) any conditions that are
shown on the surveys previously delivered to Del Monte of such real property and
(vi) Liens which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

            (c) Section 4.18 of the Spinco Disclosure Letter lists all material
services currently provided to Spinco or any Spinco Subsidiary by Heinz or any
of its Affiliates.

            4.19 Certain Payments. Except as otherwise provided for in or
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, no Heinz
Benefit Plan or Spinco Benefit Plan and no other contractual arrangements
between Heinz or Spinco and any third party exist that will, as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements, (a)
result in the payment (or increase of any payment) by Heinz or Spinco or any of
the Spinco Subsidiaries to any current, former or future director, officer,
stockholder, employee or consultant of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries of any
money or other property or rights (other than amounts to be paid by Spinco or
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 9.3), or (b) accelerate or provide
any other rights to benefits to any such individual, whether or not (i) such
payment, increase, acceleration or provision would constitute a "parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) or (ii) the passage of
time or some other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such
payment, acceleration or provision to be triggered.

            4.20 No Other Representations and Warranties. (a) Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article 3 and in this Article 4 and
except for any representations and warranties specifically set forth in the
other Transaction Agreements, Del Monte acknowledges that neither Heinz nor
Spinco nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Spinco or its Subsidiaries, the Spinco Business


                                       33
<PAGE>
or otherwise or with respect to any other information provided to Del Monte,
whether on behalf of Heinz, Spinco or such other Persons, including as to (i)
merchantability or fitness for any particular use or purpose, (ii) the use of
the Spinco Assets and the assets of the Spinco Business and the operation of the
Spinco Business after the Closing in any manner or (iii) the success or
profitability of the ownership, use or operation of the Spinco Business after
the Closing. Neither Heinz, Spinco nor any other Person will have or be subject
to any liability or indemnification obligation to Del Monte or any other Person
to the extent resulting from the distribution to Del Monte, or Del Monte's use
of, any information related to the Spinco Business and any other information,
document or material made available to Del Monte in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations or any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

            (b) In connection with Del Monte's investigation of the Spinco
Business, Del Monte may have received or may receive from or on behalf of Heinz,
Spinco or any of their respective Subsidiaries certain projections or
forward-looking statements, including projected statements of operating revenues
and income from operations. Del Monte acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, that Del Monte is familiar with such uncertainties, that Del Monte is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections and forecasts), and that Del Monte, in the absence of
fraud, shall have no claim against Heinz, Spinco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any other Person acting on their behalf with respect thereto.
Accordingly, neither Heinz, Spinco nor their respective Subsidiaries make any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forward-looking statements and other forecasts and plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans).

statements, proxy statements or information statements required to be filed by

March 31, 2002, the business of Del Monte has been conducted in all material
respects only in the ordinary course, and there has not been any event

other than as would be permitted by Section 6.2(j), any change by Del Monte or
its Subsidiaries in its accounting principles, practices or methods or (v) any
increase in the compensation payable by Del Monte or any of its Subsidiaries to

policy or arrangement for the benefit of any current or former directors,

obtain the necessary vote in favor of the adoption of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and approval of the Share Issuance. The Board of
Directors of Del Monte shall not withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Heinz the Del Monte Board Recommendation (or announce publicly its
intention to do so), except to the extent permitted by Section 6.4(c).

Proposal, (iii) waive, amend or modify any standstill or confidentiality

prior to obtaining the Share Issuance Approval, engaging in any discussions or
negotiations with, or providing any non-public information to, any Person in
response to an unsolicited written bona fide Del Monte Acquisition Proposal by
any such Person, if and only to the extent that (i) prior to furnishing
information to, or requesting information from, a third party which has made a
written bona fide Del Monte Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of Del
Monte concludes that such Del Monte Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be
expected to constitute a Superior Proposal, provided that such third party has
executed an agreement with standard confidentiality provisions substantially
similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) Del Monte's
Board of Directors, after consultation with independent counsel, determines in
good faith that furnishing such information, or engaging in such discussions or
negotiations, is necessary for Del Monte's Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary duties to Del Monte's stockholders under applicable law, and (iii) Del
Monte has complied with its obligations in this Section 6.4(a), including those
set forth in the next sentence. Del Monte shall notify Heinz and Spinco promptly
(and in any event by 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the next day) after Del Monte
shall become aware of the receipt of any such inquiries, proposals or offers
received by, any such information requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, Del Monte, any Subsidiary
of Del Monte or any of their officers, directors, employees, advisors or agents
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person, the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and, from time to time,
whether Del Monte is providing or intends to provide the Person making the Del
Monte Acquisition Proposal with access to information concerning Del Monte and
thereafter keeps Heinz fully informed of the status and terms of such
discussions or negotiations and of any modifications to such inquiries,
proposals or offers. Del Monte represents that it is not in violation of its
obligations under the letter agreement dated as of May 3, 2002, among Heinz, Del
Monte and Stockholder (the "Letter Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Del Monte's Board of Directors shall receive a bona fide, unsolicited Del
Monte Acquisition Proposal as to which financing is not committed and if Del
Monte's Board of Directors shall determine in good faith that such Del Monte
Acquisition Proposal would, but for the question of the financial capability of
the proposed acquiror, constitute a Superior Proposal, then in such event Del
Monte's Board of Directors and its financial advisor may, for the purpose of
determining whether such proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, conduct such
limited inquiries of the proponent of such Del Monte Acquisition Proposal as are
necessary for the sole purpose of ascertaining whether the proposed transaction
is reasonably capable of being consummated by such proponent so as to constitute
a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that Del Monte shall not conduct any
further inquiries, discussions or negotiations, or provide any non-public
information to such proponent, unless Del Monte's Board of Directors reaches the


                                       56
<PAGE>
conclusion that such Del Monte Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected
to constitute a Superior Proposal, taking into account the financial capability
of the proponent thereof.

           (b) From the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the Termination Date, each of Heinz and Spinco agrees that
neither it nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall, and each of Heinz and
Spinco shall cause its respective directors, officers, partners, employees,
advisors, controlled Affiliates, representatives, agents and other
intermediaries (including any investment banker, accountant, legal advisor or
other consultant) not to (i) directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
encourage any inquiry or proposal regarding a Spinco Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
provide any non-public information or data to any Person relating to a Spinco
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) waive, amend or modify any standstill or
confidentiality agreement (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) to which it
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating primarily to the Spinco Business,
(iv) engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning a Spinco Acquisition
Proposal, or (v) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement a Spinco Acquisition Proposal or agree to, recommend or accept a
Spinco Acquisition Proposal and request the return of any confidential
information distributed to any such parties in connection with any such
activities, discussions or negotiations. Heinz represents that it is not in
violation of its obligations under the Letter Agreement.

           (c) Prior to receipt of the Share Issuance Approval, if (i) Del Monte
has complied with Section 6.4(a) and (ii) the Board of Directors of Del Monte
(A) reasonably determines in good faith that a Del Monte Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal (and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
after taking into account any modifications proposed by Heinz and Spinco during
any five business day period referred to below) and (B), after consultation with
independent counsel, has concluded, in good faith, that it is required to do so
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Del Monte Stockholders under
applicable law, then, on the fifth business day following Heinz's and Spinco's
receipt of written notice from Del Monte or Del Monte's Board of Directors of
their intention to do so, the Board of Directors of Del Monte may withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Heinz or
Spinco, the Del Monte Board Recommendation (a "Change in the Del Monte Board
Recommendation"); provided, that during such five business day period, Del Monte
shall be obligated to negotiate in good faith with Heinz and Spinco any
modifications to this Agreement proposed by Heinz and Spinco to result in an
equivalent proposal.

           (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Del
Monte or its Board of Directors shall be permitted, to the extent applicable, to
comply with Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard
to a Del Monte Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that neither Del Monte
nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as permitted
by Section 6.4(c), withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify, the Del Monte Board Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, a Del Monte Acquisition Proposal.

           6.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte will each
use its reasonable best efforts to cause all of the conditions, as specified in
Article 8 of this Agreement, to the obligations of the others to consummate the
Merger to be met as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.


                                       57

           6.6 Cooperation of Third Parties. Where the cooperation of third
parties such as insurers or trustees would be necessary in order for a party
hereto to completely fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements, each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to seek the cooperation of such third parties.

           6.7 Consummation of the Distribution. Heinz will use its reasonable
best efforts to consummate the Distribution on the Closing Date, subject to
satisfaction of the conditions thereto set forth in the Separation Agreement.

           6.8 Interim Financial Information. Each of Heinz and Spinco on the
one hand, and Del Monte, on the other hand shall, prior to the Closing, provide
each other within a reasonable period after such Party closes its books for the
applicable accounting period for the Spinco Business (with respect to Heinz and
Spinco) and for Del Monte's business (with respect to Del Monte) with (a)
unaudited profit and loss statements for each quarterly period, together with a
balance sheet as of the end of such period, and (b) monthly management profit
and loss statements. Such quarterly financial information shall be in the same
format and prepared on the same basis as the comparable portions of the Audited
Statements (with respect to Heinz and Spinco) and the Del Monte SEC Documents
(with respect to Del Monte), and shall be in accordance with GAAP, except that
such information may exclude footnotes and is subject to normal year-end
adjustments.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

           7.1 WARN. Neither Heinz (with respect to the Spinco Business only),
Spinco nor Del Monte shall, at any time within the 90-day period prior to the
Effective Time, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in WARN or any state or local law, affecting in whole or in part any
site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee of Spinco or Del Monte,
without notifying the other in advance and without complying with the notice
requirements and all other provisions of WARN and any state or local law.

           7.2 Cooperation. Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte and Merger Sub shall
together or pursuant to the allocation of responsibility set forth below or
otherwise to be agreed upon between them take, or cause to be taken, the
following actions:

           (a) Transition. From and after the execution of this Agreement,
Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate in the transition and integration process
in connection with the Merger;

           (b) NYSE and Other Listings. As promptly as practicable, Del Monte
shall file a supplemental listing application with the NYSE and the PE and any
other stock exchanges for the listing or quotation of the shares of Del Monte
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be
Approved for Listing;


                                       58
<PAGE>
           (c) Blue Sky Filings. Del Monte shall take all such action as may
reasonably be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection
with the issuance of shares of Del Monte Common Stock pursuant to the Merger;

           (d) Required Consents. Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with one another in determining whether any filings are required to be
made with or consents required to be obtained from, any Governmental Authority
or any lender, lessor or other third party prior to the Effective Time in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

           (e) Further Assistance. Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte and Merger Sub shall
provide such further assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and with carrying out the purpose of the
Agreement. Each of Spinco, Heinz and Del Monte shall furnish to the other's
counsel all such information as may reasonably be required to effect the
foregoing actions; and

           (f) Financing Cooperation. The Parties agree to provide, and each
Party will cause its respective Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries'
respective officers, employees and advisers to provide, all cooperation
reasonably necessary in connection with the arrangement of the financing
described in the Commitment Letters (including any capital markets financing
contemplated by the Engagement Letter) in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Separation Agreement and any other
financing, all to be consummated contemporaneously with or at or after the
Effective Time in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Separation Agreement, including participation in meetings, due diligence
sessions, road shows, the preparation of offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents, the execution and delivery of any
commitment letters, credit agreements, underwriting or placement agreements,
pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
requested certificates or documents, including comfort letters of accountants
and legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by any other Party, and taking
such other actions as are reasonably required to be taken by the Parties and
each Party's respective Subsidiaries in the Commitment Letters; provided,
however, that neither Party shall have any obligation at any time to continue to
attempt to arrange or otherwise pursue the capital markets financing
contemplated by the Engagement Letter if at such time such capital markets
financing is not available on commercially reasonable terms in accordance with
Section 7.2(f) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter; provided, further, that neither
Party shall have any obligation to attempt to arrange or otherwise pursue any
capital markets financing contemplated by the Engagement Letter in an original
principal amount in excess of $300,000,000. Notwithstanding the timing reflected
in the preceding sentence, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to investigate the feasibility of accelerating the borrowing of the
capital markets financing contemplated by the Engagement Letter so that the
condition to Heinz's and Spinco's obligation to consummate the Merger set forth
in Section 8.2(h)(ii) shall be satisfied as promptly as practicable. The Parties
will keep one another informed of the status of their efforts to arrange the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters, including making reports with
respect to significant developments. In the event any portion of such financing
becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources originally contemplated at
the times contemplated in the first sentence of this Section 7.2(f), Section
7.2(f) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter and this sentence, the Parties will use
their reasonable best efforts


                                       59
<PAGE>
to arrange replacement financing, if necessary, on terms and conditions that
would cause the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(h), 8.2(h) and 8.3(e) to be
satisfied, it being understood that (i) the Parties shall have a reasonable and
customary time to endeavor to arrange the capital markets financing described in
the Engagement Letter following receipt of the Section 355 Ruling (or waiver by
Heinz of the condition set forth in Section 8.2(f)) and that (ii) in the event
that such capital markets financing is not available on commercially reasonable
terms in accordance with Section 7.2(f) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter, the
issuance of the senior secured notes contemplated by the Second Commitment
Letter on terms and conditions not materially more burdensome to Heinz, Spinco,
Del Monte or the Surviving Corporation than those set forth in the Second
Commitment Letter shall be deemed to satisfy the condition set forth in Section
8.2(h)(ii).

           7.3 Proxy Statement/Prospectus. If, at any time after the mailing of
the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus and prior to the Del Monte
Stockholders Meeting, any event should occur that results in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement containing an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitting to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or that otherwise
should be described in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, Spinco, Heinz and Del Monte
shall promptly notify each other of the occurrence of such event and then
promptly prepare, file and clear with the SEC such amendment or supplement and
Del Monte shall, as may be required by the SEC, mail to the Del Monte
Stockholders and Heinz's shareholders each such amendment or supplement.

           7.4 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment; Section 355 Ruling. (a)
Neither Del Monte nor Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action,
whether before or after the Effective Time, that (i) would disqualify the
transactions contemplated hereby from constituting a tax-free distribution under
Sections 355 and 368 of the Code, (ii) would result in any failure to obtain the
Section 355 Ruling or (iii) would disqualify the Merger from constituting a
tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.

           (b) Del Monte and Merger Sub shall cooperate with Heinz and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to assist Heinz in obtaining the
Section 355 Ruling.

           (c) Neither Heinz nor Spinco shall take or cause to be taken any
action, whether before or after the Effective Time, that (i) would disqualify
the transactions contemplated hereby from constituting a tax-free distribution
under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code, (ii) would result in any failure to
obtain the Section 355 Ruling or (iii) would disqualify the Merger from
constituting a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.

           7.5 2002 Audited Financial Statements. Each of Heinz and Spinco shall
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Del Monte
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (i) an audited combined
statement of assets and liabilities of the Spinco Business and the notes thereto
as of May 1, 2002 (the "Audited 2002 Balance Sheet") and the audited combined
statement of operations and the notes thereto for the year ended May 1, 2002
(the "Audited 2002 Statement of Operations" and, together with the Audited 2002
Balance Sheet, the "2002 Audited Financial Statements"), audited by Heinz's
independent


                                       60
<PAGE>
auditors, whose report thereon will be included therewith and (ii) all other
financial statements and financial information regarding Spinco and the Spinco
Business required by the SEC to be included in the Form S-4.

           7.6 Employee Matters and Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Maintenance of
Compensation and Benefits. In general, on and after the Effective Time, Del
Monte shall treat all Spinco Employees fairly and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) for the two year period following the Effective Time,
provide a cash compensation structure (base salary and bonus opportunities)
which is no less than that provided to the Spinco Employees prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) for the one year period following the Effective Time (the
"One-Year Period") maintain benefits (other than specific benefits described
herein which are subject to different maintenance periods) that are the same as
those provided to the Spinco Employees prior to the Effective Time (subject to
Section 3.4(b) of the Employee Benefits Agreement) and (iii) for the second year
following the Effective Time, maintain benefits that are, in the aggregate, not
materially less favorable than what the Spinco Employees were provided prior to
the Effective Time (subject to Section 3.4(b) of the Employee Benefits
Agreement); provided, however, that, with respect to those employees whose terms
and conditions of employment are governed by collective bargaining agreements or
by provisions of law outside the United States of America for employees employed
in such foreign jurisdiction, Del Monte shall, or shall cause Spinco to, assume
and comply with the terms of such collective bargaining agreements and comply
with the provisions of such foreign laws with respect to the subject matter
relating hereto, to the extent such agreements and/or laws require terms and
conditions other than those provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Heinz shall administer (or cause to be administered) the employee benefit plans
and programs provided to the Spinco Employees after the Effective Time, except
as otherwise provided in the Employee Benefits Agreement, and shall provide (or
cause to be provided) transition services to Del Monte pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement, for the One-Year Period (or, if requested by Del
Monte, for up to two years following the Effective Time); provided, however,
that Heinz shall only provide (or cause to be provided) such transition services
so long as the benefit plans and programs that Heinz shall be administering (or
causing to be administered) shall contain the same terms and conditions as in
effect for such plans and programs prior to the Effective Time (subject to
Section 3.4(b) of the Employee Benefits Agreement).

           (b) Continuation of Certain Spinco Benefit Plans. In furtherance of
the obligations under subparagraph (a) above:

               (i) Del Monte shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
      provide cash payments and benefits to any Spinco Employee who is
      terminated without "cause" prior to the second anniversary of the
      Effective Time (in accordance with the severance plans listed in Section
      4.12(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter, as modified by the terms set
      forth on Annex I to Section 4.12(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter (the
      "Severance Plans")). For this purpose, "cause" shall have the meaning set
      forth in the Severance Plans applicable to the Spinco Employee if the
      termination of employment had occurred prior to the Effective Time.

               (ii) At the Effective Time, Heinz shall pay to each Spinco
      Employee an amount, in cash, equal to the annual bonus that each such
      employee has earned (based


                                       61
<PAGE>
      on the achievement of previously established performance criteria) under
      the applicable Heinz Bonus Plan in which such employee participates for
      the 2003 bonus year. From the Effective Time through the second
      anniversary of the Effective Time, Del Monte shall, or shall cause the
      Surviving Corporation to, maintain the annual incentive compensation plans
      set forth in Section 4.12(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter (the "Bonus
      Plans") and allow the Spinco Employees to continue to participate in the
      Bonus Plans on the same terms (including the same levels of bonus
      opportunity and reasonable and comparable performance targets, but
      excluding any retention incentives that Heinz may provide to certain
      Spinco Employees under the Bonus Plans in connection with the transactions
      contemplated under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements on
      or prior to the Effective Time) as in effect immediately prior to the
      Effective Time; provided, however, that Del Monte through such period
      shall not, and shall not cause the Surviving Corporation to, terminate the
      Bonus Plans or amend such plans in any manner that would be reasonably
      likely to result in the Spinco Employees having less of an opportunity to
      earn bonuses under the Bonus Plans after the Effective Time than such
      Spinco Employees would have had under the Bonus Plans applicable to such
      Spinco Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

               (iii) At the Effective Time, Spinco shall assume all liabilities
      associated with the notional shares of Heinz Common Stock held by Spinco
      Employees in accordance with the Heinz Deferred Share Units Plan (each
      such notional share, a "Deferred Share Unit") held by Spinco Employees
      immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that each such unit
      shall be converted into notional shares of Del Monte Common Stock, in
      accordance with the following formula: (x) immediately prior to the
      Effective Time, the number of Deferred Share Units shall be multiplied by
      the closing price of one share of Heinz Common Stock on the last business
      day prior to the date the Heinz Common Stock trades ex dividend, and (y)
      such product shall then be divided by the Spinco Post-Distribution Stock
      Price, (z) the result of which shall be multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
      which final product shall equal the number of notional shares of Del Monte
      Common Stock ("Del Monte Deferred Share Units") that the Spinco Employees
      shall hold after the Effective Time. Thereafter, (A) the Del Monte
      Deferred Share Units shall continue to track the performance of the Del
      Monte Common Stock, (B) the Spinco Employees shall vest as to one-third of
      such units on each of the first three consecutive anniversaries of the
      Effective Time, and (C) the Del Monte Deferred Share Units shall be paid
      out in shares of Del Monte Common Stock at such times as the Spinco
      Employees shall vest in such units (or otherwise in accordance with the
      terms of the Heinz Deferred Share Units Plan).

               (iv) On and after the Effective Time, Del Monte shall, or shall
      cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain the post-retirement medical
      benefit programs for the benefit of the Spinco Employees (the "Retiree
      Medical Plans"), subject to the same terms and conditions, and the same
      rights and privileges as were held by Heinz prior to the Effective Time,
      as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which terms and
      conditions include the right to receive medical coverage at retirement,
      provided that the Spinco Employee was hired by Heinz or any of its
      Subsidiaries prior to 1992 and has at least ten years of service with
      Heinz, any of its Subsidiaries and any member of the


                                       62
<PAGE>
      Spinco group, in the aggregate, after age 45), for the Spinco Employees
      who are eligible to participate in such plans immediately prior to the
      Effective Time.

               (v) On and after the Effective Time through at least the One-Year
      Period, Del Monte shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
      maintain the Spinco Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for the benefit
      of Spinco Employees who participated in such plan immediately prior to the
      Effective Time, without adverse amendment thereto, the liabilities
      associated therewith having been assumed by Spinco pursuant to the
      Employee Benefits Agreement, on the same terms and conditions as in effect
      immediately prior to the Effective Time.

               (vi) On and after the Effective Time, Del Monte shall, or shall
      cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain the Spinco Supplemental
      Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"), as in effect immediately prior to
      the Effective Time for the benefit of the Spinco Employees who
      participated in the SERP immediately prior to the Effective Time (each
      such employee, a "SERP Participant"), without adverse amendment thereto,
      for so long as may be required to allow each SERP Participant who remains
      employed with Spinco through age 55 to continue to accrue benefits, and to
      vest in such benefits, under the SERP; provided, however, that Del Monte
      shall cause the SERP to provide that if any SERP Participant who has
      achieved at least age 50 (with at least five (5) years of service with,
      collectively, Heinz, its Subsidiaries and the Spinco Group) on or prior to
      the second anniversary of the Effective Time is terminated without "cause"
      (within the meaning of Section 7.6(b)(i) of this Agreement) by Spinco (or
      any successor thereto), such SERP Participant shall be vested in his or
      her SERP benefit (as accrued through the date of termination of
      employment) on the date of termination.

               (vii) On and after the Effective Time, Del Monte shall, or shall
      cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to allow Spinco Employees who
      have banked vacation pursuant to the vacation policy provided to Spinco
      Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time to use such banked
      vacation in accordance with such vacation policy at least until the second
      anniversary of the Effective Time.

               (viii) On and after the Effective Time, Del Monte shall honor the
      terms of the Spinco Retention Incentive Plan (as set forth in Section
      7.6(b) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter); provided, however, that with
      respect to the payment of the Pool (as defined therein), Heinz shall
      reimburse Del Monte for an amount, equal to the sum of (x) one-third of
      the total amount of the Pool paid out to the participating Spinco
      Employees (up to a maximum of one-third of $5,000,000) plus (y) the amount
      of the Pool that is paid out to the participating Spinco Employees, if
      any, that is in excess of $5,000,000, in accordance with the terms of such
      plan.

               (ix) Subject to Section 7.6(a) of this Agreement, Del Monte shall
      have no obligation to continue any plan comparable to the Heinz Global
      Stock Purchase Plan, Heinz Executive Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan, and
      the Heinz Premier Life Insurance Plan or the Heinz Restricted Stock Bonus
      Plan (other than as provided under Section 7.1(d) of the Employee Benefits
      Agreement).


                                       63
<PAGE>
           (c) Collective Bargaining Agreements. Spinco, as the Surviving
Corporation, shall expressly assume all collective bargaining agreements set
forth in Section 4.13(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Letter, and for each such
collective bargaining agreement in effect as of the Effective Time, Spinco
agrees to recognize the union which is a party to each such collective
bargaining agreement as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for
the Spinco Employees covered under the terms of each such collective bargaining
agreement.

           (d) Continuation of Employment of Spinco Employees. After the
Effective Time, Del Monte shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue (i)
to employ any Spinco Employee who, at the Effective Time, is not actively at
work by reason of any leave of absence (including military leave, Family Medical
Leave Act leave, or otherwise), as listed in Section 7.6(d) of the Spinco
Disclosure Letter, and (ii) to provide any such Spinco Employee with a job
comparable to the job from which such employee was on leave of absence at the
Effective Time, so long as such employee actively returns to work within the
period of time specified under the applicable terms of such employee's leave
(whether pursuant to a Spinco Benefit Plan, a collective bargaining agreement or
applicable law.

           (e) Pre-existing Conditions; Service Credit. On and after the
Effective Time Del Monte shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i)
waive any limitations to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Spinco
Employees under any welfare benefit plan in which such employees may be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent that such limitations did
not apply or had been satisfied by such Spinco Employees and their covered
dependents prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each Spinco Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time for
the plan year in which the Merger occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare benefit plan in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and (iii)
recognize all service of the Spinco Employees rendered as employees of Heinz and
any of its Affiliates for all purposes (including purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit, service credit, entitlement for benefits, and
benefit accrual (including vacation accrual) in any benefit plan (including
service award plans) in which such employees may be eligible to participate
after the Merger), to the same extent taken into account under a comparable
Spinco Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and maintained
pursuant to the terms of the Employee Benefits Agreement after the Effective
Time.

           (f) Defined Benefit Pension Plans. Through at least the One-Year
Period, Del Monte shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
those Spinco Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified defined benefit
pension plans for purposes of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code in
which hourly Spinco Employees participate as of the Effective Time (the "Spinco
Pension Plans") and under which, as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, by operation of law, assume the Pension Liabilities (as
defined in the Employee Benefits Agreement), which liabilities will be
calculated using the assumptions provided in the Employee Benefits Agreement. In
addition, after the Effective Time, Heinz shall cause to be transferred, in
accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA, to the
trustee of the Spinco Pension Plans, assets, with respect to each Spinco Pension
Plan, that are equal to the Pension Liabilities as of the Effective Time (and
the pro rata amount of any excess assets available with respect to each such
Spinco Pension Plan) in accordance with


                                       64
<PAGE>
the terms of the Employee Benefits Agreement, and Del Monte shall cause the
trustee of the Spinco Pension Plans to accept such assets; provided, however,
that Heinz shall only cause such assets to be transferred after receipt from Del
Monte of a copy of the most recent favorable IRS determination letter for each
Spinco Pension Plan received by Del Monte or an opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Heinz, to the effect that
(i) Del Monte has timely filed, or has caused the Surviving Corporation to
timely file, an application with the IRS requesting a favorable determination
that each Spinco Pension Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
that the trust thereunder is exempt under Section 501 of the Code, (ii) counsel
reasonably expects each such Spinco Pension Plan and trust to receive such a
favorable determination letter, and (iii) each such Spinco Pension Plan (and any
trust agreement related thereto) shall be amended, in a timely manner, as may be
required by the IRS in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 401 of the
Code and that the trust thereunder is exempt under Section 501 of the Code.

           (g) Defined Contribution Plans. Through at least the One-Year Period,
Del Monte shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain those
Spinco Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified defined contribution
plans for purposes of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code in which the
Spinco Employees participate as of the Effective Time (the "Spinco Savings
Plans") and under which, as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, by operation of law, assume the liabilities in respect of the applicable
Spinco Employees. In addition, after the Effective Time Heinz shall cause to be
transferred the full account balances (as of the date of transfer) of the Spinco
Employees under the Spinco Savings Plans to the trustee of the Spinco Savings
Plans in accordance with the terms of the Employee Benefits Agreement and Del
Monte shall cause the trustee of the Spinco Savings Plans to accept such assets;
provided, however, that Heinz shall only cause such assets to be transferred
after receipt from Del Monte of a copy of the most recent favorable IRS
determination letter for each Spinco Savings Plan received by Del Monte or an
opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
Heinz, to the effect that (i) Del Monte has timely filed, or has caused the
Surviving Corporation to timely file, an application with the IRS requesting a
favorable determination that each Spinco Savings Plan is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and that the trust thereunder is exempt under Section 501 of
the Code, (ii) counsel reasonably expects each such Spinco Savings Plan and
trust to receive such a favorable determination letter and (iii) each such
Spinco Savings Plan (and any trust agreement related thereto) shall be amended,
in a timely manner, as may be required by the IRS in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 401 of the Code and that the trust thereunder will be
exempt under Section 501 of the Code.

           (h) Del Monte Parachute Payments. At all times on and after the date
of this Agreement, Del Monte shall use its best efforts to cause the
transactions contemplated hereunder not to constitute a "Change of Control", as
defined in any Del Monte Benefit Plan, for the purposes of avoiding, preventing
or prohibiting (i) the payment (or increase of any payment) to any current,
former or future director, officer, stockholder or employee of Del Monte or any
of its Subsidiaries, or of any entity the assets or capital stock of which have
been acquired by Del Monte or a Del Monte Subsidiary, of any money or other
property or rights, or (ii) the acceleration or provision of any other rights or
benefits to any such individual, whether or not (x) such payment, increase,
acceleration or provision would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) or (y) the passage of time or some other


                                       65
<PAGE>
subsequent action or event would be required to cause such payment, increase,
acceleration or provision to be triggered.

           (i) No Duplication of Benefits. It is the understanding of the
parties that Section 7.6 of this Agreement shall be construed and applied
without duplication of benefits to any Spinco Employees, in order to avoid any
such employee simultaneously enjoying coverage or the accrual of benefits under
comparable plans of both Del Monte and/or Spinco, on one hand, and Heinz on the
other hand.

           7.7 Investigation. Upon reasonable notice, each of Heinz (with
respect to the Spinco Business only) and Del Monte shall, throughout the period
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, afford to
each other and to its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other authorized representatives, reasonable access to its officers, employees,
consultants and representatives and, during normal business hours, in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with one another's respective business and
operations, to its and its Subsidiaries' plants, properties, Contracts,
commitments, books, records (including tax returns), papers, plans and drawings
and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to
the requirements of the federal or state securities laws, and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause its respective representatives to
furnish promptly to the other such additional financial and operating data and
other information, including environmental information, as to its and its
Subsidiaries' respective businesses and properties as the other or its duly
authorized representatives, as the case may be, may reasonably request;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not permit either Party to conduct
any invasive or destructive environmental sampling, testing or analysis on the
other Party's property. For the purposes of this Section 7.7, all
communications, including requests for information or access, pursuant to this
Section 7.7, shall only be made by and between a representative of each of
Heinz, on the one hand, and of Del Monte, on the other hand, which
representative (a) shall initially be Mitch Ring (or another person designated
in writing by him) for Heinz and David Meyers (or another person designated in
writing by him) for Del Monte and (b) may be replaced with a substitute
representative by either Party from time to time upon reasonable written notice
to the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Heinz (with respect
to the Spinco Business only), Spinco nor Del Monte nor their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide any information to the extent that any
such Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries is legally obligated to keep
such information confidential or otherwise not to provide such information or to
the extent that such access would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
privilege. Each of Del Monte and Heinz (with respect to the Spinco Business
only) will hold, and will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold, any and
all information received from any of the Parties, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

           7.8 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances, Etc. (a) Heinz,
Spinco, Del Monte and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable, make their
respective filings and any other required or requested submissions under the HSR
Act, promptly respond to any requests for additional information from either the
Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, and cooperate in the
preparation of, and coordinate, such filings, submissions and responses
(including the exchange of drafts between each party's outside counsel) so as to
reduce the length of any review periods and (b) subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement,


                                       66
<PAGE>
each of Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, including providing information and using their
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary exemptions, rulings, consents,
authorizations, approvals and waivers to effect all necessary registrations and
filings and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, as promptly as practicable, and to take
all other actions necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
in a manner consistent with applicable law, it being understood that this
Section 7.8(a) does not address the IRS Ruling, which is addressed in Section
7.8(b). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Heinz, Spinco and Del
Monte agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate
and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government
clearances required to consummate the Merger (including through compliance with
the HSR Act and any applicable foreign government reporting requirements), to
respond to any government requests for information, and to contest and resist
any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action. The
Parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to the HSR Act or any other federal, state or foreign
antitrust or fair trade law, and will provide one another with copies of all
material communications from and filings with, any Governmental Authorities in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 7.8, neither Heinz nor Spinco or their
respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, nor Del Monte and its Subsidiaries on
the other hand, shall be required to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Heinz or Spinco, on the one hand,
or Del Monte, on the other hand.

           (b) In connection with the Distribution, Heinz and Spinco shall use
their reasonable best efforts to seek, as promptly as practicable, a private
letter ruling from the IRS, to the effect that the Contribution and the
Distribution (each to be consummated in accordance with the Separation
Agreement, this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements as in effect, or
in the forms attached hereto, as of the date hereof) will qualify as tax-free
transactions under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code and that no gain or loss
will be recognized by Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte or Heinz Shareholders (the
"Section 355 Ruling"); provided, however, that, in the event that the IRS will
not issue one or more of the rulings requested by Heinz, then Heinz, Spinco and
Del Monte shall use their reasonable best efforts to restructure the
transactions in a manner that will preserve the economics of the transactions to
Heinz and Del Monte and result in the receipt of such rulings, but neither Heinz
nor Del Monte shall be required to take any action pursuant to this Section
7.8(b), including any changes to the structure specified in Heinz's ruling
request submitted to the IRS, that would reasonably be expected to result, in
the aggregate, in any costs or detriments, or reductions of benefits, to Heinz
or Del Monte, as the case may be, of more than $20 million.


                                       67

           7.9 Director and Officer Indemnification; Insurance. Del Monte shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (a) for a period of at least six
years after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers or
employees of Heinz and its Subsidiaries that shall become directors, officers or
employees of Del Monte or its Subsidiaries to the maximum extent allowed under
Delaware law for acts or omissions occurring after the Effective Time and (b)
adopt the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
attached hereto as Exhibits A and D, respectively, which provide for the
elimination of personal liability and indemnification and advancement of
expenses to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law and not to modify
such certificate and bylaws in any way that is not applicable to all similarly
situated directors, officers or employees of Del Monte or the Surviving
Corporation.

           7.10 Rule 145 Affiliates. Heinz shall, at least 30 days prior to the
Effective Time, cause to be delivered to Del Monte a list, reviewed by its
counsel, identifying all Persons who are, at the Effective Time, "affiliates" of
Spinco for purposes of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act
(each, a "Rule 145 Affiliate"). Heinz shall furnish such information and
documents as Del Monte may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing such
list. Heinz shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person
who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in the list furnished pursuant to this
Section 7.10 to execute a written agreement (each, a "Rule 145 Affiliate
Agreement"), substantially in the form of Exhibit E to this Agreement, at least
15 days prior to the Effective Time.

           7.11 Public Announcements. Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte shall consult
with each other and shall mutually agree upon any press release or public
announcement relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public announcement
prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by
applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement.

           7.12 Defense of Litigation. Each of Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte shall
use its reasonable best efforts to defend against all actions, suits or
proceedings in which such party is named as a defendant that challenge or
otherwise seek to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. None of Heinz, Spinco or Del Monte shall settle any such action,
suit or proceeding or fail to perfect on a timely basis any right to appeal any
judgment rendered or Order entered against such Party therein without having
previously consulted with the other Parties. Each of Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its Affiliates,
directors and officers to use all commercially reasonable efforts to defend any
such action, suit or proceeding in which such Affiliate, director or officer is
named as a defendant and which seeks any such relief to comply with this Section
7.12 to the same extent as if such Person was a Party.

           7.13 Notification. Each of the Parties shall endeavor to notify the
other Parties as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware (a) that any
representation or warranty of such Party in this Agreement is untrue or
inaccurate if the effect thereof would be that the condition to


                                       68
<PAGE>
Closing set forth in Section 8.2(a) or 8.3(a), as applicable, would be incapable
of being fulfilled as of the Closing Date and (b) of the occurrence of any event
that would have a Material Adverse Effect on such Party; provided, however, that
(i) delivery of any notification or information pursuant to this Section 7.13
shall be for notification purposes only and shall not expand or limit the rights
or affect the obligations of any Party hereunder or give rise to any other
liability on the part of any Party and (ii) the failure to have complied with
this Section 7.13 shall not constitute a breach or have any implications on any
Party's rights or obligations hereunder or give rise to any liability on the
part of any Party.

           7.14 Accounting Matters. In connection with the information regarding
Spinco and the Spinco Business provided by Heinz and Spinco specifically for
inclusion in the Form S-4, Heinz and Spinco shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause to be delivered to Del Monte two letters from Heinz's and Spinco's
independent public accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the
Form S-4 shall become effective and one dated the Closing Date, each addressed
to Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Del Monte and reasonably customary in scope and substance for comfort letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Form S-4.

           (a) In connection with the information regarding Del Monte and Merger
Sub provided by Del Monte and Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4, Del Monte shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause to be delivered to Heinz two letters from Del Monte's
independent public accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the
Form S-4 shall become effective and one dated the Closing Date, each addressed
to Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Heinz and reasonably customary in scope and substance for comfort letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Form S-4.

           7.15 Non-Disclosure. Del Monte agrees that, for a three (3) year
period after the Closing Date, neither Del Monte nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective employees, officers, directors or agents shall at
any time, either directly or indirectly, access, obtain, use, share,
communicate, transmit or otherwise disclose any Heinz Information, including by
obtaining or accessing any such Heinz Information from any former employee of
Heinz or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not currently employed by Del
Monte), it being understood that no Person shall be found to have violated this
Section 7.15 by reason of Heinz Information which they access or obtain by
virtue of such Heinz Information being in their minds so long as such Person
does not otherwise violate this Section 7.15. Del Monte agrees that any material
breach of this Section 7.15 will irreparably harm the business of Heinz, for
which Heinz shall not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in such event,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Heinz may
obtain all appropriate relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, without
the posting of bond or other security, in addition to whatever other remedies it
may have. "Heinz Information" shall mean all information, ideas, concepts,
techniques, methods, processes, plans, strategies, know-how, materials and
documents in any form or medium (including oral, written, tangible, intangible
or electronic) relating to or concerning the past, current or future business,
activities and operations of Heinz other than the Spinco Business which the
Person in question knew, had reason to know or would reasonably be


                                       69
<PAGE>
expected to know was confidential, proprietary or non-public, including
finances, products, services, sales, marketing, advertising and promotions,
intellectual property (including trade secrets, business methods, inventions and
research and development), personnel, suppliers, vendors and competitors;
provided, that Heinz Information shall not include any of the foregoing that (i)
was in the public domain before the date of this Agreement or subsequently came
into the public domain other than as a result of disclosure by Del Monte or any
of its Subsidiaries in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was lawfully received by
Del Monte or any of its Subsidiaries from a third party free of any obligation
of confidence of or to such third party, (iii) is required to be disclosed in a
judicial or administrative proceeding or by law, provided that Del Monte shall
promptly notify Heinz of any such requirement, disclose no more information than
is so required and cooperate with all attempts by Heinz to obtain a protective
order or, similar treatment, (iv) is independently developed by employees,
consultants or agents of Del Monte or any of its Subsidiaries without reference
to any Heinz Information or (v) Heinz has given its prior written consent as to
its disclosure. Without limiting the foregoing, Del Monte agrees that for a
period of twelve months following the Closing Date, neither Del Monte nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall transfer or re-assign any employees specified in Section
7.15 of the Del Monte Disclosure Letter to any division of, or position at, Del
Monte that would give any of such employees responsibility for a business that
would compete with any of the Retained Businesses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 7.15 shall have any effect on
agreements with third parties, or affect any rights that the Parties may have
under common law.

           7.16 Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Heinz or Spinco, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Del Monte's operations prior to the Effective Time. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Del Monte, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct Heinz's or Spinco's operations prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over their respective operations.

           7.17 Debt Instruments. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Heinz and
each of its Subsidiaries (with respect to obligations of the Spinco Business
only), and Del Monte and each of its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable
best efforts to prevent the occurrence, as a result of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of a change in control or any event
that constitutes a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under any debt instrument of any such entity,
including debt securities registered under the Securities Act, (other than Del
Monte's existing credit facility) including by seeking an amendment or waiver of
any such change in control or default; provided, however, that neither Heinz nor
Del Monte (nor their respective Subsidiaries) shall be required to pay any
amounts in connection therewith without the prior written consent of such Party;
provided, further, that if the transfer of any Spinco Asset to Spinco or the
assumption of any Spinco Liability by Spinco would result, upon the consummation
of the Merger, in the occurrence of any event that would constitute a default
(or any event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a
default) under the Indenture dated as of May 15, 2001 among Del Monte, Merger
Sub and Bankers Trust Company, as trustee, then Heinz and Spinco shall use their
reasonable best efforts prior to the consummation of the Merger to amend the
applicable provisions of such Spinco Asset or Spinco Liability or take such
other commercially reasonable actions that will preserve the economics of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and


                                       70
<PAGE>
the other Transaction Agreements to Heinz, Spinco and Del Monte without causing
any such event, default or event of default.

           7.18 Nonsolicitation of Employees. (a) Heinz agrees that for a period
of two years from and after the Closing Date it shall not, and it shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of Del Monte,
directly or indirectly, solicit to hire or hire (or cause or seek to cause to
leave the employ of Del Monte), or enter into a consulting agreement with (i)
any Spinco Employee or (ii) any employee of Del Monte or any of its Subsidiaries
unless, in the case of clause (i) or (ii) above (other than with respect to any
Spinco Employees who were, prior to the Distribution Date, salaried employees of
Heinz or any Subsidiary), such Person ceased to be an employee of Del Monte or
its Subsidiaries prior to such action by Heinz or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that in the case of such Person's voluntary termination of
employment with Del Monte or any of its Subsidiaries, such Person shall have
ceased to be such an employee at least three months prior to such action by
Heinz or any of its Subsidiaries.

           (b) Del Monte agrees that for a period of two years from and after
the Closing Date it shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
without the prior written consent of Heinz, directly or indirectly, solicit to
hire or hire (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of Heinz), or enter
into a consulting agreement with any employee of Heinz or any of its
Subsidiaries unless such Person ceased to be an employee of Heinz or its
Subsidiaries prior to such action by Del Monte or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that in the case of such Person's voluntary termination of
employment with Heinz or any of its Subsidiaries, such Person shall have ceased
to be such an employee at least three months prior to such action by Del Monte
or any of its Subsidiaries.

           (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in
Sections 7.19(a) and (b) shall not apply to bona fide public advertisements for
employment placed by any Party and not specifically targeted at the employees of
any other Party so long as no employees of such other Party are hired as a
result thereof within the two-year period from and after the Closing Date.

           (d) Following the Effective Time, this Section 7.18 shall supersede
the provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement addressing the non-solicitation
of employees.

           7.19 Trade Accounts Receivable; Trade Accounts Payable. (a) Heinz
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to establish processes and systems
that will permit it to separate its Trade Accounts Receivable and Trade Accounts
Payable to the extent relating to the Spinco Business (the "Spinco Accounts")
from those relating to the businesses of Heinz other than the Spinco Business in
order to permit the transfer of the Spinco Accounts to Spinco on the
Distribution Date. The Parties agree that all Spinco Accounts originating prior
to the date on which such processes and systems shall be fully implemented and
effective to make such separation (the "Separation Date") shall be for the
account of Heinz and neither Spinco nor Del Monte shall have any right thereto
or obligation in respect thereof. All Spinco Accounts originating on or after
the Separation Date shall be transferred to Spinco in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Separation Agreement (such Spinco Accounts, the
"Transferred Accounts").


                                       71
<PAGE>
           (b) (i) In the event that the Separation Date occurs prior to the
Distribution Date, on the second business day prior to the Closing Date, Heinz
shall prepare and deliver to Del Monte a statement containing an estimate
derived by subtracting from (A) the difference between (x) the estimated face
value of the Trade Accounts Receivable as of the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date and (y) the estimated face
value of the Trade Accounts Payable as of such time and date (such number the
"Estimated Net Accounts Balance") (B) the difference between (x) the estimated
face value of the Trade Accounts Receivable to be transferred to Spinco pursuant
to the Separation Agreement and (y) the estimated face value of the Trade
Accounts Payable to be transferred to Spinco pursuant to the Separation
Agreement (such number the "Estimated Net Accounts Transferred") (such
difference, the "Estimated Transferred Accounts Differential"). The Estimated
Transferred Accounts Differential shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the information contained in the 2002 Audited Financial Statements and by
applying the same accounting principles, policies and practices utilized in
preparing the 2002 Audited Financial Statements. Heinz shall pay to Spinco at
the Effective Time, by payment of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Spinco, an amount equal to the Estimated Transferred Accounts
Differential, if a positive number.

           (ii) Promptly, and in any event within 90 days following the Closing
Date, Heinz shall prepare and deliver to Del Monte a statement setting forth the
amount derived by subtracting from (A) the difference between (x) the actual
face value of the Trade Accounts Receivable as of the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date and (y) the actual face
value of the Trade Accounts Payable as of such time and date (such number the
"Closing Net Accounts Balance") (B) the difference between (x) the actual face
value of the Trade Accounts Receivable transferred to Spinco pursuant to the
Separation Agreement and (y) the actual face value of the Trade Accounts Payable
to be transferred to Spinco pursuant to the Separation Agreement (such number
the "Actual Net Accounts Transferred") (such difference, the "Actual Transferred
Accounts Differential"), such statement to be certified by Heinz's independent
public accountants . The Actual Transferred Accounts Differential shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the information included in the 2002 Audited
Financial Statements and by applying the same accounting principles, policies
and practices utilized in preparing the 2002 Audited Financial Statements and
the Estimated Net Accounts Balance.

           (iii) If Del Monte in good faith disagrees with the amount of the
Actual Transferred Accounts Differential delivered pursuant to Section
7.19(b)(ii), Del Monte may, within 30 days after its receipt thereof, deliver a
written notice of disagreement to Heinz. Any such notice of disagreement shall
specifically identify the elements of the Actual Transferred Accounts
Differential that Del Monte believes were miscalculated, identifying all alleged
uncounted or improperly included items, and Del Monte shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Actual Transferred
Accounts Differential. If a notice of disagreement shall be timely delivered
pursuant to this paragraph (b)(iii) hereof, the Parties shall, during the ten
(10) days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items. In the absence of such agreement, the
determination of such Actual Transferred Accounts Differential may be referred
within ten (10) days following the end of such ten-day period by either Heinz or
Del Monte for determination to Ernst & Young LLP (the "Expert") and the Expert
shall be instructed to notify both Heinz and Del Monte of its


                                       72
<PAGE>
determination within twenty (20) days of such referral. In connection therewith,
the Expert shall consider only those items or amounts in the Actual Transferred
Accounts Differential as to which Del Monte has disagreed and those items
related thereto and raised for review by Heinz in response to the items disputed
by Del Monte. In making its determination, the Expert shall act as expert and
not arbitrator and its determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
deemed to have been accepted and approved by Heinz and Del Monte and shall be
deemed to constitute the relevant Final Transferred Accounts Differential (as
defined below) for all purposes of this Agreement. The Expert shall deliver to
Heinz and Del Monte a report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the
Actual Transferred Accounts Differential and the calculations supporting such
adjustments. The fees and costs of the Expert shall be shared equally by Heinz
and the Surviving Corporation. As used herein (i) "Final Transferred Accounts
Differential" shall mean (x) if no notice of disagreement is delivered by Del
Monte within the period provided in this Section 7.19(b)(iii) or if no referral
is made to the Expert within the second ten-day period referred to above, the
Actual Transferred Accounts Differential as shown in Heinz's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 7.19(b)(ii) or (y) if such notice of disagreement
is delivered by Del Monte, either (A) as agreed in writing by Del Monte and
Heinz or (B) as shown in the Expert's calculation delivered pursuant to this
Section 7.19(b)(iii) and (ii) "Determination Date" shall mean the date on which
the Final Transferred Accounts Differential shall be determined.

           (iv) If the amount of the Final Transferred Accounts Differential is
positive and is higher than the corresponding amount set forth in the Estimated
Transferred Accounts Differential, then Heinz shall pay the difference to the
Surviving Corporation, as an adjustment, in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 7.19(b)(v), except that if the Estimated Transferred
Accounts Differential was less than zero, Heinz shall only be required to pay
the amount of the Final Transferred Accounts Differential. If the amount of the
Final Transferred Accounts Differential is lower (or if less than zero, more
negative) than the Estimated Transferred Accounts Differential, then the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the difference to Heinz, as an adjustment, in
the manner and with interest as provided in Section 7.19(b)(v), but in no event
shall such payment be greater than the amount, if any, paid by Heinz pursuant to
Section 7.19(b)(i).

           (v) Payments made pursuant to Section 7.19(b)(iv) shall be made by
wire transfer (to accounts designated by Heinz or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be) of immediately available funds no later than the third business
day following the Determination Date. The amount of any such payments shall bear
interest for the period from and including the Closing Date but excluding the
payment date at the LIBOR rate from time to time in effect. Such interest will
be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days for which interest is due.

           (c) (i) In the event that the Separation Date occurs after the
Distribution Date, (A) Heinz shall add to the services to be provided pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement Trade Accounts Payable and Trade Accounts
Receivable administration until the Separation Date shall occur, and (B) on the
second business day prior to the Closing Date, Heinz shall prepare and deliver
to Del Monte a statement containing the Estimated Net Accounts Balance. The
Estimated Net Accounts Balance shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
information contained in the 2002 Audited Financial Statements and by applying
the same accounting principles, policies and practices utilized in preparing the
2002 Audited Financial


                                       73
<PAGE>
Statements. Heinz shall pay to Spinco at the Effective Time, by payment of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Spinco, an amount equal
to the Estimated Net Accounts Balance, if a positive number.

           (ii) Promptly, and in any event within 90 days following the Closing
Date, Heinz shall prepare and deliver to Del Monte a statement setting forth the
Closing Net Accounts Balance, certified by Heinz's independent public
accountants. The Closing Net Accounts Balance shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the information included in the 2002 Audited Financial
Statements and by applying the same accounting principles, policies and
practices utilized in preparing the 2002 Audited Financial Statements and the
Estimated Net Accounts Balance.

           (iii) If Del Monte in good faith disagrees with the amount of the
Closing Net Accounts Balance delivered pursuant to Section 7.19(b)(ii), Del
Monte may, within 30 days after its receipt thereof, deliver a written notice of
disagreement to Heinz. Any such notice of disagreement shall specifically
identify the elements of the Closing Net Accounts Balance that Del Monte
believes were miscalculated, identifying all alleged uncounted or improperly
included items, and Del Monte shall be deemed to have agreed with all other
items and amounts contained in the Closing Net Accounts Balance. If a notice of
disagreement shall be timely delivered pursuant to this paragraph (c)(iii), the
parties shall, during the ten (10) days following such delivery, use their
reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items. In the absence
of such agreement, the determination of such Closing Net Accounts Balance may be
referred within ten (10) days following the end of such ten-day period by either
Heinz or Del Monte for determination to the Expert and the Expert shall be
instructed to notify both Heinz and Del Monte of its determination within twenty
(20) days of such referral. In connection therewith, the Expert shall consider
only those items or amounts in the Closing Net Accounts Balance as to which Del
Monte has disagreed and those items related thereto raised for review by Heinz
in response to the items disputed by Del Monte. In making its determination, the
Expert shall act as expert and not arbitrator and its determination shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be deemed to have been accepted and approved by
Heinz and Del Monte and shall be deemed to constitute the relevant Final Net
Accounts Balance (as defined below) for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Expert shall deliver to Heinz and Del Monte a report setting forth its
adjustments, if any, to the Closing Net Accounts Balance and the calculations
supporting such adjustments. The fees and costs of the Expert shall be shared
equally by Heinz and the Surviving Corporation. As used herein "Final Net
Accounts Balance" shall mean (x) if no notice of disagreement is delivered by
Del Monte within the period provided in this Section 7.19(c)(iii) or if no
referral is made to the Expert within the second ten-day period referred to
above, the Closing Net Accounts Balance as shown in Heinz's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 7.19(c)(ii) or (y) if such notice of disagreement
is delivered by Del Monte, either (A) as agreed in writing by Del Monte and
Heinz or (B) as shown in the Expert's calculation delivered pursuant to this
Section 7.19(c)(iii).

           (iv) If the amount of the Final Net Accounts Balance is positive and
higher than the corresponding amount set forth in the Estimated Net Accounts
Balance, then Heinz shall pay the difference to the Surviving Corporation, as an
adjustment, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 7.19(c)(v),
except that if the Estimated Net Accounts Balance was less than zero, Heinz
shall be required to pay the amount of the Final Net Accounts Balance. If


                                       74
<PAGE>
the amount of the Final Net Accounts Balance is lower than the Estimated Net
Accounts Balance, then the Surviving Corporation shall pay the difference to
Heinz, as an adjustment, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section
7.19(c)(v), but in no event shall such payment be greater than the amount, if
any, paid by Heinz pursuant to Section 7.19(c)(i).

           (v) Payments made pursuant to Section 7.19(c)(iv) shall be made by
wire transfer (to accounts designated by Heinz or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be) of immediately available funds no later than the third business
day following the date on which the Final Net Accounts Balance shall be
determined. The amount of any such payments shall bear interest for the period
from and including the Closing Date but excluding the payment date at the LIBOR
rate from time to time in effect. Such interest will be payable at the same time
as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of the
actual number of days for which interest is due.

           (d) The Parties agree to treat any net payments made pursuant to this
Section 7.19 as either a capital contribution or a distribution, as the case may
be, between Heinz and Spinco occurring immediately prior to the Distribution.

           7.20 Spinco By-Laws. At or prior to the Effective Time Spinco shall
cause its by-laws to be amended, as of the Effective Time, so as to read in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D.

           7.21 Del Monte's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Del Monte shall file, in accordance
with Section 103 of the DGCL, a certificate setting forth the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and certifying that such Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in accordance with
the DGCL, which certificate shall become effective not later than the Effective
Time.

           7.22 Board of Directors of Del Monte; Officers. The Board of
Directors of Del Monte shall adopt a resolution prior to the Effective Time
changing the number of directors on the Board of Directors of Del Monte as of
the Effective Time to nine and changing the composition of the Board of
Directors of Del Monte to be comprised of six persons which shall have been
prior thereto designated by Heinz and three persons which shall have been prior
thereto designated by Del Monte (which three shall include the current CEO of
Del Monte), in each case, subject to the approval of the other, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that (a) a majority of
Heinz's director designees will not be present or former directors or executive
officers of Heinz and (b) none of Heinz's director designees will be directors
or executive officers of Heinz at the time they become directors of Del Monte.
Del Monte shall cause the Board of Directors of Del Monte at the Effective Time
to be apportioned into three classes with (to the extent possible) each class
consisting of two directors designated by Heinz and one director designated by
Del Monte. Del Monte shall obtain the resignation of all those directors who
shall not be continuing as directors, to be effective at the Effective Time (the
"Required Resignations"). Del Monte shall take all requisite action so that, at
the Effective Time, (a) the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of
Del Monte shall be Mr. Wolford, (b) the Chief Operating Officer of Del Monte
shall be Mr. Smith


                                       75
<PAGE>
and (c) the Chief Financial Officer of Del Monte shall be Mr. Meyers, with all
other officers to be as directed by the Board of Directors of Del Monte.

           7.23 Covenant Not To Compete; Restriction on Use of Intellectual
Property. (a) In furtherance of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, Heinz covenants and agrees that, for a period ending on the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Heinz nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, without the prior written consent of Del Monte, engage, directly or
indirectly, in the Restricted Business in the Heinz Restricted Territory (the
"Heinz Restricted Business"); provided, however, that nothing set forth in this
Section 7.23 shall prohibit Heinz or its Affiliates from (i) engaging in the
businesses conducted by Heinz or its Affiliates (excluding Spinco) on the
Closing Date and described in Section 7.23 of the Heinz Disclosure Letter, (ii)
owning not in excess of 5% in the aggregate of any class of capital stock or
other equity interest of any corporation engaged in the Heinz Restricted
Business if such stock is publicly traded and listed on any national or regional
stock exchange or on the Nasdaq Stock Market, (iii) owning an interest acquired
as a creditor in bankruptcy or otherwise than by a voluntary investment
decision, or (iv) acquiring the assets or capital stock or other equity
interests of any other Person engaged in the Heinz Restricted Business;
provided, however, that prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date the
net sales attributable to the Heinz Restricted Business conducted by such other
Person accounts for less than 25% of the net sales of such Person for its most
recently completed fiscal year.

           (b) The Parties acknowledge that Heinz has operated global category
teams and has otherwise facilitated the sharing of information (including
know-how, formulae and other confidential and proprietary information) relating
to the Spinco Business (including tuna, soup, gravy and broth and infant
feeding) between the Spinco Business and the business of Heinz engaged in the
Restricted Business in the Del Monte Restricted Territory (the "Residual Spinco
Business"); that the purpose of such team efforts and exchanges has been to
share such Intellectual Property that is common to the Spinco Business and the
Residual Spinco Business in order to promote and transfer best practices,
efficiencies, recipes, formulations, processing techniques, marketing
initiatives and other advantageous business opportunities; and that in order to
protect the Intellectual Property of the Residual Spinco Business, Del Monte
covenants and agrees that, for a period ending on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, neither Del Monte nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the
prior written consent of Heinz, engage, directly or indirectly, in the
Restricted Business in the Del Monte Restricted Territory (the "Del Monte
Restricted Business") using the Intellectual Property transferred or licensed to
Spinco in accordance with the Separation Agreement or the Trademark License
Agreement (or allow third parties to use any of the foregoing to engage in such
business in such territory).

           (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.23(a) and
(b), neither Heinz nor Del Monte nor their respective Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be engaged in activities prohibited by this Section 7.23 with respect
to sales of products to trade customers having outlets in both the Heinz
Restricted Territory and the Del Monte Restricted Territory if, despite having
been advised by either Heinz or Del Monte as to the existence of this Section
7.23, any such trade customer does not restrict the flow of products between the
Heinz Restricted Territory and the Del Monte Restricted Territory.


                                       76

           (d) The Parties agree that the covenants included in this Section
7.23 are, taken as a whole, reasonable in their geographic and temporal coverage
and no Party shall raise any issue of geographic or temporal reasonableness in
any proceeding to enforce such covenant; provided, however, that if the
provisions of this Section 7.23 should ever be deemed to exceed the time or
geographic limitations or any other limitations permitted by applicable law in
any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed reformed in such
jurisdiction to the minimum extent required by applicable law to cure such
problem. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach by
either Heinz or Del Monte, as the case may be, of the provisions of this Section
7.23, monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently,
in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party may, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law or
equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or preliminary and
final injunctive relief or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violation of the provisions hereof, without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting a bond. Each of Heinz and Del Monte further specifically
acknowledges and agrees that the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to an
equitable accounting from the breaching Party of all earnings, profits and other
benefits arising from any such breach.

           7.24 Post Closing Cooperation. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each of the Parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all documents and to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions that may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for Heinz and Del Monte, to
effectuate the provisions of this Agreement.

           7.25 Sole Stockholder Approvals. No later than 14 days after the
execution of this Agreement, (i) Del Monte shall deliver to Merger Sub a written
consent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, in compliance with Section 615
of the NYBCL, adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger, and (ii) Heinz,
as sole stockholder of Spinco, will vote to adopt this Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL.

           7.26 Amendments to Transaction Documents. Del Monte shall have the
right to request in good faith that Heinz and Spinco incorporate into any
Transaction Agreement (other than this Agreement), and Heinz and Spinco shall so
incorporate, such additions, deletions and other modifications thereto that are
consented to by Heinz, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld, unless such consent is sought with respect to an amendment that would,
individually or together with all other such amendments to the applicable
document previously proposed by Del Monte and agreed to by Heinz, reasonably be
expected to result in any material cost or detriment to Heinz (or, prior to the
Merger, Spinco) or result in any material reduction of the benefits to be
obtained by Heinz (or, prior to the Merger, Spinco) from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, in which
case such consent shall be in Heinz's discretion.

           7.27 Post-Closing Delivery of Closing Balance Sheet. Heinz shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Del Monte as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date an audited combined statement of assets and liabilities
contributed as of the Closing Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP (the
"Audited Closing Statement") and audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which
will present the Spinco Assets and the Spinco Liabilities. The Audited Closing
Statement shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Heinz.

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVERS

           9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time whether before or after the Requisite Approval or the adoption
hereof by the stockholders of Spinco and Merger Sub:

           (a) by the mutual written consent of each Party hereto, which consent
shall be effected by action of the Board of Directors of each such Party;

           (b) by either Heinz or Del Monte:

               (i) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before
      March 12, 2003 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right
      to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b)(i) shall not be
      available to any Party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
      under this Agreement at or prior to such date has been a cause of or
      resulted in the failure of the Merger to have become effective on or
      before the Termination Date;

               (ii) if, at the Del Monte Stockholders Meeting duly convened
      therefor (including any adjournment, continuation or postponement
      thereof), the Share Issuance Approval shall not have been obtained; or

               (iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or any other
      Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order (and such Order shall
      have become final and nonappealable), restraining, enjoining or otherwise
      prohibiting the Merger, provided, that, (A) if the party seeking to
      terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b)(iii) is a party to
      the applicable proceeding, such party shall have used its reasonable best
      efforts to remove such Order, and (B) the right to terminate this
      Agreement under this clause (b)(iii) shall not be available to any party
      whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement shall
      have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, such Order;

Monte Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or (ii) shall have
effected a Change in the Del Monte Board Recommendation (or resolved to take any
such action), whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, or (iii) breached
its obligations under Section 6.3 of this Agreement and such breach either by
its terms cannot be cured by the Termination Date or, with respect to any such
breach that is reasonably capable of being remedied, the breach is not remedied
within 30 days after Heinz has furnished Del Monte with written notice of such
breach; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to clause (c)(iii) shall not be available to Heinz to the extent Heinz has
failed in any material respect to fulfill its obligation under Section 6.3(a) to
provide information for inclusion in the Form S-4 and/or to assist in the
preparation of the Form S-4, and such failure was the primary cause of Del
Monte's breach.

           (d) by Del Monte, if Del Monte is not in material breach of the terms
of this Agreement, and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Heinz or Spinco
which breach would cause the condition to closing set forth in Section 8.3(a)
not to be satisfied, and (i) such breach by its nature is not capable of being
cured or (ii) Heinz has not, within thirty days after receipt by Heinz of
written notice of such breach from Del Monte, cured such breach or made any good
faith attempt to cure such breach; and

           (e) by Heinz, if Heinz is not in material breach of the terms of this
Agreement, and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Del Monte or Merger Sub
which breach would cause the condition to closing set forth in Section 8.2(a)
not to be satisfied, and (i) such breach by its nature is not capable of being
cured or (ii) Del Monte has not, within thirty days after receipt by Del Monte
of written notice of such breach from Heinz, cured such breach or made any good
faith attempt to cure such breach.

           The Party hereto desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1 (other than pursuant to Section 9.1(a)) shall give written
notice of such termination to the other Parties in accordance with Section 10.2,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

           9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and of no effect without any liability or obligation on the part of any Party
hereto (or any stockholder, director or officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to the other Parties hereto, except that (a) the
agreements contained in this Section 9.2, Section 9.3, the Confidentiality
Agreement (subject to the terms thereof), the last sentence of Section 7.7 and
in Article 10 shall survive the termination hereof and (b) no such termination
shall relieve any Party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from fraud
or from any willful and material breach by such Party of any covenant or other
agreement included in this Agreement.

           9.3 Fees and Expenses. (a) (i) In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by Heinz pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) then promptly, but in no
event later than two business days after such termination, Merger Sub shall pay
(and Del Monte shall cause Merger Sub to pay) Heinz a fee (the "Termination
Fee") equal to $20,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds.

           (ii) In the event that, following the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time, (A) a Del Monte Acquisition Proposal is commenced,
publicly disclosed, publicly proposed or otherwise communicated to Del Monte or
the Del Monte Stockholders and (B) this Agreement is terminated by either Heinz
or Del Monte pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) or by Heinz pursuant to Section
9.1(c)(i) or (ii) or 9.1(e) and, (C) (I) within 15 months after the date of such
termination, Del Monte enters into a Del Monte Acquisition Agreement relating
to, or consummates, such Del Monte Acquisition Proposal (changing the number in
clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the definition of such term from 5% or 10%, as
the case may be, to 15%) or any other Del Monte Acquisition Proposal (modified
as aforesaid) with the Person making such first Del Monte Acquisition Proposal,
or (II) within 9 months after the date of such termination, Del


                                       82
<PAGE>
Monte enters into a Del Monte Acquisition Agreement relating to, or consummates,
any Del Monte Acquisition Proposal (modified as aforesaid) then Del Monte shall
promptly, but in no event later than two business days after the date such Del
Monte Acquisition Agreement is entered into or such Del Monte Acquisition
Proposal is consummated, as the case may be, pay Heinz the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same day funds.

           Del Monte acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
9.3(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Heinz would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Del Monte fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 9.3(a), and in order to obtain such payment, Heinz commences a suit
which results in a judgment against Del Monte for the fee set forth in this
Section 9.3(a), Del Monte shall pay to Heinz its out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and out-of-pocket expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made plus 300 basis points.

           (b) (i) The Del Monte Financing Fees, and such Heinz Financing Fees
as shall be agreed by Heinz and Del Monte, shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation at or after the Effective Time.

           (ii) The Del Monte Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time.

           (c) On the third business day prior to the Effective Time, Del Monte
shall deliver to Heinz a certificate of its Chief Financial Officer (the "Del
Monte Professional Fee Statement") setting forth all of the Del Monte
Professional Fees paid and to be paid. In the event and to the extent that the
Del Monte Professional Fees exceed $26,500,000 in the aggregate (any such
excess, the "Excess Liability Amount"), as set forth on the Del Monte
Professional Fee Statement immediately prior to the Effective Time, then, at
Heinz's option, either (i) immediately following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay directly or reimburse Heinz for all or a portion
of Heinz's reasonably documented Professional Fees in a dollar amount equal to
three times the Excess Liability Amount or (ii) immediately prior to the
Distribution, the amount of indebtedness to be incurred by Spinco (the proceeds
of which shall be subsequently distributed to Heinz) pursuant to Section 2.09 of
the Separation Agreement shall be increased by a dollar amount equal to three
times the Excess Liability Amount, provided that Heinz may elect a combination
of the alternatives set forth in clauses (i) and (ii). Each of Del Monte and the
Surviving Corporation on the one hand, and Heinz on the other hand, shall advise
one another from time to time in the event that any of them shall become aware
of any Del Monte Professional Fees or any retention payments or other employment
continuation amounts to be paid to Del Monte employees, including severance,
stay bonuses and special incentive compensation, other than payments made in
connection with the matters set forth on Section 1.1 of the Del Monte Disclosure
Letter, which shall not have been set forth on the Del Monte Professional Fee
Statement, and Del Monte shall make a cash payment to Heinz in an amount equal
to three times the amount of any such Del Monte Professional Fees.

           (d) Del Monte and the Surviving Corporation shall not be responsible
for the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of Heinz's investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and


                                       83
<PAGE>
consultants ("Professional Fees"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and
irrespective of whether Heinz shall be entitled to make an election as set forth
in Section 9.3(c), Heinz may, at its election, require Del Monte and the
Surviving Corporation to pay such reasonably documented Professional Fees or to
reimburse it for all or a portion of Heinz's reasonably documented Professional
Fees, in which case the amount of indebtedness to be incurred by Spinco in
accordance with Section 2.09 of the Separation Agreement (or, in lieu thereof,
the amount of cash to be distributed by Spinco to Heinz pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 2.09 of the Separation Agreement) shall be reduced by a
dollar amount equal to the amount of Professional Fees to be paid by Del Monte
and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this sentence.

           (e) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section 9.3, in
the event the Merger is not consummated, all fees and expenses incurred by
Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte or their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, except that all Heinz
Financing Fees and Del Monte Financing Fees, including any obligations incurred
pursuant to the Commitment Letters, shall be shared equally by Heinz and Del
Monte.

           9.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended with the requisite approval of Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte
and Merger Sub, at any time before or after the Requisite Approval or the
adoption hereof by the stockholders of Spinco and Merger Sub; provided, however,
that after such Requisite Approval or adoption, no amendment shall be made that
by law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by Heinz, Spinco, Del Monte and Merger Sub.

           9.5 Waivers. Subject to applicable law, any provision of this
Agreement may be waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such waiver
is in writing and is signed by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

           10.3 Certain Construction Rules. The article and section headings and
the table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, unless otherwise provided to the contrary,
(a) all references to days or months shall be deemed references to calendar days
or months and (b) any reference to a "Section," "Article," "Exhibit" or "Letter"
shall be deemed to refer to a section or article of this Agreement or an exhibit
or schedule to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless otherwise
specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be
exclusive.

           10.4 Letters. Disclosures included in any Section of any Disclosure
Letter shall be considered to be made for purposes of all other Sections of such
Disclosure Letter to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to any
other Section of such Disclosure Letter is reasonably apparent from the text of
such disclosure. Inclusion of any matter or item in any Disclosure Letter does
not imply that such matter or item would, under the provisions of this
Agreement, have to be included in any Disclosure Letter or that such matter or
item is otherwise material.

           10.5 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be
declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall
not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement,
it being the intent and agreement of Spinco, Heinz, Merger Sub and Del Monte
that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the
extent necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its
intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor
another provision that is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same
objective.

           10.6 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by Spinco, Heinz,
Merger Sub or Del Monte (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of all of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the


                                       86
<PAGE>
benefit of and be enforceable by Spinco, Heinz, Merger Sub and Del Monte and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

           10.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
7.10, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person (other than Heinz, Merger Sub, Spinco and Del Monte or
their respective successors or permitted assigns) any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement,
and no Person (other than as so specified) shall be deemed a third party
beneficiary under or by reason of this Agreement.

           10.8 Limited Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or representative
of Spinco, Heinz, Merger Sub or Del Monte, in its capacity as such, shall have
any liability in respect of or relating to the covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties of such party under this Agreement or in respect
of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto and, to the fullest
extent legally permissible, each of Spinco, Heinz, Merger Sub and Del Monte, for
itself and its stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and
agrees not to seek to assert or enforce any such liability that any such Person
otherwise might have pursuant to applicable law.

           10.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the other
Transaction Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and the
Disclosure Letters and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) constitute
the entire agreement of all the parties hereto and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between
the parties, or either of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. All
exhibits and schedules attached to this Agreement and the Disclosure Letters are
expressly made a part of, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement.

           10.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, except that New
York Law and Delaware Law shall apply to the Merger, in each case, without
giving effect to the conflicts of law principles thereof. Each of the Parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees to be subject to, and hereby
consents and submits to, the jurisdiction of the United States District Court
for the Southern District Court of New York located in the borough of Manhattan
in the City of New York, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the jurisdiction of
the courts in the State of Delaware and of the federal courts sitting in the
State of Delaware, as applicable, for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii), to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of
process in the State of New York or the State of Delaware, appoints The
Corporation Trust Company, as such Party's agent in the State of New York or the
State of Delaware, as applicable, for acceptance of legal process and (iii)
agrees that service made on any such agent set forth in (ii) above shall have
the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within
such state.

           10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one agreement binding on Spinco, Heinz and Del Monte,
notwithstanding that not all parties are signatories to the original or the same
counterpart.

           10.12 Specific Performance; Remedies. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any state or
federal court located in New York, New York or the State of Delaware, as
applicable. Except for the foregoing remedies of injunction and specific
performance, the right not to close in the event that the conditions to closing
are not satisfied and the termination rights set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that they shall have no rights or claims against one another for
breaches of this Agreement except in the case of fraud or any willful and
material breach by a party of any covenant or other agreement included in this
Agreement.
