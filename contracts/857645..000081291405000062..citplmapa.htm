Agreement and the other documents, instruments and  agreements to be executed
and delivered by Sellers pursuant hereto or  thereto has been (or, with
respect to the documents, instruments and  agreements to be executed and
delivered after the date hereof, will be at  the Closing) duly authorized by

required action on the part of Sellers and  has been (or, with respect to the
documents, instruments and agreements to  be executed and delivered after the
date hereof, will be at the Closing)  duly executed and delivered by Sellers
and (assuming this Agreement  constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and each of the  other documents, instruments and agreements to be
executed and delivered by  parties pursuant hereto other than Sellers
constitutes a valid and binding  obligation of such other parties) is (or,
with respect to the documents,  instruments and agreements to be executed and
delivered after the date  hereof, will be at the Closing) the valid and
binding obligation of Sellers,  enforceable against Sellers in accordance
with its terms, except as may be  limited by the Bankruptcy Exception.

 

 

 3. _No Conflicts

of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will conflict  with or
result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of  (i) the
organizational documents of any Seller, (ii) any judgment, order, 
injunction, decree, rule, regulation or ruling of any court or of any other 
Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any rule or regulation

is related to the Purchased Assets, the Maintenance Reserves or the Assumed 
Liabilities or (iii) any agreement, contract or commitment to which any 
Seller is a party or to which any Seller or any of its Properties is subject 
and which is related to the Purchased Assets, the Maintenance Reserves or 
the Assumed Liabilities, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, 
for such conflicts or breaches that would not be likely to have a Material 
Adverse Effect; nor will such execution, delivery and compliance result in 
any acceleration in the time for performance of any obligation of Sellers 
under, relating to or affecting any of the Purchased Assets, the Maintenance 
Reserves or Assumed Liabilities or in the creation of any Encumbrance on any 
of the Purchased Assets or the Maintenance Reserves, except in each case as 
would not be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 4. _Consents  

_ 

. No notices, reports or other filings are required to be  made by Sellers
with, nor are any consents, licenses, permits,  Authorizations or approvals
required to be obtained by Sellers from, (i) any  Governmental Entity or (ii)
except where the failure to make such notices,  reports or other filings or
obtain such consents, licenses, permits,  Authorizations or approvals would
not have a Material Adverse Effect, any  other Person in connection with the
execution and delivery by Sellers of  this Agreement or any of the documents,
instruments or agreements to be  executed and delivered by Sellers pursuant
hereto or thereto or the  consummation by Sellers of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.  Without limiting the generality of the

No adjustment relating to such Tax Returns has been proposed  formally or informally by any Governmental Entity, and to Sellers'  Knowledge, no basis exists for any such adjustment. With respect to any  taxable period for which any material Tax Returns have not yet been filed  with respect to any Purchased Asset, or for which material Taxes with  respect to any Purchased Asset are not yet due or owing or are being  contested in good faith, Sellers have made due and sufficient current  accruals for such Taxes on the Books and Records in accordance with GAAP.  

 

 

 2. There are no liens for Taxes upon the Purchased  Assets or the Maintenance Reserves except for liens arising as a matter of  law for Taxes not yet due and payable and liens for Taxes that are being  contested in good faith, in each case, for which adequate reserves have  been provided in the Books and Records in accordance with GAAP. There are  no proposed reassessments of any Purchased Assets or other proposals that  could increase the amount of any Tax in respect of the Purchased Assets.

 3. The LILO Contracts, LILO Sublease Contracts and Owned Car Lease  Contracts have been classified on the federal and state Tax Returns of the  Sellers as leases while such LILO Contracts, LILO Sublease Contracts and  Owned Car Lease Contracts were owned by the Sellers and such  classification has not been challenged by any Governmental Entity in any  correspondence with any Seller.  

 

 

 4. There are no outstanding liabilities for Taxes payable, collectible or  remittable by the Sellers in respect of the Purchased Assets or the  Business, whether assessed or not, which may result in an Encumbrance  (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on, or other claim against, or  seizure or sale of all or any part of, the Purchased Assets or would  otherwise materially adversely affect the Purchased Assets or would result  in Purchaser becoming liable or responsible therefor.  

 

 

 5. No claim in writing has been made by any Governmental Entity within  seven (7) years prior to the date of this Agreement in a jurisdiction  where any Seller does not file Tax Returns that such filings may be  required or that such Seller is or may be subject to taxation by that  jurisdiction in respect of the Purchased Assets.  

 

 

 6. Each of the Sellers has properly and timely withheld, collected and  deposited all amounts for Taxes that were required to be withheld,  collected or deposited in respect of the Purchased Assets.

a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2003, Sellers  have not been the
subject of any Proceeding nor, to Sellers' Knowledge, have  there been any
investigations by or before any Governmental Entity, in  either case relating
to any of the Purchased Assets, the Maintenance  Reserves or Assumed

of the Assigned  Contracts after the Closing Date that adversely affect the
actual gross  profits or revenue realized from the Assigned Contracts; (B)

 5. All  Authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in  _Section 3.4_ hereof (without giving effect to any  qualifications for materiality with regard to Authorizations, consents or  approvals from any Governmental Entity), shall have been obtained and all  Authorizations required for the valid consummation by Sellers and  Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,  without limitation, the expiration or early termination of any applicable  waiting period under the HSR Act (if applicable) and similar legislation  in other jurisdictions, shall have been obtained.

may be abandoned at any time prior to any Closing:

   

 

 1. by  mutual consent of each of Sellers and Purchaser;  

 

 

 2. by  either Sellers or Purchaser, if a Governmental Authority shall have issued  an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently  restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other  action shall have become final and nonappealable;  

 

 

 3. by  either Sellers or Purchaser, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or  before August 31, 2005; __provided__ that the terminating  party is not in breach of this Agreement; or  

 

 

 4. by the Sellers, if Sellers determine, in good faith and after  consulting with their independent financial advisors and legal counsel,  that termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_   and accepting a Superior Proposal is necessary to comply with their  fiduciary duties under applicable law.  

 

 

 2. _Procedure and Effect of  Termination  

_ 

. In the event of termination and abandonment of the  transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to _Section 7.1_ hereof,  written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party to this  Agreement and
this Agreement shall terminate (subject to the provisions of  this _Section

further action by any of the  parties hereto. If this Agreement is terminated
as provided in this  _Section 7.2_ , no party hereto shall have any liability
or further  obligation to any other party to this Agreement resulting from
such  termination except (i) as provided in this _Section 7.2_,  (ii) that
the provisions of _Sections 5.1(b)_, _10.3_ ,  _10.10_ , and _10.12_ hereof
shall remain in full force and effect  and (iii) that such termination shall

available funds no later than one Business day  following the date of such
termination. Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary in this Agreement,
Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that,  with respect to any
termination of this Agreement for which a termination fee  is payable in
accordance with this _Section 7.3_ , the payment and  acceptance of such
termination fee shall constitute liquidated damages with  respect to any
claim for Damages or any other claim that Purchaser would  otherwise be
entitled to assert against Sellers and their Affiliates, and  their
respective directors, managers, members, officers, employees and agents, 
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and 
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to Purchaser 
hereunder or otherwise at law or in equity.

 

 

 8. 
NO COMPETITION; PUBLIC  ANNOUNCEMENTS; NO SOLICITATION 

   

 

 1. _No  Competition  

_ 

. For a period of three (3) years following the Closing  Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), Sellers shall not, within the United  States,
directly or indirectly, in any capacity, render services, engage or  have a
financial interest in, any business that shall be engaged in a  Competitive
Business. If any Governmental Entity determines that the  foregoing
restrictions are too broad or otherwise unreasonable under  applicable law,
including with respect to time or geography, such  Governmental Entity is
hereby requested and authorized by the parties to  revise the foregoing
restriction to include the maximum restrictions  allowable under applicable
law. Each party hereto acknowledges, however,  that this _Article VIII_ has
been negotiated by the parties and  that the time and geographical
limitations, as well as the limitation on  activities, are reasonable in
light of the circumstances pertaining to the  Purchased Assets. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _Competitive  Business_ " shall mean any
business involved in owning or leasing Rail  Cars or providing management or
similar services in connection therewith;  __provided_ , _however__ , that in
no event shall the term  Competitive Business be deemed to include: (i) the
acquisition, directly or  indirectly through Affiliates, of publicly traded
securities issued by any  Person involved in the business of owning or
leasing Rail Cars or providing  management or similar services in connection
therewith if the acquisition is  made for investment purposes only and not to
influence or effect a change in  control of such Person; or (ii) the
acquisition, directly or indirectly  through Affiliates, of Rail Cars if the
acquisition is made for investment  purposes only and not with a view toward
actively managing or leasing the  Rail Cars on behalf of Sellers, their
Affiliates or any third party.

 

 

 2. _Public Announcements 

_  

. Purchaser and Sellers will consult with each other before  issuing any
press release or otherwise making any written public statement  or making any
presentations with respect to the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such 
written public statement or such presentation prior to such consultation and 
the reasonable approval of such press release, public statement or 
presentation by the other party, except as either party may determine is 
required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing 
agreement with any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation
system.

 

 

 

 3. _No Solicitation  

_ 

.

   

 

 1. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date or  the earlier termination of this Agreement, Sellers shall not initiate,  solicit or negotiate or provide any information to facilitate, and Sellers  and their Affiliates shall cause their respective directors, managers,  members, officers, employees, and agents not to initiate, solicit or  negotiate or provide any information to facilitate, any proposal or offer  to acquire all or any substantial part of the Purchased Assets or the  Business, whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or other  transaction, whether for cash, securities or any other consideration or  combination thereof (any such transactions being referred to herein as an  " _Acquisition Transaction_ ").  

 

 

 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 8.3(a)_ hereof,  Sellers may, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ non-binding  written offer or proposal with respect to an Acquisition Transaction (an  " _Acquisition Proposal_ ") from a Person or group of Persons (a  " _Potential Acquirer_ ") that Sellers determine, in good faith and  after consultation with their independent financial advisors  and legal counsel, would likely lead to a Superior Proposal, furnish  confidential or nonpublic information to, and engage in discussions and  negotiate with, such Potential Acquirer. For purposes of this Agreement,  " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Transaction  that Sellers determine, taking into account all legal, financial,  regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, in good faith and after  consultation with their independent financial advisors and legal counsel,  is (i) reasonably likely to be consummated and (ii) would, if consummated,  be more favorable to the respective stockholders, members or partners of  Sellers than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

 

 

 3. Sellers shall notify Purchaser promptly, but in any event no more than  twenty-four hours, after receipt by Sellers (or its advisors) of any  Acquisition Proposal, any request for non-public information in connection  with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the Purchased Assets or  Books and Records by any Potential Acquirer that informs Sellers that it  is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice  shall be made in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the  identity of the Potential Acquirer and the material terms and conditions  of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or contact. Sellers shall continue  to keep Purchaser reasonably informed of all material developments with  respect to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal.  

 

 

 9. 
INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED  MATTERS 

   

 

 1. _Indemnification by  Sellers  

_ 

. Subject to the terms of _Section 9.5(b)_ hereof,  Sellers shall, severally
but not (except as to MILPI as provided in  _Section 9.5(c)_ hereof)
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless  Purchaser and its Affiliates, and their
respective directors, managers,  members, officers, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Purchaser  Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against
and in respect of any and all  Damages suffered or incurred by any of them
resulting from, arising out of,  based on or relating to (i) any breach of
any representation or  warranty made by Sellers in this Agreement; (ii) any
failure to perform duly  and punctually any covenant, agreement or
undertaking on the part of Sellers  contained in this Agreement; or (iii) any
breach of a representation or  warranty included in any certificate, schedule
or other agreement,  instrument or document, in each case delivered by
Sellers to Purchaser  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Sellers  Related Documents_ "). For purposes of this _Section 9.1_ , a
breach  of a representation or warranty contained in _Article III_ hereof
or  any certificate delivered by Sellers hereunder concerning such 
representations and warranties of Sellers shall be deemed to exist if the 
representation or warranty is, or would have been, inaccurate had the 
representation or warranty not contained any limitation or qualification as 
to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or Sellers' Knowledge.

 

 

 2. _Additional Indemnification  by Sellers  

_ 

. Subject to the terms of _Section 9.5(b)_ hereof,  Sellers shall, severally
but not (except as to MILPI as provided in  _Section 9.5(c)_ hereof)
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless all  Purchaser Indemnified Parties from
and against any and all Damages suffered  or incurred by any of them
resulting from, arising out of, based on or  relating to:

   

 

 1. any  of the Excluded Assets or the ownership, operation, servicing, lease or  use thereof, or any action taken with respect thereto, by Sellers or any  other Person; or  

 

 

 2. the  Excluded Liabilities (including, without limitation, any such liabilities  arising by operation of law, statute, common law or otherwise or under  successor liability or similar theories that would impose liability on  Purchaser as a result of its purchase of the Purchased Assets pursuant  hereto).  

 

 

 3. _Indemnification by Purchaser   

_ 

. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and  their Affiliates,
and their respective directors, managers, members,  officers, employees and
agents (collectively, " _Sellers Indemnified  Parties_ ") from and against
any and all Damages suffered or incurred by  any of them resulting from,
arising out of, based on or relating to (i) any  breach of any representation
or warranty made by Purchaser in this  Agreement; (ii) any failure to perform
duly and punctually any covenant,  agreement or undertaking on the part of
Purchaser contained in this  Agreement; or (iii) any breach of a
representation or warranty included in  any certificate, schedule or other
agreement, instrument or document, in  each case delivered or to be delivered
by Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant  to the terms of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Related  Documents_ "). For purposes of this
_Section 9.3_ , a breach of a  representation or warranty contained in
_Article IV_ hereof or any  certificate delivered by Purchaser hereunder
concerning such representations  and warranties of Purchaser shall be deemed
to exist if the representation  or warranty is, or would have been,
inaccurate had the representation or  warranty not contained any limitation
or qualification as to materiality,  knowledge or Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 4. _Additional Indemnification by  Purchaser  

_ 

. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless all Sellers  Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Damages suffered or  incurred by any of
them resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating  to:

   

 

 1. the  Purchased Assets or the ownership, operation, servicing, lease or use  thereof, or any action taken with respect thereto, by Purchaser or any  other person, in each case to the extent occurring or attributable to the  period following the Closing Date; or  

 

 

 2. the Assumed Liabilities.  

 

 

 5. _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Limitations  

_ 

.

   

 

 1. Except as provided in _Sections_ _2.3_ and _2.4_ hereof  and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,  the indemnification provided for in this _Article IX_ shall be the  sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims for Damages resulting  from, arising out of, based on or relating to this Agreement or any of the  transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of any  representation or warranty or any failure to perform any covenant,  agreement or undertaking under this Agreement or any of the certificates,  schedules or other agreements, instruments or documents executed and  delivered in connection herewith.  

 

 

 2. No amount of Damages shall be payable to the Purchaser Indemnified  Parties pursuant to _Section 9.1(i)_ or _Section 9.1(iii)_   hereof unless the aggregate amount of all Damages suffered or incurred by  the Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds $1,000,000.00 (the " _Threshold  Amount_ "); __provided_ , _however__ that if the aggregate  amount of all Damages suffered or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified  Parties exceeds the Threshold Amount, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties  shall be entitled to be indemnified for all Damages to the extent, and  only to the extent, the aggregate amount thereof exceeds $250,000.00. The  maximum aggregate amount of Damages for which indemnity may be recovered  from any individual Seller, other than MILPI, shall be equal to the cash  amount of Purchase Price received by such Seller in connection with the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Further, in no event  shall Sellers be liable for Damages suffered or incurred by Purchaser  Indemnified Parties to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Damages  indemnifiable hereunder exceeds the sum of the Purchase Price.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the limitations in the  first sentence of this _Section 9.5(b)_ shall not apply to (i) any  breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Sellers  contained in _Sections 3.5_ or _3.6_ or the first sentence of  _Section 3.10(a)_ or any certificate delivered by Sellers hereunder  concerning such representations and warranties of Sellers, (ii) any  indemnification by Sellers with respect to Taxes that are included in the  defined term "Excluded Liabilities" or (iii) any liability of Sellers that  may arise pursuant to the proviso in the second sentence of _Section  2.4(b)_ hereof.  

 

 

 3. Notwithstanding _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_ hereof  but subject to the limitations in _Sections 9.5(a)_ and  _9.5(b)_ , in the event that any Purchaser Indemnified Party has a  right to indemnification under this _Article IX_ , MILPI shall be  fully liable, jointly and severally with any other Seller or Sellers who  may be liable for such amount hereunder, for the payment of Damages to  such Purchaser Indemnified Party. Without limitation on the foregoing,  (i) the amount of Damages for which indemnity may be recovered  against MILPI hereunder, if any, shall not be limited except by the  aggregate amount of the Purchase Price paid to all Sellers as provided in  the third sentence of _Section 9.5(b)_ hereof, (ii) MILPI's  indemnity hereunder, if any, shall be independent of the indemnity of any  other Seller, and (iii) MILPI agrees that any indemnity by it  hereunder shall not be affected or limited by, and waives any defense to  its obligations in respect of such indemnity by reason of (A) any  lack of validity or enforceability of the indemnity of any other Seller,  (B) any modification or release of any obligations of any other  Seller, (C) any delay or failure on the part of any Purchaser  Indemnified Party to commence or pursue any remedy against any other  Seller or to take any other action or to join any other Seller in any  action against MILPI, or (D) any other circumstance that might  otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any other  Seller.  

 

 

 6. _Indemnification Procedure  

_ 

. For the purposes of administering the indemnification  provisions of this
_Article IX_ , the following procedures shall apply  from and after the
Closing Date:

   

 

 1. An  indemnified party shall notify the Indemnitor of any Indemnification Event  arising from an action or proceeding by a third party against such  Indemnitor in writing within 15 days following the receipt by any  officer, director, manager or member of the indemnified party of notice of  the commencement of such action or proceeding or within 30 days of  the assertion of any claim against such indemnified party giving rise to  indemnity pursuant to this _Article IX_ (any 15 or 30-day  notification requirement shall begin to run, in the case of a claim which  is amended so as to give rise to an amended Indemnification Event, from  the first day such claim is amended to include any claim which is an  Indemnification Event hereunder). Such notice shall describe in reasonable  detail the basis of such Indemnification Event. Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary, the failure to give notice in a timely fashion shall not  result in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder except to the  extent that the Indemnitor's ability to defend against the event with  respect to which indemnification is sought is adversely affected by the  failure of the indemnified party to give notice in a timely fashion.  

 

 

 2. The  Indemnitor shall be entitled (but not obligated) to assume the defense or  settlement of any such action or proceeding, or to participate in any  negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim, if  it shall provide the indemnified parties a written acknowledgement of its  liability for the indemnity against Damages relating to such claim and, if  any Seller is the Indemnitor, such Seller shall have provided a security  deposit reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party for any such  Damages that may be imposed in connection therewith but in no event shall  such security deposit exceed $1,000,000.00. If the Indemnitor assumes any  such defense or settlement or any such negotiations, it shall pursue such  defense, settlement or negotiations in good faith. If the Indemnitor fails  to elect in writing within 30 days of the notification referred to  above to assume the defense (or, if applicable, fails to provide the  security deposit required as a condition to such assumption), the  indemnified party may engage counsel to defend, settle or otherwise  dispose of such action or proceeding, which counsel shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnitor; __provided_ , _however__ ,  that the indemnified party shall not settle or compromise any such action,  proceeding or claim without the prior written consent or agreement of the  Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  

 

 

 3. In  cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the defense or settlement with  respect to an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to  assume the defense or settlement thereof with counsel of its own choosing;  __provided_ , _however__ , that: (A) the indemnified  party (and its counsel) shall be entitled to continue to participate at  its own cost in any such action or proceeding or in any negotiations or  proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim for which  indemnification is being sought; (B) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled  to settle or compromise any such action, proceeding or claim without the  consent or agreement of the indemnified party (which consent will not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed); __provided_ , _that if and  only if the settlement or compromise provides an unconditional release of  the indemnified party without any ongoing performance by, restriction on,  or adverse admission of, and at no cost or expense to, the indemnified  party, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to enter into such settlement or  compromise without the consent or agreement of the indemnified party; and  (C) after written notice by the Indemnitor to the indemnified party (as  provided above) of its election to assume control of the defense of any  claim (and, if applicable, the provision of the security deposit required  as a condition to such assumption), the Indemnitor shall not be liable to  such indemnified party hereunder for any attorneys' fees and disbursements  subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection therewith  (except as provided below).  

 

 

 4. Any claim for indemnification hereunder that does  not arise out of a third-party claim shall be asserted by the indemnified  party by delivering written notice thereof to the Indemnitor promptly  after the indemnified party becomes aware of the basis for such claim.  Such written notice shall contain (i) a reasonably detailed description of  the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnification,  (ii) the basis for such claim for indemnification pursuant to this  _Article IX_ and (iii) the amount and the type and nature of Damages  suffered or incurred by such indemnified party. If the Indemnitor does not  object to such written notice within 60 days after actual receipt of such  written notice, Indemnitor shall have no further right to contest the  validity of such indemnification claim and shall, following the expiration  of such 60 day period, promptly pay the indemnified party the amount of  Damages to which the indemnified party is entitled pursuant to this  _Article IX_ not to exceed the amount set forth in such written  notice. At Indemnitor's request, the indemnified party shall provide  Indemnitor any information reasonably requested by Indemnitor with respect  to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9.6(d)_   and shall further provide Indemnitor and its counsel with access at all  reasonable times during regular business hours and upon reasonable notice  to personnel and the books and records of such indemnified party for such  purpose.  

 

 

 7. _Survival of Representations and  Warranties  

_ 

. The representations and warranties made by either  Purchaser or Sellers
hereunder shall survive the Closing and the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall remain in  full force and effect until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date;  __provided__ , __however__ that
notwithstanding the  foregoing, the representations and warranties contained
in _Section  3.6_ hereof shall survive until the expiration of all applicable
statutes  of limitation with respect thereto.

 

 

 8. _Tax Treatment  

_ 

. Any payments under this _Article IX_ or under any  other indemnity
provision of this Agreement shall be treated by the parties  hereto for
federal, state and local income tax purposes (whether foreign or  domestic)
as a non-taxable reimbursement or purchase price adjustment, except  to the
extent that a contrary treatment is required by applicable law, in  which
case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify  the
relevant party on an after-Tax basis.

 

 

 10.

 1. _Amendments

. This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded or  canceled and any of

 5. _No Assignment  

_

any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may  be assigned by
Purchaser (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without  the prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld  or
delayed) of each of Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent  shall
be required for Purchaser to assign or delegate, and Purchaser shall  have
the absolute right to assign or delegate, any or all of its rights or

signed version thereof delivered in person. No party  hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a  facsimile machine to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or  agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a  facsimile
machine as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a  contract and

provision of this Agreement.

ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF  ANY LITIGATION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION  WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY EXHIBIT HERETO, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE  OF DEALING OR

any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or  remedies hereunder.
