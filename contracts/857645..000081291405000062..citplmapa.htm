      <LI>If, prior to the Closing Date, any Owned Car suffers a Casualty
      Occurrence of which any Seller has knowledge, such Seller shall promptly,
      but in no event later than one Business Day after such Seller has
      knowledge of the Casualty Occurrence, notify Purchaser in writing of the
      Casualty Occurrence. Unless otherwise requested in writing by Purchaser,
      any Owned Car that suffers a Casualty Occurrence shall be deemed
      eliminated from <U>Schedule 1.8</U> hereto and Purchaser shall have no
      obligation to purchase such Owned Car at the Closing. The Seller holding
      title to any such Owned Car shall retain all rights to receive any
      casualty proceeds or other payments under the terms of any applicable
      Sellers Insurance Policies or from any third party or under any third
      party insurance policy in respect of the Casualty Occurrence
      (collectively, the "<U>Casualty Proceeds</U>"). Notwithstanding the

      receipt (whether before, on or after the Closing Date, and without
      deduction or offset) any Casualty Proceeds (including, without limitation,
      any Casualty Proceeds received from any Obligor or any other third party)

      <LI>If, on or after the Closing Date, either party discovers that an Owned
      Car had suffered a Casualty Occurrence prior to the Closing Date and the
      Owned Car was purchased by the Purchaser at the Closing, neither this
      Agreement nor the Purchase Price shall be adjusted. Instead, Purchaser
      shall be entitled to receive all Casualty Proceeds paid or receivable in
      respect of the Casualty Occurrence and shall have the sole and exclusive
      right to exercise any rights or remedies with respect to such Casualty
      Proceeds; <I><U>provided</I></U>, <I><U>however</I></U> that if the
      aggregate amount of Casualty Proceeds is less than the Assumed Value of
      such Owned Car, and the Obligor under the applicable Owned Car Lease
      Contract (if any) is not otherwise responsible or liable to Purchaser for
      the Casualty Occurrence, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser on demand the
      amount of the difference. The right to receive Casualty Proceeds, and any
      additional amounts from Sellers in accordance with the immediately
      foregoing proviso, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser
      with respect to the events described in this <U>Section 2.4(b)</U> and

      rendered permanently unfit for use (including, without limitation, use in
      unrestricted interchange) from any cause whatsoever, or taken or

      does not give rise to a Casualty Occurrence.

      Car that is subject to an Owned Car Lease Contract is suitable for
      interchange on the lines of Class I railroads. To Sellers&#8217; Knowledge, no
      Owned Car has suffered a Casualty Occurrence or a Partial Casualty

      defense, offset, claim, right of rescission or counterclaim by any party
      thereto, and (ii) is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its
      terms, except as may be limited by the Bankruptcy Exception. No Seller is
      in material breach or material default under any LILO Contract or LILO
      Sublease Contract, no other party is in material breach or material
      default thereunder and no other event has occurred that, with written
      notice or lapse of time, would constitute a material breach or a material
      default by Sellers or, to Sellers&#8217; Knowledge, any other party thereunder.
      Sellers have made available to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies
      of each LILO Contract and LILO Sublease Contract, and all amendments or

      financing lease, conditional sale or security agreement. The Books and
      Records pertaining to each LILO Contract and LILO Sublease Contract are
      accurate and correct in all material respects. Except as set forth on
      <U>Schedule 1.3</U> hereto, the periodic rents under each LILO Sublease
      Contract do not decrease during the current rental term thereof. To
      Sellers&#8217; Knowledge, (A) no payments made on any of such LILO Sublease

      all of the lease agreements or rental agreements pursuant to which any
      Seller acts as the lessor or sublessor of Rail Cars in a

      Reserves is, as of the date set forth on <U>Schedule 1.4</U>, the amount
      set forth on such <U>Schedule 1.4</U>, and such amount is not less than
      the amount required to be maintained as of such date in accordance with

      all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, will pass to Purchaser
      (or such assignee or assignees, as the case may be). Other than the

      leases, management contracts or other agreements affecting the Purchased
      Assets or that will be binding on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates by

      terminated (or amended, as provided in this <U>Section 3.10(h)</U> with
      respect to the Master Leases) at or prior to the Closing. Without
      limitation on the foregoing, Sellers represent, acknowledge and agree, for
      the benefit of Purchaser, that (i) certain of the Owned Cars may have been
      leased pursuant to a master lease or master rental agreement by one or
      more of the Sellers to EGF Canada or another of the Sellers (any such
      master lease or master rental agreement referred to herein as a "<U>Master
      Lease</U>"), (ii) each such Master Lease shall be deemed to be amended,
      effective immediately prior to the Closing, so that the only liability or
      obligation of the master lessor thereunder is to provide possession of the
      Owned Cars covered thereby to the master lessee thereunder, and the only
      liability or obligation of the master lessee thereunder is to pay rent to
      the master lessor thereunder in an amount equal to the rent received under
      the Owned Car Lease Contracts with respect to such Owned Cars, (iii) such
      amendment to each such Master Lease is effective without the consent or
      approval of any other parties, and (iv) no Person, other than those who
      are Sellers hereunder, has any interest in, or is otherwise entitled to
      any benefits (whether as a third party beneficiary or otherwise) of, any
      such Master Lease.

  Calgary Lease is in full force and effect, and is valid, binding and
  enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by the
  Bankruptcy Exception. All rent and other sums and charges payable under the
  Calgary Lease are current; no written notice of default, termination or breach
  of a condition or limitation has been received by PLM Railcar or any Seller
  with respect to the Calgary Lease; and, to Sellers&#8217; Knowledge, no event or
  condition has occurred or exists that, with written notice or lapse of time,
  would constitute a material breach or a material default of a condition or
  limitation or give rise to a termination by the lessor under the Calgary
  Lease. Sellers have delivered to Purchaser true and correct copies of the
  Calgary Lease and all amendments or modifications thereto. Neither PLM Railcar
  nor Sellers has been notified of any lis pendens or other filings regarding
  the pendency of any litigation or claim affecting the Calgary Lease or the
  leased premises covered thereby. No condemnation or other regulatory
