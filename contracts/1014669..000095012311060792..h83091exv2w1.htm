AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 22, 2011 (this " _Agreement_ "), among Eastman Chemical Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Eastman TC, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and Sterling Chemicals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

  

 A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have approved the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") and Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Preferred Stock_ " and together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ ") not owned by Parent, Sub or the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined herein); 

  

 B. Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; 

  

 C. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") by resolution adopted in accordance with applicable Law, has appointed a special committee of independent members of the Company Board (the " _Special Committee_ "), which has determined that the Merger and this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Resurgence Asset Management, L.L.C., its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates managed funds and accounts (collectively, " _Resurgence_ ")), and has recommended that the Company Board approve this Agreement; 

  

 D. The Company Board, having received the recommendation of the Special Committee, has approved this Agreement and determined that the terms of this Agreement are advisable; 

  

 E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, Resurgence is entering into a voting agreement with Parent with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock and the shares of Preferred Stock owned by Resurgence pursuant to which, among other things, Resurgence has agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to execute and deliver to the Company and Parent a written consent, substantially in the form attached thereto as Exhibit A (the " _Stockholder Consent_ "), pursuant to which Resurgence will adopt this Agreement in accordance with Section 228 and Section 251(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "); and 

  

 F. That, as a condition and inducement to willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, Resurgence has waived certain rights under the Restated Certificate of Designations, Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   ##### 

 

  

I. _THE MERGER_  

   

 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Sub will be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and will succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger, the payments of the Merger Consideration, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " _Transactions_." 

  

 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger will take place at the offices of Jones Day, 1420 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30309 at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_, or, if on such day any condition set forth in _Section 7.02_ or _7.03_ has not been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as may be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company, but in no event will the Closing occur on a date that is earlier than 40 days after the date of this Agreement. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 1.03. _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter Parent will file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (collectively, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and will make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company will agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.04. _Effects_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Sub will become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company will be amended and restated to read in its entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and as so amended will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company will be amended and restated to read in their entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and as so amended will be the 

   ##### 

  

 

bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with the provisions therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 1.06. _Directors_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 1.07. _Officers_. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

II. _EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE_ 
  _CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

   

 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration or other consideration will be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. (i) Subject to _Section 2.01(b)_ and  _Section 2.01(d)_ , (A) each issued and outstanding share (or fraction thereof) of Company Common Stock will be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive $2.50 (or the appropriate fraction thereof, in the case of a fractional share) (the " _Common Stock Consideration_ ") in cash without interest and (B) each issued and outstanding share (or fraction thereof, in the case of a fractional share) of Preferred Stock will be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount equal to the quotient of (A) $100,000,000 minus the sum of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration and the Adjustment Amount and (B) the number of shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared)) in cash without interest (the " _Preferred Stock Consideration_ " and with the Common Stock Consideration collectively referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (i) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Capital Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.02_ , without interest, and except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.01(d)_ with respect to Dissenting Shares and _Section 2.02(c)_ with respect to Unpaid Dividends. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a stockholder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing an appraisal for such shares and otherwise properly perfected and not withdrawn or lost their rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such Dissenting Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under such Section 262 will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in _Section 2.01(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 2.01(c)_, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company will give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 2.02. _Exchange of Shares_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will select a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of a certificate or certificates representing Company Capital Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or transfer of non-certificated shares representing Company Capital Stock (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "), as the case may be. At the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent all the cash necessary to promptly pay for the shares of Company Capital Stock converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") less any Merger Consideration in respect of which the Parent has made alternative provision for payment thereof pursuant to the second sentence of _Section 2.02(b)_ below. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, in exchange for Merger Consideration. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause provision to be made for holders of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company Capital Stock to procure in person immediately after the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and instructions and to cause to be delivered in
person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of transmittal and to
provide immediate payment of the related Merger Consideration against
delivery thereof, to the extent practicable. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as the
case may be, to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the shares of Company Capital Stock theretofore represented
by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share will be converted pursuant to
_Section 2.01_, and the Certificate so surrendered or the Book-Entry Share
or so transferred, as applicable, will forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Capital Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or the Book-
Entry Share so transferred is registered, if such Certificate or such Book-
Entry Share, as applicable, is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
for transfer, if applicable, and the Person requesting such payment will pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or such Book-Entry
Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Except as otherwise identified in _Section
2.01(d)_ and except as otherwise provided with respect to Unpaid Dividends in
_Section 2.02(c)_, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, will be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
_Section 2.02_. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or transfer of any Book-Entry Share. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock (including any accrued and unpaid dividends on the outstanding Preferred Stock (whether or not declared)), subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any other dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with (and not in violation of) the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time (collectively, " _Unpaid Dividends_ "), and after the Effective Time there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered or transferred, as applicable, immediately prior to such date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share would irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent will invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, and/or (iii) securities of an investment company registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. §802 that is (A) a money market fund and (B) is rated "AAA" or better by Standard and Poors, or a combination thereof; provided that, in any such case, no such instrument will have a maturity exceeding three months from the date of the investment therein. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be the property of and will be paid to Parent. In no event will a decline in the value of the Exchange Fund relieve Parent of its obligations under this _Article II_. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under _Section 2.02(a)_, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under _Section 2.02(a)_. 

  

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, which will include indemnities, by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. 

  

 2.03. _Company Stock Options_. Each Option outstanding as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any action on the part of any holder of any 

    ##### 

 

  

Option, whether vested or unvested, exercisable or not exercisable, will be

 5.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.02_ , after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that the Company and its subsidiaries will not, and that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its directors, members of senior management identified in the definition of Knowledge herein, investment bankers, or attorneys (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or its subsidiaries to not, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry regarding, or any proposal or offer which would reasonably be expected to lead to, a merger, acquisition, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer or other transaction involving, or 

   ##### 

  

 

any proposal or offer to purchase or acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, (A) assets (including equity interests of a Company Subsidiary)
representing 20% or more of the assets or revenues of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the voting securities of
the Company, other than, in each case, the Merger or other transactions with
Parent (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) enter into, participate, continue or
otherwise engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-
public information to any Person (other than Parent, Sub and their
Representatives) with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making,
submission or announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into or
approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, option agreement, share
purchase agreement, acquisition agreement or similar agreement for
an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill, confidentiality
agreement or similar Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party; provided, that the foregoing will not prohibit the Company Board
from terminating, waiving, amending or modifying any provision of, or
granting permission under, any standstill, confidentiality agreement or
similar Contract if the Company Board determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action, would be reasonably likely to constitute a
breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law. The Company will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any
Person (other than Parent, Sub or their Representatives) conducted prior to
the date of this Agreement by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives with respect to any actual or potential
Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.02_, the Company may, and may authorize any of its Representatives to, prior to the date that is 40 days following the date of this Agreement, (i) in response to a request by a Person who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated or solicited in violation of _Section 5.02(a)_, provide information to such Person (including to potential financing sources of such Person), if the Company receives from such Person so requesting the information an executed confidentiality agreement no more favorable in any material respect to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent (it being agreed that the Company will promptly provide to Parent, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent); (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person (and such Persons potential financing sources) who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated or solicited in violation of _Section 5.02(a)_; and/or (iii) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Boards recommendation to the Companys stockholders to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger or publicly approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal if, in each case, the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the Special Committee and its advisors and the Companys outside legal counsel that (A) failure to take this action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (B) the Acquisition Proposal, if applicable, either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof (for this purpose substituting "50%" for each reference to 20% in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal") and that the Company Board determines in good faith 

   ##### 

  

 

(after consultation with the Special Committee and its advisors and the
Companys outside legal counsel) is reasonably expected to be consummated on
the terms proposed, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal, including the financing terms thereof and the Person
making such proposal, and if consummated would result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of
view than the Transactions (after taking into account any revisions to the
terms of the Transactions agreed to by Parent pursuant to _Section
5.02(c)_). 

   

 (c) The Company will notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after the Company Board has determined that it has received any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information or inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The written notice will include the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any material written amendments or modifications, or any proposed material written amendments or modifications, thereto), and the Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of any material changes with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company will provide Parent with at least 36 hours prior notice (or such shorter notice as may be provided to the Company Board) of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to determine that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. The Company will not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.01(e)_ hereof, and any purported termination pursuant thereto will be void of no force or effect, until after the fifth business day following Parents receipt from the Company of written notice (i) advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (and attaching a copy of the definitive agreement related thereto, if available) and (ii) stating that the Company intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ (in which case all references to 40 days in _Section 1.02_ and this _Section 5.02_ will be deemed extended for such new five business day period). The Company agrees that after notifying Parent that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, including during the five-business day period specified in the preceding sentence (such period, the " _Parent Review Period_ "), Parent will be permitted to propose to the Company revisions to the terms of the Transactions, and the Company and its Representatives will, if requested by Parent, consider in good faith any revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by Parent. The Company will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ if Parent has, during the Parent Review Period, made a binding offer that, after consideration of such offer by the Company Board in good faith and after consultation with the Special Committee and its advisors and the Companys outside legal counsel, results in the Company Board concluding that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any amendment to the consideration or any other material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.02(c)_ with respect to such new written notice (including a new Parent Review Period except that the new Parent Review Period will be three business days, in which case all references to 40 days in _Section 1.02_ and this  _Section 5.02_ will be deemed extended for such new three business day period). 

  

 (d) The Company agrees that any action taken by any of its subsidiaries or a Representative of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that, if taken by the Company, would 

   ##### 

  

 

constitute a breach of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02_,
will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this _Section
5.02_) by the Company. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ will prohibit the Company or its Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making such disclosure to the Companys stockholders which, in the judgment of the Company Board after receiving advice of outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law. 

  

 5.03. _Transaction Fee_. The Company will pay a Transaction Fee (as defined in the Genova Agreement) to John V. Genova pursuant to the terms of the Genova Agreement. 

  

VI. _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_  

   

 6.01. _Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Information Statement_. In lieu of calling a meeting of the Companys stockholders, the Company will seek approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Stockholder Consent. Such approval will be sought so that such consent will be obtained and effective on the 21st day after the date the Information Statement is first sent or given to the Company stockholders in accordance with Rule 14c-2(b) under the Exchange Act. Subject to _Section 5.02_, the Company Board will recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Companys stockholders. In connection with such action by written consent, the Company will (a) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but no later than 14 days after the date of this Agreement unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the Agreement, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Information Statement and use its commercially reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC and thereafter mail to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable the Information Statement, and (b) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to approvals by its stockholders of this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company will provide Parent and its respective counsel with sufficient opportunity to comment upon the form and substance of the Information Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) prior to filing such with the SEC and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to incorporate Parents reasonable comments into the Information Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto). The Company will promptly provide to Parent copies of any comments received from the SEC in connection therewith and will consult with Parent in responding to the SEC. 

  

 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, lenders, financial advisors and other Representatives of Parent, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all its own and its subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the federal or state securities Laws, including information necessary to satisfy Permit application requirements, and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. The Company will not be required to 

   ##### 

  

 

disclose any information if such disclosure would contravene any applicable
Law or where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under the circumstances in which the restrictions of
the preceding sentence apply. The Company will, within two business days of
request therefor, provide to Parent the information described in Rule
14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act. All information exchanged pursuant to
this _Section 6.02_ will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 6.03. _Reasonable Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the making of all registrations and filings and obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, Consents from Governmental Entities (including in connection with the HSR Act and any other applicable Law) and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, provided, that, Parent will not be required to agree, and the Company will not agree without Parents consent, to waive any rights or accept any limitations on its operations or to dispose of any assets in connection with obtaining any such consent or authorization, but at Parents written request, the Company will agree to any such waiver, limitation or disposal, which agreement may, at the Companys option, be conditioned upon and effective as of the Effective Time, (ii) the responding to any information requests from Governmental Entities as soon as reasonably practicable, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary Consents or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, (i) the Company will promptly furnish Parent with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, (ii) the Company will promptly furnish such necessary information and reasonable assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing, and (iii) the Company and Parent and their respective counsel will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. The Company and Parent will provide 

   ##### 

  

 

the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation
or other inquiry in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions. 

   

 (b) The Company will give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Sub will give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification will affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

  

 6.04. _Employees and Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) _Salary and Wages_. The Surviving Corporation will cause the Company to continue the employment effective immediately after the Closing Date of all of the Companys employees, including each such employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of absence as of the Closing Date. All such retained employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries who are employed by the Company and Company Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing Date are referred to as " _Retained Employees_." The continued employment immediately following the Closing Date of each such Retained Employee will be on substantially similar terms and conditions, and in each case will provide at least the same base wages or annual base salary, annual rate of bonus potential (determined as a percentage of annual base salary), vacation accrual, vacation banking and 401(k) match (but excluding any equity plan program or arrangement) provided to each such Retained Employee on the Closing Date for a period not to extend beyond December 31, 2011;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for the year ending December 31, 2012, each such Retained Employee will be entitled to receive the equivalent of the greater of (i) the 401(k) match such Retained Employee would be eligible to receive under the Companys 401(k) plan or (ii) the amount payable under the terms of Parents Investment and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, as amended and restated. Nothing in this _Section 6.04(a_) will obligate Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Company to continue the employment of any such Retained Employee for any specific period. 

  

 (b) _Employee Benefits_. As of the Closing Date and for a period not to extend beyond December 31, 2011, Parent will provide, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, each Retained Employee with employee benefits (excluding any equity based compensation or any Parent sponsored severance benefit) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to similarly situated employees of Parent. As of the Closing Date and for a period not to extend beyond December 31, 2011, in the event that a Retained Employee terminates employment from the Surviving Corporation after the Closing, Parent will provide, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, each such Retained Employee with severance benefits, if eligible therefor, equal to those provided under a Plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Retained Employees will retain after the Closing all benefits under the Companys Fifth Amended and Restated Severance Pay 

   ##### 

  

 

Plan for a period following the Effective Time until December 31, 2012, which
Plan will not be amended or modified by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
until the expiration of such period. 

   

 (c) _Employee Service Credit_. Parent (i) will give, or cause the Surviving Corporation to give, each Retained Employee service credit granted by the Company prior to Closing under any comparable Company benefit plan solely for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in eligible benefits provided that Retained Employees will in all events only be eligible to participate in a Parent employee benefit plan based on benefits available to similarly situated employees as if hired by Parent as of the Closing Date (which for the avoidance of doubt does not include service credit for a benefit in any Parent defined benefit pension plan or retiree health or retiree welfare benefit plan), (ii) will give, or cause the Surviving Corporation to give, each Retained Employee service credit granted by the Company prior to Closing under any comparable personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee after the Closing Date, including any vacation and sick leave, for purposes of entitlement to vacation and sick leave, (iii) will allow such Retained Employees to participate in each plan providing welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance, long-term disability insurance and long-term care insurance) in the plan year in which the Closing occurs without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the corresponding Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iv) if any of the Welfare Plans are terminated prior to the end of the plan year that includes the Closing Date, Parent will credit the Retained Employee with any expenses that were covered by the Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under any similar replacement plans. 

  

 (d) _Labor Agreements_. As of and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or its relevant Subsidiaries will continue (for so long as such Contracts are in effect) to be bound by the Collective Bargaining Agreements. 

  

 (e) _COBRA_. The Surviving Corporation will be responsible for providing COBRA to employees and former employees of the Company and their dependents who are entitled to COBRA under the terms of the Companys health plan as of the Closing. 

  

 (f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement will create any right or obligation which is enforceable by any employee, former employee, Retained Employee or any other Person with respect to any terms or conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, the benefits and compensation described in this _Section 6.04_. For the avoidance of doubt, any amendments to the Companys, the Company Subsidiaries, Parents and the Surviving Corporations benefit and compensation plans, programs or arrangements will occur only in accordance with their respective terms and will be pursuant to action taken by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent and the Surviving Corporation which are independent of the consummation of this Agreement or any continuing obligations hereunder. 

  

 6.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the current or former directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company (the " _Covered Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses (including attorneys 

   ##### 

  

 

fees and disbursements), Judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (in
the case of settlements, with the approval of the indemnifying party (which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld)) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as
incurred (payable monthly upon written request which request will include
reasonable evidence of the Losses set forth therein) to the extent arising
from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in connection with such
indemnified partys duties as an officer or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, as a member of any committee thereof, or serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
fiduciary, employee or agent of an employee benefit plan or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
in respect of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. 

   

 (b) Parent will, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the Companys obligations to indemnify the Covered Persons for acts or omissions by such Covered Persons occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the advancement of funds and expenses to the extent provided under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or individual indemnity or other agreements to which such Covered Persons are a party as in effect on the date hereof subject to the reimbursement provisions thereof), and such obligations will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and such individual indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such Covered Persons arising out of such acts or omissions. Parent will, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to advance funds for expenses incurred by Covered Persons so indemnified in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding relating to the indemnification obligations referenced in the immediately preceding sentence in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking made in accordance with the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and individual indemnity agreements (unless otherwise prohibited by Law) by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it will be ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to the indemnification referenced in the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent will not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 300% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent will maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 

  

 (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its 

   

\- 36 - 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will assume all of
the applicable obligations set forth in _Section 6.04_ and this _Section
6.05_. 

   

 (e) _Withholding_.

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement will be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment will relieve Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

 9.10. _Specific Performance; Enforcement_.
