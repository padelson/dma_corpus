(such stockholders collectively being referred to herein as the "PRINCIPAL
STOCKHOLDERS");

Sub's entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth
herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the

SECTION 3.09(b)(ii) BELOW) have entered into an agreement (the "NOTE AGREEMENT")
pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the 7.5% Subordinated Note Holders
have agreed not to require the repayment of the 7.5% Subordinated Notes until
the earliest to occur of (A) the consummation of the Merger, (B) the termination
of the Merger Agreement, and (C) the Drop Dead Date (as defined below); (ii) the
7.5% Subordinated Note Holders have agreed that if the Merger has not been
consummated or the Agreement terminated prior to December 31, 2001, the Demand

                  WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger
Sub's entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth
herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         SECTION 1.01.     THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation Article

SECTION 1.02), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result

and in any event within three Business Days, following the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (or such other
date as may be agreed upon by each of the parties hereto) (other than the
delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the
delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the
Closing), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of

effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at
such later time on the day of such filing as is specified in the Certificate of

place as the parties may agree). The date on which the Closing shall occur is
referred to herein as the "CLOSING DATE."

         SECTION 1.03.     EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time (i) all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 1.04.     CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS.

         (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by law and such certificate of
incorporation; provided, however, that such certificate of incorporation may
only be amended with respect to the exculpation and indemnification of the
Company Indemnified Parties in accordance with the terms of SECTION 6.11 hereof.

         (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and

<PAGE>   8
such bylaws; provided, however, that such bylaws shall be amended to change all
references to the name of the Merger Sub to refer to the name of the Surviving
Corporation.

         SECTION 1.05.     DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. At the Effective Time, the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

                                   ARTICLE II

                 MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         SECTION 2.01.     MERGER CONSIDERATION.

         (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, pursuant to this Agreement and the DGCL:

         (i) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
      immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled
      in accordance with SECTION 2.01(a)(iii) and any Dissenting Shares (as
      defined in SECTION 2.05(a)) shall be converted into the right to receive
      the Common Stock Merger Consideration (as defined in SECTION 10.02(a))
      payable, without interest, except as provided by SECTION 2.03(g) and
      SECTION 9.02(c), to the holder of such share of Company Common Stock each
      a "COMMON HOLDER" and collectively the "COMMON HOLDERS"), upon surrender,
      in the manner provided in SECTION 2.02, of the certificate that formerly
      evidenced such share. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
      Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
      cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
      representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
      any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common
      Stock Merger Consideration;


         (ii) each share of Series H Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
      immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares)
      shall be converted into the right to receive the Series H Merger
      Consideration (as defined in SECTION 10.02(a)), payable, without interest,
      to the holder of such share of Series H Preferred Stock, upon surrender,
      in the manner provided in SECTION 2.02, of the certificate that formerly
      evidenced such share. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Series
      H Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
      be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
      representing any such shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall cease to
      have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
      Series H Merger Consideration;

         (iii) each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of the
      Company and each share of Company Stock owned by Parent or any direct or
      indirect wholly owned




                                       4

<PAGE>   9

      subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
      Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or
      exchange thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
      thereto; and

         (iv) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
      Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
      shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
      and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.00004 per share, of
      the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) The Company shall cause Alpharma to issue the Call Option Rejection
Notice, such Call Option Rejection Notice to be effective immediately after the
Effective Time, thereby entitling the Depositary Holders to receive the Common
Stock Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Depositary Receipts
attributable to the Depositary Shares. After the Effective Time, Parent will
take such action with the Depositary as is reasonably necessary to cause the
Common Stock Merger Consideration deposited with the Depositary as the sole
holder of record of the Company Common Stock to be paid to the holders of the
Depositary Receipts.

         SECTION 2.02.     PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.

         (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate the Depositary
or such other bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to
act as agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for the holders of shares of Company Stock to
receive the Initial Merger Consideration to which holders of Company Stock shall
become entitled hereunder. On or prior to the Closing, Parent shall transfer to
the Paying Agent the cash, subject to SECTION 2.02(g), necessary to pay the
Aggregate Initial Common Stock Consideration and the Aggregate Series H Merger
Consideration. The Contingent Payments (as defined in SECTION 2.03(a)), if
earned, shall be paid as provided in SECTION 2.02(d). The Excess Warrant
Proceeds (as defined in SECTION 2.04(b)), if any, shall be paid as provided in
SECTION 2.02(f). All funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall be invested by
the Paying Agent in (i) certificates of deposits in or repurchase agreements
from United States commercial banks having capital resources in excess of $1
billion, (ii) obligations of the United States government or any agency thereof,
(iii) obligations guaranteed by the United States government, (iv) in money
market accounts in financial institutions having capital resources in excess of
$1 billion or (v) as otherwise provided in the agreement entered into between
the Paying Agent, Parent and the Company; provided, however, that all such
investments will be in short term, highly liquid investments. Parent shall pay
the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

         (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record
of shares of Company Stock entitled to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to SECTION 2.01(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates or Depositary Receipts evidencing such shares of Company Stock (the
"CERTIFICATES") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of


                                       5

<PAGE>   10

such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration. Provision shall be made for holders
of Certificates or Depositary Receipts evidencing such shares of Company Stock
to procure in person immediately after the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and to deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time such
letter of transmittal and Certificates or Depositary Receipts in exchange for
that portion of the Initial Merger Consideration to which such holders are
entitled hereunder.

         (c) Except as provided in SECTION 2.03(g) or SECTION 9.02(c), no
interest shall accrue or be paid on the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration. If the payment equal to the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company Stock is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established
to the satisfaction of Parent that such taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.

         (d) Simultaneous with the occurrence of any of the following events (i)
the delivery of each Net Sales Statement (as defined in SECTION 2.03(b) below),
(ii) the resolution of any dispute regarding the amount of any Contingent
Payment pursuant to SECTION 2.03(d), (iii) the determination that additional
amounts are payable pursuant to SECTION 2.03(h) or (iv) the resolution of any
dispute regarding the amount of any setoff pursuant to SECTION 9.03, Parent
shall transfer to the Paying Agent the cash necessary to pay the amount of any
earned Contingent Payment, if any, without interest, and shall cause the Paying
Agent to promptly distribute to the Common Holders the Contingent Payment to
which such Common Holders are entitled.

         (e) At any time following six months after the Initial Merger
Consideration, a Contingent Payment or a payment of Excess Warrant Proceeds has
been transferred to the Paying Agent, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been transferred to the Paying
Agent with respect to the Initial Merger Consideration, such Contingent Payment
or such payment of Excess Warrant Proceeds, as applicable, and not disbursed to
holders of shares of Company Stock (including, without limitation, all interest
and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it, if any). Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to any applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration that may be payable to them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a share of Company Stock for any applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration properly delivered in respect of such share of Company Stock to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
law.

         (f) Within five Business Days of any exercise of Out-of-the-Money
Warrants (as defined in SECTION 2.04(b) below), including the payment to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation of the exercise price therefor, Parent shall
transfer to the Paying Agent the cash necessary to pay the Excess Warrant
Proceeds (as defined in SECTION 2.04(b)(ii)), if any, resulting from the


                                       6


<PAGE>   11

exercise of such Out-of-the-Money Warrants, without interest, and shall cause
the Paying Agent to promptly distribute to the Common Holders the Excess Warrant
Proceeds to which such Common Holders are entitled.

         (g) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock, or Company Stock Options (as defined in
SECTION 2.04(a) below) on the records of the Company. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Company Stock prior to the Effective Time which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Per Share Merger
Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Stock, except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable law, and other than the right to receive upon
surrender of the applicable Company Stock, the Per Share Merger Consideration.
After the Effective Time, no dividends, interest or other distributions shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered shares of Company Stock. The applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
surrendered Company Stock.

         (h) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Common Holder or Series H Holder (collectively, the "COMPANY
STOCKHOLDERS") such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "CODE"), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

         (i) All cash amounts payable to a holder of Company Stock shall be
rounded upward to the nearest whole cent and shall be paid to the Company
Stockholders by the Paying Agent by check or wire transfer in immediately
available funds (in accordance with the Paying Agent's customary practice)
pursuant to the written payment instructions delivered by each Company
Stockholder to the Paying Agent upon surrender of such Company Stockholder's
Certificate.

         (j) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent, subject to such other conditions as the Paying
Agent may reasonably impose (including the posting of an indemnity bond or other
surety in favor of Parent with respect to the Certificate alleged to be lost,
stolen or destroyed), shall be authorized to accept an affidavit from the record
holder of such Certificate in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent
and upon receipt of such affidavit issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

         SECTION 2.03.     ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS.

         (a) CONTINGENT PAYMENTS. Parent shall pay to the Common Holders as
additional consideration for the shares of Company Common Stock additional
amounts, if earned, in accordance with the following terms (each such amount
being referred to individually as a "CONTINGENT PAYMENT" and, together with the
Premium Adjustment, as defined below, the "CONTINGENT PAYMENTS"):

         (i) an amount (such amount, the "FIRST CONTINGENT PAYMENT") equal to
      (A) the product of (x) the Premium Base Amount for the first Premium Year
      multiplied by (y) 1.05 less (B) the Contingent Payment Adjustments (as
      defined in SECTION 10.02(a) below). "PREMIUM BASE AMOUNT" means the amount
      that equals (A) the lesser of (i) Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and
      (ii) the amount by which Net Sales (as defined in SECTION 10.02(a) below)
      exceeds Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) plus (B) the Divestiture
      Amount (as defined in SECTION 10.02(a) below), if any, less (C) any
      setoffs, if any, pursuant to SECTION 9.02(c);

         (ii) an amount (such amount, the "SECOND CONTINGENT PAYMENT") equal to
      (A) the product of (x) the Premium Base Amount for the second Premium Year
      multiplied by (y) 1.10 less (B) the Contingent Payment Adjustments;

         (iii) an amount (such amount, the "THIRD CONTINGENT PAYMENT") equal to
      (A) the product of (x) the Premium Base Amount for the third Premium Year
      multiplied by (y) 1.15 less (B) the Contingent Payment Adjustments;

         (iv) an amount (such amount, the "FOURTH CONTINGENT PAYMENT") equal to
      (A) the product of (x) the Premium Base Amount for the fourth Premium Year
      multiplied by (y) 1.20 less (B) the Contingent Payment Adjustments;

         (v) an amount (such amount, the "FIFTH CONTINGENT PAYMENT") equal to
      (A) the product of (x) the Premium Base Amount for the fifth Premium Year
      multiplied by (y) 1.25 less (B) the Contingent Payment Adjustments;

         (vi) an additional amount (the "PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT") equal to (A) the
      amount by which the result of (x) the aggregate Net Sales, plus (y) the
      aggregate Divestiture Amounts, in each case for Premium Years one through
      five, less (z) all amounts, if any, set off pursuant to SECTION 9.02(c),
      exceeds (B) the sum of (x) $125,000,000 and (y) the aggregate Premium Base
      Amount for Premium Years one through five, in which event the Premium
      Adjustment would equal the lesser of such amount and $50,000,000;
      provided, however, that in no event shall the sum of the aggregate Premium
      Base Amount for Premium Years one through five and the Premium Adjustment
      exceed $50,000,000. An example of the calculations made in this SECTION
      2.03(a) is provided as EXHIBIT A hereto.

         (vii) Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, Alpharma has the right to
      receive 2% of the aggregate Consideration (as defined therein) in excess
      of $65.0 million, in the event of a Change of Control of the Company (as
      defined therein). Therefore, Parent shall pay to Alpharma from time to
      time an amount equal to 2% of the amount that would


                                       8


<PAGE>   13
      have been the Contingent Payments if no payment had been made to Alpharma,
      from and after the initial $5.0 million in Contingent Payments paid to
      Common Holders pursuant to this SECTION 2.03 (the "ALPHARMA PAYMENTS")
      instead of such amount being paid to the former Common Holders. Parent
      shall make such payments to Alpharma on a parity with and at the same time
      Parent transfers funds for the Contingent Payments to the Paying Agent. No
      calculation in this SECTION 2.03(a)(vii) shall impact the calculations
      made pursuant to SECTIONS 2.03(a)(i)-(vi), the parties hereto agreeing
      that the purpose of this SECTION 2.03(a)(vii) shall be to pay to Alpharma
      a portion of the Contingent Payments that would otherwise be paid to the
      former Common Holders.

         (b) NET SALES STATEMENTS. For each Premium Year, Parent shall prepare a
statement (each a "NET SALES STATEMENT") setting forth the Net Sales of each
Pediatric Product (which Net Sales Statement shall also list unit quantities,
the Net Sales amount of Pediatric Products shipped by Parent, its subsidiaries,
affiliates, licensees or sublicensees by product and the Net Sales Deductions
per Pediatric Product, aggregated by category, made) for the Premium Year to
which such Net Sales Statement relates. Within forty-five (45) calendar days
following the end of each Premium Year, Parent shall deliver to the Calculation
Representative (as defined in SECTION 9.04) a copy of the Net Sales Statement
for such Premium Year, along with a calculation of the related Contingent
Payment, if any, including all amounts, if any, setoff pursuant to SECTION
9.02(c) below or adjusted pursuant to the Contingent Payment Adjustments). In
the event that Parent determines according to this SECTION 2.03 that a
Contingent Payment is not to be paid during a Premium Year, Parent shall as
promptly as practicable notify the Calculation Representative in writing of such
fact, which notice shall describe the basis of Parent's determination. In
addition, Parent shall provide notification to the Common Holders, by press
release or otherwise, of the amount of any Contingent Payment earned, if any, or
if no Contingent Payment was earned, of such fact. The Calculation
Representative shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its agents,
representatives, affiliates, stockholders, employees, officers and directors
(the Calculation Representative and such Persons being referred to as the
"RECEIVING PARTIES"), to treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or
provide access to any Person) all information contained and relating to the Net
Sales Statements; provided, however, that this obligation shall not apply to any
information which:

         (i) either before or after the date of disclosure to the Receiving
      Parties becomes generally known to the public by some means other than a
      breach of this SECTION 2.03(b);

         (ii) is subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Parties by a third
      party having a lawful right to make such disclosure and who is not under
      an obligation of confidentiality to Parent;

         (iii) is independently developed by or for the Receiving Party without
      reference to or reliance upon any information received from Parent; or

         (iv) is required by law, rule, regulation or bona fide legal process
      (including any arbitration proceeding pursuant to SECTION 2.03(d) below)
      to be disclosed, provided that the Receiving Party takes reasonable steps
      to restrict and maintain the confidentiality of such information and
      provides reasonable notice to Parent.


                                       9

<PAGE>   14

         (c) ASSIGNABILITY. The right of each Common Holder to receive payments
pursuant to SECTION 2.03 may not be transferred or assigned except by operation
of law or by will or intestate succession.

         (d) DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION. In the event that any dispute,
controversy or claim that arises in connection with this SECTION 2.03, such
dispute, controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with
the following:

         (i) The Parent and the Calculation Representative shall attempt in good
      faith to resolve promptly through negotiations any claim or dispute under
      this SECTION 2.03. If any such dispute, controversy or claim should arise,
      Parent and the Calculation Representative shall meet once (or more if
      mutually agreed) to attempt to resolve the matter (the "SETTLEMENT
      MEETING"). Either Parent or the Calculation Representative may request the
      other to attend a Settlement Meeting at a mutually agreed time and place
      within ten (10) days after delivery of a written notice of a dispute,
      controversy or claim. The occurrence of a Settlement Meeting with respect
      to a dispute, controversy or claim shall be a condition precedent to
      instituting an arbitration proceeding with respect to a claim or dispute
      under this SECTION 2.03, provided that if Parent or the Calculation
      Representative refuses to attend a Settlement Meeting the other party may
      proceed to institute an arbitration proceeding as provided below.

         (ii) Applicable Rules. A panel of three arbitrators shall conduct the
      arbitration proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the Federal
      Arbitration Act (99 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq.) (the "FEDERAL ARBITRATION
      ACT") and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
      Association (the "ARBITRATION RULES"). The arbitration shall be held in
      New York, New York.

         (iii) Initiation of Arbitration. To submit a dispute, controversy or
      claim to arbitration, either Parent or the Calculation Representative
      shall furnish to the other and the American Arbitration Association a
      notice (the "ARBITRATION NOTICE") containing (A) the name and address of
      the complaining party, (B) the nature of the dispute, controversy or claim
      in reasonable detail, (C) their intent to commence arbitration proceeding
      under this Agreement and (D) the other information required under the
      Federal Arbitration Act and the Arbitration Rules.

         (iv) Selection of Arbitrators. Within twenty Business Days after
      delivery of the Arbitration Notice, Purchaser and the Calculation
      Representative shall each select one arbitrator. Within ten Business Days
      after the selection of the last of those two arbitrators, those two
      arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator from the list of the
      American Arbitration Association's National Panel of Commercial
      Arbitrators (the "PANEL LIST"). If the first two arbitrators cannot select
      a third arbitrator within such ten Business Day period, the American
      Arbitration Association shall select such third arbitrator from the list.
      Each arbitrator shall be an individual not subject to disqualification
      under Rule No. 19 (or any successor rule) of the Arbitration Rules (or any
      successor rule).


                                       10

<PAGE>   15

         (v) Discovery. During the period beginning with the selection of the
      third arbitrator and ending upon the conclusion of the arbitration
      proceedings, the arbitrators shall have the authority to permit the
      parties to conduct such discovery as the arbitrators consider appropriate.
      The decision of a majority of the panel shall be the decision of the
      arbitrators.

         (vi) Judgments. The determination of the arbitrators as to the
      resolution of the dispute, controversy or claim shall be final and binding
      and conclusive to the maximum extent permitted by law. Judgment upon the
      award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having
      jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate is irrevocable.

         (vii) Acknowledgement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
      the rights and restrictions set forth in this SECTION 2.03, including but
      not limited to the amount of and the method for calculating the Contingent
      Payments and the method of resolving disputes set forth in this SECTION
      2.03(d), have been bargained for at arms length, and constitute essential
      terms to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (e) CONTINGENT PAYMENTS NOT ROYALTIES. The Contingent Payments provided
for pursuant to this SECTION 2.03 are provided as a result of bona fide
difficulties in determining the value of the Company. The Contingent Payments
represent additional consideration for the Company Stock and are not intended to
be royalty payments.

         (f) FEES AND EXPENSES. Any reasonable fees and expenses incurred by any
party in connection with resolving any dispute, claim or controversy under this
SECTION 2.03, including, without limitation, any legal fees or fees and expenses
incurred in connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to SECTION
2.03(d), shall be borne by such party; provided, however, in the event that the
Parent is the prevailing party, the reasonable legal fees or fees and expenses
incurred by the Parent shall be setoff against any future Contingent Payments;
and provided, further, that in the event that the Calculation Representative is
the prevailing party, the reasonable legal fees or expenses incurred by the
Calculation Representative shall be paid by the Parent. The question of which
party is the prevailing party shall be submitted to the arbitrators as part of
the arbitration proceeding.

         (g) LATE PAYMENTS; COLLECTIONS. Any amount not paid when due under this
SECTION 2.03 shall bear interest at the lesser of (i) five percent (5%) per
annum compounded annually, or (ii) the highest rate permitted by Law.

         (h) BOOKS AND RECORDS; AUDITS. For a period of not less than three (3)
years after the relevant Premium Year, Parent, its subsidiaries, affiliates,
licensees and sublicensees shall keep full, true and accurate books of account
sufficient to determine the amounts payable pursuant to this SECTION 2.03. The
Calculation Representative shall have the right, not more than once during any
calendar year, to have the books and records of Parent, its subsidiaries,
affiliates, licensees or sublicensees audited by a qualified independent
accounting firm of its choosing, under appropriate confidentiality provisions,
to ascertain the accuracy of the reports and payments under this SECTION 2.03
and compliance by Parent, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensees or
sublicensees with its obligations under this SECTION 2.03. Such audit shall be
conducted upon at least ten (10) days' advance notice during normal business
hours and in a



                                       11

<PAGE>   16

manner that does not interfere unreasonably with the business of the audited
entity. Subject to Parent's right to dispute such amounts in accordance with
SECTION 2.03(d), any underpayment determined by such audit shall promptly be
paid by Parent. If Parent has underpaid an amount due under SECTION 2.03 by more
than ten percent (10%), Parent shall reimburse the Calculation Representative
for the cost of such audit (with the cost of the audit to be borne by the
Calculation Representative in all other cases).

         SECTION 2.04.     COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

         (a) Subject to the consummation of the Merger, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all necessary action (i) to amend the Company's
1997 Director Stock Option Plan to provide that all shares of Company Stock
subject to outstanding options under the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan shall
become fully vested and exercisable, whether or not previously vested and
exercisable prior to the Effective Time, and all such options not exercised
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and no options granted pursuant
to the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan will be outstanding at or after the
Effective Time (such amendment to be approved by the Company's Board of
Directors and by each Person who holds an option granted under the 1997 Director
Stock Option Plan in his or her individual capacity); (ii) with respect to all
options granted and outstanding under each of the Company's Amended and Restated
1992 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company's 1997 Director Stock Option Plan, the
Company's 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company's Amended and Restated
1999 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company's Amended and Restated 2000 California
Stock Option Plan (collectively, with the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the
"COMPANY STOCK PLANS"), to accelerate the vesting and exercisability of
outstanding options and rights to purchase Company Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans (each, a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION"), whether or not such
Company Stock Options were previously vested and exercisable prior to the
Effective Time; (iii) to take such actions as provided under the Company's 1997
Employee Stock Purchase Plan to cause options granted thereunder to become
exercisable as of a date established by the Company's Board of Directors prior
to the Effective Time; (iv) to permit each holder of a Company Stock Option
(each, a "COMPANY OPTIONHOLDER") to exercise all of his Company Stock Options
which are fully vested and exercisable, including as a result of aforementioned
acceleration, prior to the Effective Time; (v) to take all action necessary,
including, without limitation, obtaining consents of and providing written
notice to the Company Optionholders to the extent necessary, to provide that all
Company Stock Options not so exercised shall be cancelled and that no Company
Stock Options will be outstanding at or after the Effective Time; and (vi) to
terminate the Company Stock Plans as of the Effective Time.

         (b) In the event that at any time from and after the Effective Time a
holder of warrants to purchase any Company equity securities (such warrants, the
"COMPANY WARRANTS" and such holders, the "COMPANY WARRANT HOLDERS") that are not
In-the-Money Warrants (as defined in SECTION 10.02(a) below) ("OUT-OF-THE-MONEY
WARRANTS") properly exercises Out-of-the-Money Warrants ("EXERCISED WARRANTS")
and delivers the exercise price for such Exercised Warrants to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, then

         (i) the portion (the "ALLOCATED CONSIDERATION") of the aggregate
      exercise price of such Exercised Warrants equal to the Common Stock Merger
      Consideration paid by


                                       12

<PAGE>   17
      Parent to Common Holders pursuant to SECTION 2.02 prior to such exercise
      with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which
      such Exercised Warrants are exercised shall be repaid to the Person that
      exercises such Exercised Warrants (or upon the mutual agreement of Parent
      and such Person, shall be deducted from the exercise price actually paid
      by such Person to Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with
      such exercise);

         (ii) Parent shall pay to the Common Holders, in accordance with SECTION
      2.02(f), an amount (the "EXCESS WARRANT PROCEEDS") equal to the amount by
      which (A) the aggregate exercise price of such Exercised Warrants exceeds
      (B) the Allocated Consideration; and

         (iii) with respect to any payment made to Common Holders following the
      exercise of such Exercised Warrants and the payment by Parent of the
      Excess Warrant Proceeds with respect to the exercise of such Exercised
      Warrants, (A) the Person exercising such Exercised Warrants shall be
      deemed a Common Holder for purposes of this Agreement, and (B) the Per
      Share Denominator (as defined below) shall be adjusted in accordance with
      the definition of such term.

         The parties acknowledge that the purpose of this SECTION 2.04(b) is to
allocate the exercise price of the Exercised Warrants among the holders of such
Exercised Warrants and the holders of Common Stock in a manner that has the same
result as if such Exercised Warrants had been exercised prior to the Effective
Time.

         SECTION 2.05.     DISSENTING SHARES.

         (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by Company Stockholders as of the Effective Time who have
exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their right to such appraisal
(collectively, the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in SECTION 10.02(a)
below). Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Stock held by them in accordance with
DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall
have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Stock under DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the occurrence of such event, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
provided by SECTION 2.01, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in SECTION 2.02, of the Certificates that formerly evidenced
such shares of Company Stock.

         (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands received by the
Company, and any other related instruments served pursuant to DGCL and received
by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under DGCL. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent



                                       13

<PAGE>   18

(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle
any such demands. Except as provided in SECTION 2.05(a), holders of Dissenting
Shares shall not be entitled to receive their Merger Consideration and such
Merger Consideration shall be retained by Parent.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the
"COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that the statements contained in this Article III are true and
correct as of the date hereof. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged
in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in
this Article III and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify (1) the
corresponding paragraph in this Article III and (2) the other paragraphs in this
Article III only to the extent that it is clear from a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other paragraphs. The
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:



                                       14

<PAGE>   19

         SECTION 3.01.     ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such power and authority would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be
so qualified or licensed or in good standing that have not had, and would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company

there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect and (b) the Company has

Company, is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement
agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order,

         SECTION 3.12.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; LABOR MATTERS.

         (a) SECTION 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true
and complete list of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and
all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical, disability or life insurance, supplemental
retirement, severance or other material benefit plans, programs or arrangements
(other than the Company Stock Plans), and all employment (other than oral
employment agreements that are terminable at will), termination, severance or
other similar contracts or agreements pursuant to which services are provided to
the Company, whether oral or written, whether legally enforceable or not, to
which the Company is a party, or with respect to which the Company has any
obligation to, or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the
Company or any entity which is a part of a "controlled group of corporations"
with, under "common control" with, or a member of an "affiliated service group"
with the Company as such terms are defined in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") for the benefit, of any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company (collectively, the "COMPANY BENEFIT
PLANS").

         (b) Each Company Benefit Plan is in writing, the Company has furnished
or made available to Parent with a true and complete copy of each Company
Benefit Plan, including, without limitation, (i) a copy of each trust, annuity
contract or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description
("SPD") and summary of material modifications and summaries, if any, furnished
or made available to employees, officers and directors of the Company of all
incentive compensation, other plans and fringe benefits for which SPDs are not
required, (iii) the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 5500, if any, for the
most recently completed fiscal year, (iv) the most recently received IRS
determination letter for each such


                                       21

<PAGE>   26

Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,
(v) the actuarial report and certified financial statements in connection with
each such Company Benefit Plan, if applicable, for the most recently completed
three fiscal years, (vi) any correspondence with the IRS or the Department of
Labor with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan, (vii) each administrative
or other services agreement or contract in effect prior to the Closing Date and
any amendments thereto effective as of a later date, and (viii) the
notifications to employees of their rights under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder ("COBRA").

         (c) None of the Company Benefit Plans is a multiemployer plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or
a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
ERISA) for which the Company could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN"). None of the Company Benefit Plans provides
for or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company except as
required by applicable Law. No Company Benefit Plans are self-insured "multiple
employer welfare arrangements" as such term is defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA.

         (d) None of the Company Benefit Plans provides for the payment of
separation, severance, change of control, termination or similar-type benefits
to any person or obligates the Company to pay separation, severance,
termination, change of control or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a
result of the Transactions or as a result of a "change in control", within the
meaning of such term under any Company Benefit Plan or Section 280G of the Code.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions, either alone or together with another event, will (i) result in
any payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise)
becoming due under any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan or other arrangement, (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, (iv) affect in any respects any Company
Benefit Plan's current treatment under any Laws, including any tax or social
contribution Law or (v) give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(1), 162(m) and/or 280G of
the Code or would require the payment of an excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the Code or any "gross up" of any such excise tax.

         (e) Each Company Benefit Plan is now and always has been operated in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws (including the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder),
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Company has performed all
material obligations required to be performed by it under, and is not in any
material respect in default under or in violation of, the Company Benefit Plans.
No action, claim or proceeding is pending or, to the Company's knowledge,
threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course). None of the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is
subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any Company Benefit Plan under
Section 402(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code.

<PAGE>   27

         (f) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS considering the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as
amended, and subsequent changes in the law or applicable regulations covering
all of the provisions applicable to the Company Benefit Plan for which
determination letters are currently available, that the Company Benefit Plan is
so qualified and each trust established in connection with any Company Benefit
Plan that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is
so exempt, and to the Company's knowledge, no fact or event has occurred since
the date of such determination letter or letters from the IRS considering the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended, to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

         (g) The Company has not incurred any material unsatisfied liability
under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability
for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary
course), including, without limitation, any liability in connection with (i) the
termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan. All "benefit liabilities" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of
ERISA are fully funded with respect to each applicable Company Benefit Plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA as determined on a termination basis using
the assumed interest rate set forth in each Company Benefit Plan or otherwise
required by ERISA or the Code.

         (h) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made or
accrued with respect to any Company Benefit Plan prior to the date hereof have
been made on or before their due dates. All such contributions made for open
taxable years of the Company and for which Tax Returns (as defined below) have
been filed have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such
deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and,
to the Company's knowledge, no fact or event exists which would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

         (i) The Company does not have any Company Benefit Plan that is not
subject to United States Law.

         (j) The Company is not and never has been a party to or otherwise bound
by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization. The Company is not the
subject of any proceeding asserting that the Company has committed an unfair
labor practice or seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor
organization, nor is there pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, any labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-down or
lockout involving the Company.

         (k) As of the date hereof, SECTION 3.12(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of the names, titles, annual
salaries and all compensation pursuant to any commission or bonus plan or

Intellectual Property and the Licensed Intellectual Property in connection with
the operation of the business of the Company as currently conducted, and (B) the

<PAGE>   32
the Company or planned to be conducted by the Company (including the
manufacture, use or sale of the future products which are the subject of Company
Ongoing Clinical Programs for any clinical indications) infringes, violates or
constitutes a misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property rights of any other

Company's knowledge, the Owned Intellectual Property and the Licensed
Intellectual Property are issued, granted or pending (to the extent such
concepts are applicable) and are otherwise in good standing, all without
challenge of any kind, and are valid and enforceable, and have not been adjudged
invalid or unenforceable (except for challenges to validity that may be received
in the ordinary course of the prosecution of patent applications in patent
offices) in whole or part and the Company is unaware of any fact which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be argued to detrimentally
affect the validity, ownership or enforceability of any item of the Owned
Intellectual Property or the Licensed Intellectual Property.

activity that infringes or misappropriates the Owned Intellectual Property or
the Licensed Intellectual Property. With respect to the Company's rights in the
Owned Intellectual Property or the Company's right to use the Licensed
Intellectual Property, the consummation of the Transactions will not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Material Adverse Effect. The term "PARENT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any
change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that is materially adverse
to the business, properties, operations, financial condition and results of
operations of Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or materially impairs
or delays the ability of Parent to perform its material obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger; provided, however, that none of the
following shall be deemed, singly or in the aggregate, to constitute, or be
considered in determining whether there exists, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect: any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts resulting from
(i) any factors generally affecting the healthcare or pharmaceutical industry,
(ii) any factors generally affecting general economic conditions or the
securities markets, (iii) acts or omissions of the Company, including without
limitation acts or omissions contemplated by or pursuant to this Agreement; (iv)
acts or omissions of Parent or Merger Sub contemplated by or pursuant to this
Agreement; and (v) the pendency or announcement of the Merger.

Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any of the provisions of their
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

         SECTION 4.03.     AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and
the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the filing of appropriate merger documents as required by
the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exception.

         SECTION 4.04.     CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement does not, the consummation by Parent and Merger
of the Transactions will not, and the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations hereunder will not:

registration, filing with or notification of any Governmental Authority that, if
not obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; or

         (c) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default (with
or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, forfeiture, cancellation or acceleration, transfer fees or
guaranteed payments or a loss of a material benefit under, or require a consent,
waiver or approval under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
material contract of Parent, except for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, fees, rights, payments, cancellations or
accelerations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or such consents, waivers and
approvals which if not obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

         (d) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub
or any of its properties or assets except for such conflicts or violations
which, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

and the Transactions, Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred, directly or
indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         SECTION 6.01.     PREPARATION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC a Proxy Statement (the "PROXY STATEMENT") (it being understood
and agreed that both parties will use their reasonable best efforts to
accomplish this preparation and filing within three (3) weeks after the date
hereof). The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to respond to the
comments of the SEC in connection with the Proxy Statement and to furnish all
information required to prepare the Proxy Statement. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable following completion of any
SEC review. If necessary under applicable Law, after the definitive Proxy
Statement shall have been mailed, the Company shall promptly circulate amended,
supplemented or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection
therewith, re-solicit proxies. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.

         SECTION 6.02.     COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING. The Company shall, as

except as otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 6.04, use all reasonable best
efforts to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the

Stockholders' Approval; provided, however, the Company shall not be required to
retain the services of a proxy solicitor or utilize any Company employees, other
than the Company's chief executive officer, to solicit such proxies, and (iv)
consult with Parent with respect to each of the foregoing matters; provided,
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board of
Directors from failing to make or from withdrawing or modifying its
recommendation to the Company Stockholders hereunder if the Board of Directors
of the Company, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that such action is legally required for such Board of Directors to
comply with its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law.

         SECTION 6.03.     ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY; TRANSITION.

         (a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
shall: (i) provide to Parent (and its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal


                                       38


<PAGE>   43
counsel, agents and other representatives, collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES")
access at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice to the officers,
employees, agents, accountants (subject to execution of customary undertakings),
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and to the books and
records thereof, (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business,
properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the
Company as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request, (iii) deliver
to Parent or its Representative copies of all reports regularly prepared by the
Company or the Company's Representatives in the ordinary course of the Company's
business (other than reports filed with the SEC and publicly available) and such
other reports regarding the Company as Parent or its Representatives may
reasonably request, and (iv) cause its Representatives to meet regularly with
Parent upon the request of Parent at reasonable times and upon reasonable prior
notice to discuss the Company and the Company's business. No investigation will
affect any of the representations or warranties made herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         (b) The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 20, 2001 and the Confidentiality
Agreement dated November 30, 1999 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS"), each
between the Company and Parent, as applicable, other than the obligations set
forth in Sections 2 and 3 of the August 20, 2001 Confidentiality Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreements shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Effective Time.

         (c) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall work together to prepare for and facilitate a smooth
transition in anticipation of the consummation of the Transaction including, but
not limited to, using reasonable best efforts to put in place a six month
extension of that certain Warehouse Distribution Agreement by and between the
Company and Alpharma dated December 29, 2000, hold periodic meetings with
Company sales representatives and hold periodic meetings with Company sales
management personnel.

         SECTION 6.04.     NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS.

         (a) The Company agrees that (i) it and its officers, directors and
employees shall not and (ii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that
its agents and representatives shall not, (A) directly or indirectly, initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries relating to or the
making of any Acquisition Proposal or (B) directly or indirectly, continue,
enter into or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning any
Acquisition Proposal with or furnish any information relating to the Company or
provide access to the properties, books and records or any confidential
information or data of the Company to, any person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) prior to the Company
Stockholders' Approval being obtained, providing access to properties, books and
records and providing information or data in response to a request therefor by a
person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the
Board of Directors of the Company receives from the person so requesting such




                                       39


<PAGE>   44
information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar
to those contained in the August 20, 2001 Confidentiality Agreement (except for
(x) such changes specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement and (y) the provisions of
Sections 2 and 3 of such Confidentiality Agreement) (provided that all such
written information that has not previously been supplied to Parent is also
provided on a prior or substantially concurrent basis to Parent), or (iii) prior
to the Company Stockholders' Approval being obtained, engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal; if and only to the extent that in connection
with the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), (1) the Company's Board of Directors
(after consultation with its independent legal counsel) determines in good faith
that such action is legally required for the Board of Directors to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, (2)
such Acquisition Proposal is not subject to any financing contingencies or is,
in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of Directors (after
consultation with its financial advisor), reasonably capable of being financed
by such other person and (3) the Company's Board of Directors determines in good
faith after consultation with its independent legal counsel and financial
advisor (taking into account among other things the legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal, the person making the proposal, the
likelihood of consummation and the time to complete such transaction) that such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a transaction that is
reasonably capable of being completed and that, if consummated, would reasonably
be expected to result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
Stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to
in this Agreement as a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"). The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
any such person (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company
to return or destroy all such information. The Company shall also notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any indication of interest in making an Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof, which notice shall include the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal or indication and the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal or indication (including any subsequent material
amendment or modification to such terms and conditions). The Company shall keep
Parent promptly informed in all material respects of the status and details of
any such Acquisition Proposal.

         (b) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) except as
permitted by the proviso of SECTION 6.02, withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent) or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Board of Directors of the Company of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend,
or propose publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acquisition Proposal made by Parent), (ii) adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acquisition Proposal made by Parent), (iii) cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar agreement
which relates to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
(other




                                       40

<PAGE>   45

than a confidentiality agreement referred to in SECTION 6.04(a)) or (iv) agree
or resolve to take any of the actions prohibited by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
of this sentence. Notwithstanding anything in this SECTION 6.04 to the contrary,
if, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder's Approval being obtained, the
Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and independent legal counsel, in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from
a material breach of this SECTION 6.04, that such proposal is a Superior
Proposal, the Company or its Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to SECTION 8.01(e) and prior to such termination, may take such actions
as it reasonably determines to be necessary to satisfy the pre-conditions to
termination specified in SECTION 8.01(e).

         (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means any
proposal or offer with respect to (i) any tender offer or exchange offer, (ii)
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of
substantially all of the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving assets which, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets or earning
power of the Company, (iii) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of
more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company, (iv) any acquisition or
purchase, direct or indirect, that, if consummated, would result in any person
beneficially owning securities constituting more than 25% of any class or series
of equity or voting securities of the Company or (v) the sale or license of any
Intellectual Property rights related to the Pediatric Products (other than
licenses in the ordinary course in connection with sales), in each case, other
than the Merger.

         SECTION 6.05.     EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS. The Surviving Corporation
shall take all reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to permit the
employees who as of the Effective Time were employed by the Company and who
continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
(the "RETAINED EMPLOYEES") to continue to participate from and after the
Effective Time in the Company Benefit Plans in which such Retained Employees
were participating immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Surviving Corporation may permit any such employee benefit plan
or arrangement to be terminated or discontinued on or after the Effective Time,
provided that the Surviving Corporation shall (a) take all reasonable actions
necessary or appropriate to permit the Retained Employees participating in such
employee benefit plan or arrangement to immediately thereafter participate in
employee benefit plans or arrangements substantially comparable to those
maintained with respect to other Surviving Corporation employees (the
"REPLACEMENT PLANS"), (b) with respect to a Replacement Plan that is a group
health plan (i) credit such Retained Employees, for the year during which
participation in the Replacement Plan begins, with any deductibles and
copayments already incurred during such year under the terminated or
discontinued group health plan and (ii) waive any preexisting condition
limitations applicable to the Retained Employees (and their eligible dependents)
under the Replacement Plan to the extent that a Retained Employee's (or
dependent's) condition would not have caused a preexisting condition exclusion
under the terminated or discontinued group health plan, and (c)(1) cause each
Replacement Plan that is an employee pension benefit plan (as such term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) intended to be qualified under Section 401 of
the Code to be amended to provide that the Retained Employees shall receive
credit for participation and vesting purposes under such plan for their period
of employment with the Company and its predecessors to the extent such
predecessor employment was recognized by the Company and


                                       41

<PAGE>   46
(2) credit the Retained Employees under each other Replacement Plan that is not
described in the preceding clause for their period of employment with the
Company and its predecessors to the extent such predecessor employment was
recognized by the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, neither the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, nor any
employee, on the other hand, shall be obligated to continue any employment
relationship or any specific terms of employment for any specific period of
time. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit or restrict Parent's right
on or after the Effective Time to amend, modify or terminate any of the Company
Benefit Plans.

         SECTION 6.06.     FURTHER ACTION; CONSENTS; FILINGS. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, (ii) obtain from Governmental Authorities any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or
made by Parent or the Company or any of their subsidiaries in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions and (iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions required under applicable law. The parties hereto shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings necessary to consummate the Transactions, and shall
provide copies of all such documents to the nonfiling party and its legal
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith.

         SECTION 6.07.     PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial public disclosure
(the "INITIAL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE") relating to this Agreement shall be a press
release, the text of which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, until the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by applicable
law, neither party hereto shall issue any press release or otherwise make any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto except that either party may
make public statements between the date of the Initial Public Disclosure and the
Closing Date solely to the extent that the content of such public statements is

provisions of SECTIONS 6.03(b), 6.07, 10.03, 10.08, 10.11 and 10.12, provided

breaches hereof that shall have occurred prior to termination.

         (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to SECTION

pursuant to SECTIONS 8.01(d), 8.01(e) or 8.01(f) other than with respect to
liabilities arising out of or attributable to the willful breach by the Company

without the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly agreed that the
Person(s) to whom SECTIONS 6.09, 6.10, 6.11 and 6.13 apply shall be third party
beneficiaries of SECTIONS 6.09, 6.10, 6.11 and 6.13, each of whom may enforce
the provisions of SECTIONS 6.09, 6.10, 6.11 and 6.13).

         SECTION 9.02.     RIGHT OF SETOFF AGAINST THE CONTINGENT PAYMENTS.

         (a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall have the right to setoff
against any future Contingent Payments any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'




                                       51


<PAGE>   56
and consultants' fees and expenses and other reasonable costs of defending,
investigating or settling claims) (hereinafter, a "LOSS"), actually suffered or
incurred by Parent or its affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation), officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "PARENT AFFILIATED Parties") arising out of or
resulting from one or more bona fide claims by third parties ("THIRD PARTY
CLAIMS") made against a Parent Affiliated Party prior to the date that is two
(2) years after the Effective Time (the "EXPIRATION TIME"), but not if made
thereafter, to the extent such claims arise out of:

         (i) Section 9.02 Liabilities (as defined in SECTION 10.02(a) below) of
      the Company as of the date of the Balance Sheet to the extent not fully
      reflected or reserved against on the Balance Sheet; or

         (ii) Section 9.02 Liabilities incurred subsequent to the date of the
      Balance Sheet, other than (with respect to this clause (ii) and not with
      respect to clause (iii)) Section 9.02 Liabilities incurred by the Company
      subsequent to the date of the Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of
      business which would have been reflected on or reserved against on the
      Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP and consistent with past practices
      had they been incurred and not satisfied on or prior to the date of the
      Balance Sheet; or

         (iii) Section 9.02 Liabilities which are contingent liabilities and
      which, in accordance with GAAP and consistent with past practices, the
      Company determines prior to the Effective Time are "probable" claims.

         All Losses under this SECTION 9.02(a) shall be determined net of all
insurance proceeds received or receivable. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Parent Affiliated Parties to, use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses
(which shall not include any obligation to expend any material funds).

         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the sole remedy of the Parent Affiliated Parties with respect to
Third Party Claims shall be the right of setoff pursuant to this SECTION 9.02,
and:

         (i) the maximum aggregate amount of Losses arising out of or resulting
      from Third Party Claims that may be setoff against the Contingent Payments
      shall be limited to $50,000,000 and the setoff against the Contingent
      Payments pursuant to SECTION 9.02(c) shall be the Parent Affiliated
      Parties' sole remedy to receive any payments pursuant to this SECTION
      9.02; and

         (ii) no Losses with respect to any Third Party Claims shall be setoff
      against the Contingent Payments until such time as the aggregate amounts
      of all such Losses shall equal or exceed $250,000 (the "DEDUCTIBLE"), and
      then only with respect to the excess thereof over $250,000.

         (c) Any Loss of any Parent Affiliated Party pursuant to this SECTION
9.02 may only be satisfied by setoff against any Contingent Payment which may
become payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to SECTION 2.03 on or after
the date of the setoff (except, as to a particular claimed Loss, to the extent
of amounts withheld as to such Loss in accordance with the



                                       52

<PAGE>   57
following sentence) including, without limitation, any Contingent Payments to be
paid or earned after the Expiration Time so long as the Third Party Claim with
respect to such Loss was made prior to the Expiration Time. In the event that
Parent claims a setoff is due pursuant to SECTION 9.02(a), Parent may withhold a
portion of a Contingent Payment that is otherwise due pursuant to SECTION 2.03
until the dispute with respect to the Loss is resolved; provided, however, that
in no event shall Parent withhold a portion of the Contingent Payment in excess
of the amount of the Loss in dispute. In the event that, upon resolution of such
dispute in accordance with SECTION 9.03, Parent is deemed to have incorrectly
withheld a portion of a Contingent Payment, Parent shall promptly pay such
incorrectly withheld portion to the Paying Agent in cash, together with interest
on such portion calculated from the date such withheld portion should have been
paid and calculated at the lesser of (i) five percent (5%) per annum, compounded
annually, or (ii) the highest rate permitted by Law. The failure to withhold a
sufficient portion of a Contingent Payment with respect to Losses shall not
limit or restrict the right of any Parent Affiliated Party to setoff such Losses
against one or more future Contingent Payments.

         SECTION 9.03.     PROCEDURE FOR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

         (a) The obligations and liabilities with respect to Losses arising from
Third Party Claims under this Article IX shall be governed by and contingent
upon the following additional terms and conditions: (i) no claim may be asserted
or setoff made related to any Third Party Claim unless written notice of such
Third Party Claim is received by the Calculation Representative prior to the end
of the Expiration Time; and (ii) if the Parent Affiliated Party shall receive
notice of any Third Party Claim, Parent shall give the Calculation
Representative notice of such Third Party Claim promptly following the receipt
by the Parent Affiliated Party of such notice; provided, however, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not affect or reduce the Parent's right to
setoff, except to the extent that the amount of setoff is increased by such
failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances known to the Parent Affiliated Party that gave rise to such Third
Party Claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising
therefrom.

         (b) If the Calculation Representative acknowledges in writing the
Parent's right to setoff against the Contingent Payments any Losses that may
result from such Third Party Claim, then the Calculation Representative shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to
do so to the Parent within 15 days of the receipt of such notice from the Parent
(and, to the extent the Calculation Representative defends such Third Party
Claim, the costs and expenses of counsel for the Parent Affiliated Parties shall
not constitute Losses); provided, however, that, if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Parent Affiliated Party, based
on the advice of Parent's counsel, for the same counsel to represent both the
Parent Affiliated Party and the Calculation Representative, then the Parent
Affiliated Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each
jurisdiction for which counsel is required, and Parent may setoff such expenses
against any future Contingent Payments to the extent otherwise provided herein;
provided that the Parent Affiliated Parties shall not be entitled to select more
than one counsel in any jurisdiction. In the event that the Calculation
Representative exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any
such Third Party Claim as provided above, each Parent Affiliated Party shall
cooperate with the Calculation Representative in such defense and make




                                       53


<PAGE>   58
available to the Calculation Representative, at such Parent Affiliated Party's
expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such
Parent Affiliated Party's possession or under such Parent Affiliated Party's
control relating thereto as are reasonably required by the Calculation
Representative. Similarly, in the event such Parent Affiliated Party is,
directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party
Claim, the Calculation Representative shall cooperate with the Parent Affiliated
Party in such defense and make available to the Parent Affiliated Party, all
such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Calculation
Representative's possession or under the Calculation Representative's control
relating thereto as are reasonably required by the Parent Affiliated Party. No
such Third Party Claim may be settled by Calculation Representative without the
prior written consent of the Parent unless the Parent Affiliated Parties are
released in full in connection with such settlement. A Parent Affiliated Party
may settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Calculation
Representative; provided, however, that the Parent Affiliated Party may not
setoff such settled Third Party Claim against any Contingent Payment, any future
Contingent Payment or amounts withheld from Contingent Payments pursuant to
SECTION 9.02(c) unless the Calculation Representative consented to such
settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent notifies the Calculation
Representative in writing of its desire to settle a Third Party Claim and the
Calculation Representative does not within 10 Business Days of such notice
consent to such settlement, then Parent may at any time or from time to time
setoff against any Contingent Payment, any future Contingent Payments and any
amounts withheld from Contingent Payments pursuant to SECTION 9.02(c) relating
to such claim, any and all reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and
expenses and other reasonable costs of defending, investigating or settling such
claims (collectively, the "DEFENSE COSTS") with respect to such Third Party
Claim, whether incurred before or after such notification; provided, however, if
Parent does not settle such Third Party Claim and as a result of a final,
non-appealable judgment, no Parent Affiliated Party is liable to any party or
parties with respect to such Third Party Claim then in such case, Parent shall
not be entitled to setoff the Defense Costs with respect to such Third Party
Claim and shall reimburse any Defense Costs previously setoff with respect to
such Third Party Claim.

         SECTION 9.04.     CALCULATION REPRESENTATIVE. FS Private Investments,
LLC ("FS PRIVATE") or any affiliate of FS Private as FS Private shall designate
(the "FS DESIGNEE"), ("FS Private or the FS Designee, as the case may be, being
referred to herein as "CALCULATION REPRESENTATIVE"), shall have full authority
to act and to take any and all actions required or permitted to be taken under
this Agreement, with respect to any claims (including the settlement thereof)
made by one or more Parent Affiliated Parties for setoff pursuant to this
Article IX or any dispute, claim or controversy under SECTION 2.03(d). In the
event that FS Private, the FS Designee or any subsequent Calculation
Representative resigns as Calculation Representative or is no longer able to
perform such duties, Emmett Clemente, or if he is unable or unwilling to serve,
a Person (selected by an arbitrator listed on the Panel List) who is willing to
serve in such capacity, shall be the Calculation Representative; provided that
if the FS Designee resigns, FS Private shall again have the right to designate
an affiliate as Calculation Representative. Neither the Calculation
Representative nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be
liable to any Person for any error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken, under this Agreement, except in the case of its gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Calculation Representative may
consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or


                                       54

<PAGE>   59

omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
counsel, accountants or experts. The Calculation Representative shall not have
any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any
of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement. As to any matters not
expressly provided for in this Agreement, the Calculation Representative shall
not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action. The Parent
Affiliated Parties shall be entitled to rely on all statements, representations
and decisions of the Calculation Representative. Any out-of-pocket costs or
expenses incurred by the Calculation Representative in performing its duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement, and not paid by Parent or otherwise
reimbursed to the Calculation Representative as provided in this Agreement,
shall be (x) deducted from any unpaid Contingent Payments, if any, and paid by
Parent to the Calculation Representative solely from such future Contingent
Payments, if any, and (y) treated as Contingent Payment Adjustments; provided,
however, the Calculation Representative's rights under this sentence are
subordinated to Parent's prior right of setoff as to any unpaid amounts to which
Parent has made a claim under Article IX.
