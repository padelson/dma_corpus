 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND AMALGAMATION (this "Agreement"), dated as of August 5, 2008, is by and among Arlington Tankers Ltd., a company incorporated in the Islands of Bermuda ("Archer"), Galileo Holding Corporation, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands ("New Parent"), Archer Amalgamation Limited, a company incorporated in the Islands of Bermuda and a wholly owned Subsidiary of New Parent ("Amalgamation Sub"), Galileo Merger Corporation, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and a wholly owned Subsidiary of New Parent ("Merger Sub"), and General Maritime Corporation, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands ("Galileo"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Archer (the "Archer Board"), the Board of Directors of Galileo (the "Galileo Board"), and the Boards of Directors of New Parent, Amalgamation Sub and Merger Sub each deem it advisable to and in the best interests of each respective company and its shareholders that Archer and Galileo combine on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement in order to advance the long-term business interests of Archer and Galileo; 

  

 WHEREAS, the combination of Archer and Galileo shall be effected as follows: (i) Archer will amalgamate with Amalgamation Sub, with the resulting amalgamated company continuing as the surviving entity (the "Archer Amalgamation"), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Bermuda Companies Act 1981 (the "Companies Act"), and (ii) the Merger Sub will merge with and into Galileo with Galileo continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Galileo Merger" and, together with the Archer Amalgamation, the "Combinations"), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Business Corporations Act of the Marshall Islands (the "BCA"); 

  

 WHEREAS, upon consummation of the Combinations, each of the Amalgamated Company and the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned Subsidiary of New Parent, which has been formed by Archer and Galileo solely for the purpose of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that each of the Archer Amalgamation and the Galileo Merger, together with the transactions set forth in Section 6.19, shall qualify as reorganizations within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, Archer, Galileo, Merger Sub, Amalgamation Sub and New Parent agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I

---|---|---|---

 (a) Archer and Galileo have caused New Parent to be organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Archer owns 27% of the capital stock of New Parent and Galileo owns 73% of the capital stock of New Parent. The authorized capital stock of New Parent consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "New Parent Common Stock"), of which 27 shares have been issued to Archer and 73 shares have been issued to Galileo. Archer and Galileo shall each take, and shall each cause New Parent to take, all requisite action to cause (i) the Articles of Incorporation of New Parent to be in the form of _Exhibit A_, or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto and provided in an amendment to this Agreement (which amendment shall include, among other things, an amendment of such _Exhibit A_), and providing, among other things, that the name of New Parent shall be "General Maritime Corporation," and, as so amended, such Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation of New Parent, until further amended in accordance with the BCA, and (ii) the By-laws of New Parent to be in the form of _Exhibit B_, or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto and provided in an amendment to this Agreement (which amendment shall include, among other things, an amendment of such _Exhibit B_), and, as so amended, such By-laws shall be the By-laws of New Parent, until further amended in accordance with the BCA. 

  

 (b) The sole director of New Parent as of the date hereof is the individual listed on  _Schedule 1.1(b)(i)_.

If any of the individuals listed on  _Schedule 1.1(b)(ii)_ shall prior to the Effective Time be unable or unwilling to hold office as a director of New Parent immediately after the Effective Time, the Galileo Board shall designate another individual to be appointed director in his or her place, and such individual shall become a director of New Parent at the Effective Time. Neither Archer nor Galileo nor New Parent shall permit any individual to be a director of New Parent other than in accordance with this Section 1.1(b). 

  

 (c) Archer and Galileo have caused New Parent to organize, and New Parent has organized, Amalgamation Sub under the laws of the Islands of Bermuda and Merger Sub under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The authorized share capital of Amalgamation Sub consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Amalgamation Sub Common Stock"), all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned by New Parent. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"), all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned by New Parent.

the relevant provisions of the BCA and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the BCA in order to effect the Galileo Merger.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean the time when the Galileo Merger and the Archer Amalgamation become effective.

 1.4 _Effects of the Combinations_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time (i) the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Galileo, with Galileo continuing as the surviving corporation and a Marshall Islands company and having such name as Galileo may determine (Galileo following the Galileo Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and (ii) the Articles of Incorporation of Galileo shall be amended to read in the form of _Exhibit C_ , and, as so amended, such Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the BCA. In addition, Archer and Galileo shall cause New Parent to cause the Bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time to be amended and restated at the Effective Time in the form of  _Exhibit D_, and, as so amended and restated, such Bylaws shall

 _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_   

  

 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

All shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Galileo ("Galileo Common Stock") that are owned by Galileo as treasury stock or by any Subsidiary of Galileo, any shares of Galileo Common Stock owned by Archer or any Subsidiary of Archer, and any shares of Galileo Common Stock owned by New Parent, Merger Sub or Amalgamation Sub, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of New Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (iii) _Exchange Ratio for Galileo Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Galileo Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) and Galileo Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 1.34 (the "Galileo Exchange Ratio") shares of New Parent Common Stock upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Galileo Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Galileo Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Galileo Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of New Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iii) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of New Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest. 

  

 (iv) _Unvested Stock_. At the Effective Time, any shares of New Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(iii) with respect to any unvested shares of Galileo Common Stock awarded to employees, directors or consultants pursuant to any of Galileos plans or arrangements and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and vesting schedule as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent by their terms such unvested shares of Galileo Common Stock vest at the Effective Time. Galileo shall not take or permit any action which would accelerate vesting of any unvested shares, except to the extent required by their terms as in effect on the date hereof. Copies of the relevant agreements governing such shares and the vesting thereof have been provided to Archer. All outstanding rights which Galileo may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Galileo Common Stock shall be assigned to New Parent as of the Effective Time and shall thereafter be exercisable by New Parent upon the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the shares purchasable pursuant to such rights and the purchase price payable per share shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the Galileo Exchange Ratio. Galileo shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1(a)(iv) to occur. 

  

 (b) _Archer Amalgamation_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Archer Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of Archer or the capital stock of the Amalgamation Sub:

As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Archer Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Archer Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of New Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(iii) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of New Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest. 

  

 (c) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. If there is any reclassification, stock split, subdivision, reverse split, consolidation, stock or share dividend or bonus issue (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Galileo Exchange Ratio and the Archer Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Galileo Common Stock and Archer Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 (d) _Effect on New Parent Common Stock_. Immediately following the Effective Time, shares of the capital stock of New Parent owned by the Surviving Corporation or the Amalgamated Company shall be cancelled by New Parent without payment therefor. 

  

 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Archer Common Stock and Galileo Common Stock for New Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Archer Amalgamation and the Galileo Merger, respectively, are as follows: 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Promptly following the Effective Time, New Parent shall enter into an exchange agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Archer, with The Bank of New York Mellon or another bank or trust company designated by Galileo and reasonably acceptable to Archer (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Archer Common Stock and Galileo Common Stock, which shall provide for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, of (i) certificates 

   ##### 

  

    

representing the shares of New Parent Common Stock (such shares of New Parent
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Archer Common Stock and Galileo Common
Stock, (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments for fractional
shares required pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and (iii) any dividends or
distributions to which holders of certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Archer Common Stock or
Galileo Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted
pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive shares of New Parent Common
Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the shares of New Parent Common
Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) out
of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.2(f), the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Galileo shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were converted into the right to receive New Parent Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Galileo may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of New Parent Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of New Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of New Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Archer or Galileo, respectively, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of New Parent Common Stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d) may be issued or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of New Parent Common Stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

  

 (c) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of New Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, 

   ##### 

  

    

and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of New Parent. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Archer Common
Stock or Galileo Common Stock converted pursuant to the Archer Amalgamation
or the Galileo Merger, respectively, who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of New Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of
shares of Archer Common Stock and Galileo Common Stock collectively
represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest)
in an amount (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to such fractional part of
a share of New Parent Common Stock multiplied by the closing price of New
Parent Common Stock at the end of regular trading hours on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") on the first trading day following the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, as such price is reported on the NYSE Composite
Transaction Tape (as reported by _Bloomberg Financial Markets_ or such other
source as the parties shall agree in writing). 

  

 (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to New Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the record holder of such Certificate (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of New Parent Common Stock, without interest, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions having a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender that are payable with respect to such whole shares of New Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Archer Common Stock and Galileo Common Stock_. All shares of New Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock represented by such Certificates, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation or the Amalgamated Company of the shares of Galileo Common Stock or Archer Common Stock, respectively, which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Archer Common Stock and Galileo Common Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to New Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to New Parent for, and New Parent shall remain liable for, payment of its claim for New Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of New Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to New Parent Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of Archer, Amalgamation Sub, Merger Sub, Galileo, New Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Amalgamated Company, or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of New Parent Common Stock, Galileo Common Stock or Archer Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to four years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of New Parent Common Stock, and any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares of New Parent Common Stock or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of New Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of New Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Amalgamated Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by New Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by New Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as New Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, New Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of New Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of New Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (j) _Uncertificated Shares_. In the case of outstanding shares of Archer Common Stock or Galileo Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties shall make such adjustments to the procedures described in this Section 2.2 as are necessary or appropriate to implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.2 has with respect to shares of Archer Common Stock and Galileo Common Stock that are represented by Certificates. 

  

 (k) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund in investment-grade securities, as directed by New Parent, on a daily basis;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former shareholders of Archer or Galileo after the Effective Time pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall become part of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant
to this Article II shall be paid to New Parent. 

  

 2.3 _Galileo Stock Plans_.

Such Galileo Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions to which they are currently subject (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Galileo Merger).

 (ii) If any Archer Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through the applicable holders withdrawal of an appraisal application to the applicable Bermuda court or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive shares of New Parent Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of New Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions) in accordance with Section 2.1(b), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares. 

  

 (iii) Archer shall give Galileo: (A) prompt notice of any demands received by Archer for payment or appraisal of shares of Archer Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to Archer prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Companies Act that relate to such demand; and (B) the

   ##### 

  

    

disproportionate effect on Galileo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
relative to Archer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in which case the
incremental disproportionate impact(s) may be deemed either alone or in
combination to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been, or is reasonably likely to be, a Galileo Material Adverse
Effect), (B) changes, events, circumstances or developments occurring after
the date hereof, affecting the industries in which Archer and Galileo operate
generally (except to the extent those changes or events have a materially

may be deemed either alone or in combination to constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been, or is reasonably likely to be,
a Galileo Material Adverse Effect), (E) the announcement and pendency of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) any outbreak of
major hostilities in which the United States is involved or any act of
terrorism within the United States or directed against its facilities
or citizens wherever located; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall a change in the trading prices or volume of Galileos capital stock, by
itself, be considered a "Galileo Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties agree that the terms "material," "materially" or
"materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall
have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the
meanings ascribed to Galileo Material Adverse Effect in the prior sentence of

and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such person and its
Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a)(i) or the taking of any actions
inconsistent with the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a)(i) by any
Representative or Subsidiary of Archer, whether or not such Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of Archer or otherwise, shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 6.1(a)(i) by Archer. 

   

 (ii) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Neither the Archer Board nor any committee thereof shall: 

  

 (A) except as permitted by this Section 6.1(a), withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Galileo, or publicly (or in a manner designed to become public) propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Galileo, its approval or recommendation with respect to the Archer Voting Proposal; 

  

 (B) cause or permit Archer to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger

into in the circumstances referred to in, and as permitted pursuant to,

 (C) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to compliance with Section
6.1(a)(iii), the Archer Board may withdraw or modify its recommendation with
respect to the Archer Voting Proposal if the Archer Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that its
fiduciary obligations require it to do so, but only at a time that is prior
to the Specified Archer Time and is following receipt by Galileo of written
notice advising Galileo that the Archer Board desires to withdraw or modify
the recommendation and, if such withdrawal is due to the existence of
an Acquisition Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and identifying the person making such Acquisition
Proposal. Nothing in this Section 6.1(a) shall be deemed to (1) permit Archer
to take any action described in clauses (B) or (C) of the first sentence of
this Section 6.1(a)(ii), (2) affect any obligation of Archer under this
Agreement or (3) limit Archers obligation to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Archer Meeting, regardless of whether or not the Archer Board
has withdrawn or modified its recommendation.

Archer shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to, provide any information to or participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or entity making any Acquisition Proposal or any such request or inquiry until five business days after Archer has first notified Galileo of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry as required by the preceding sentence. If Archer receives any Acquisition Proposal or any such request or inquiry, it shall (A) keep Galileo fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and details (including any change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (B) provide to Galileo as promptly as possible after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Archer from any third party in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry or sent or provided by Archer to any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and (C) if Galileo shall make a counterproposal, consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf in good faith with respect to the terms of such counterproposal. 

  

 (iv) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.1(a) or in Section 6.5 shall be deemed to prohibit Archer from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good faith judgment of the Archer Board, after consultation 

   ##### 

  

    

with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable law. 

  

 (v) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. Archer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations with any person regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, an Acquisition Proposal.

 (B) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information with respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any person with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with respect to, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, any Change of Control Proposal. 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval of the Galileo Voting
Proposal at the Galileo Meeting (the "Specified Galileo Time"), Galileo may,
to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Galileo Board, as
determined in good faith by the Galileo Board after consultation with outside
counsel, in response to a Change of Control Proposal that did not result from
a breach by Galileo of this Section 6.1(b), and subject to compliance with
Section 6.1(b)(iii), (x) furnish information with respect to Galileo to the
person making such Change of Control Proposal and its Representatives
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding
such Change of Control Proposal. 

  

Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(b)(i) or the taking of any actions
inconsistent with the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(b)(i) by any
Representative or Subsidiary of Galileo, whether or not such Representative
is purporting to act on behalf of Galileo or otherwise, shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 6.1(b)(i) by Galileo.

 (B) cause or permit Galileo to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating to any Change of Control Proposal that is not a Permitted Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(b)(i) entered into in the circumstances referred to in, and as permitted pursuant to, Section 6.1(b)(i)) (a "Galileo Acquisition Agreement"); or 

  

 (C) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Galileo Acquisition Agreement; or 

  

 (D) cause or permit Galileo to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(l) in connection with entering into a Galileo Acquisition Agreement, 

 

unless the Galileo Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that its fiduciary obligations require it to cause Galileo
to act as provided in this Section 6.1(b)(ii), in which case it may so act. 

   

 (iii) _Notices_. Galileo shall as promptly as possible advise Archer orally, with written confirmation to follow promptly (and in any event within 24 hours), of any Change of Control Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with any Change of Control Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Change of Control Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Change of Control Proposal, request or inquiry and the identity of the person making any such Change of Control Proposal, request or inquiry.

Nothing contained in this Section 6.1(b) or in Section 6.5 shall be deemed to prohibit Galileo from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good faith judgment of the Galileo Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law. 

  

 (v) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. Galileo shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all

   ##### 

  

    

shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Manager to maintain
insurance at the levels reasonably requested by Galileo in the course of such
consultation. If, in the course of the exercise by Archer of such reasonable
best efforts, Galileo reasonably determines that any Manager is not
implementing on a reasonably prompt basis insurance at the levels
reasonably requested by Galileo, then Archer shall, at Galileos instruction,
purchase directly such insurance for the Archer Vessels as Galileo may
reasonably request, to the extent such insurance is available in the market

 (f) The expenses and fees, if applicable, payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), 8.3(c), 8.3(d) and 8.3(e) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds within one business day after demand therefor following the first to occur of the events giving rise to the payment obligation described therein; _provided_ , that in no event shall Archer or Galileo, as the case may be, be required to pay the expenses and fees, if applicable, to the other, if, immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement, the party to receive the expenses and fees, if applicable, was in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement. If one party fails to promptly pay to the other any expense reimbursement or fee due hereunder, the defaulting party shall pay the costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. plus five percent per annum, compounded quarterly, from the date such expense reimbursement or fee was required to be paid. 

  

 (g) Payment of any termination fee described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this Agreement described in clause (i) of Section 8.2. 

  

 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Combinations by the shareholders of any of the parties, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended after the Effective Time. Except as required by law, no amendment of this Agreement shall require the approval of the shareholders of either party. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, and subject to Section 8.4, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the

representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall
not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition,
as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or
waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Galileo Disclosure Letter and the Archer Disclosure Letter and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior agreements by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.12, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.

Any purported assignment of rights or delegation of performance obligations in violation of this Section 9.5 is void. 

  

 9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any such term or provision is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will 

   ##### 

  

    

achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term. 

  

 9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission, "PDF" document or other electronic image scan. 

  

 9.8 _Interpretation_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (i) "either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include", "includes" and "including" are not limiting; (ii) "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (iii) "date hereof" refers to the date set forth in the initial caption of this Agreement; (iv) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if"; (v) descriptive headings, the table of defined terms and the table of contents are inserted for convenience only and do not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement; (vi) definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms; (vii) references to a person or entity are also to its permitted successors and assigns; (viii) references to an "Article", "Section", "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refer to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement; (ix) references to "$" or otherwise to dollar amounts refer to the lawful currency of the United States; (x) references to a federal, state, local or foreign statute or law include any rules, regulations and delegated legislation issued thereunder; (xi) references to a communication by a regulatory agency include a communication by the staff of such regulatory agency; and (xi) references to an " _agreement_ " to which a person or entity is bound means any contract, agreement, instrument, obligation, undertaking, lease, arrangement, commitment or understanding, whether written or oral, in each case that is legally binding on such person or entity and as it may be amended or otherwise modified from time to time. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party hereto. No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 9.9 _Governing Law_. All matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including its interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of New York, _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Galileo Merger will also be governed by the applicable provisions of the BCA to the extent required thereby and (ii) the Archer Amalgamation will also be governed by the applicable provisions of the Companies Act to the extent required thereby. 

  

 9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other 

   ##### 

  

    

remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. For the
avoidance of doubt, the availability to any party of a right of termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(i)(B) or 8.1(j)(B) shall not limit such partys right
to pursue an injunction or specific enforcement of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, nor shall it limit the availability of any other remedy
to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, but this sentence shall
not limit Section 8.2. 

  

 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in New York, New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. 

  

 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ARCHER, NEW PARENT, AMALGAMATION SUB, MERGER SUB OR GALILEO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 _Exhibit A_ 

   

Attached hereto.  

    ##### 

 

   

FORM OF 
 AMENDED AND RESTATED 
 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF 
 GENERAL MARITIME CORPORATION 

   

 FIRST: The name of the corporation shall be General Maritime Corporation. 

  

 SECOND: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful business purpose or purposes for which corporations may now or hereafter be organized under the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (the "BCA"). 

  

 THIRD: The registered address of the Corporation in the Marshall Islands is Trust Company Complex, Ajeltake Road, Ajeltake Island, Majuro, Marshall Islands MH96960. The name of the Corporations registered agent at such address is The Trust Company of the Marshall Islands, Inc. 

  

 FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is one hundred and fifty million (150,000,000), of which stock ten million (10,000,000) registered shares of the par value of one cent (US$.01) per share shall be preferred stock, and of which one hundred and forty million (140,000,000) registered shares of the par value of one cent (US$.01) per share shall be common stock. 

  

 The rights, preferences and limitations of said classes of stock are as follows: 

  

 1. The preferred stock may be issued from time to time by the Board of Directors as shares of one or more series of preferred stock, and the Board of Directors is expressly authorized, prior to issuance, in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of shares of each particular series, to fix the following: 

  

 (a) The distinctive serial designation of such series which shall distinguish it from other series; 

   

 (b) The number of shares included in such series, which number may be increased or decreased from time to time to the extent unissued, authorized shares of preferred stock remain available for such purpose, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in creating the series; 

   

 (c) The annual dividend or other rate (or method for determining such rate) for shares of such series and the date or dates upon which such dividends shall be payable; 

   

 (d) Whether dividends on the shares of such series shall be cumulative, and, in the case of shares of any series having cumulative dividend rights, the date or dates (or method for determining the date or dates) from which dividends on the shares of such series shall be cumulative; 

   

 (e) The amount or amounts (or the method for determining the amount or amounts) which shall be paid out of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the shares of 

    ##### 

  

    

such series upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation; 

   

 (f) The price or prices (or method for determining the price or prices) at which, the period or periods within which and the terms and conditions upon which the shares of such series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Corporation; 

   

 (g) The obligation, if any, of the Corporation to purchase or redeem shares of such series pursuant to a sinking fund or otherwise and the price or prices (or method for determining the price or prices) at which, the period or periods within which and the terms and conditions upon which the shares of such series shall be redeemed, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation; 

   

 (h) The period or periods within which and the terms and conditions, if any, including the price or prices or the rate or rates (or method for determining same) of conversion and the terms and conditions of any adjustments thereof, upon which the shares of such series shall be convertible at the option of the holder or the Corporation into shares of any class of stock or into shares of any other series of preferred stock; 

   

 (i) The voting rights, if any, of the shares of such series in addition to those required by law; 

   

 (j) The ranking of the shares of the series as compared with shares of other series of preferred stock in respect of the right to receive dividends and the right to receive payments out of the assets of the Corporation upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; and 

   

 (k) Any other relative rights, preferences or limitations of the shares of the series not inconsistent herewith or with applicable law. 

   

 2. No holder of common stock or of preferred stock shall be entitled as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase, or have any preemptive right with respect to, any part of any new or additional issue of stock of any class whatsoever, or of securities convertible into any stock of any class whatsoever, whether now or hereafter authorized and whether issued for cash or other consideration or by way of dividend, except as provided in the Certificate of Designation related to a given series of preferred stock or as fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article Fourth. 

  

 3\. Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in accordance with paragraph 1 above in respect of any series of preferred stock, all voting rights of the Corporation shall be vested exclusively in the holders of the common stock who shall be entitled to one vote per share and shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders meeting and to vote upon any such matters as provided in the by-laws of the Corporation or as may be provided by law. Except for and subject to those rights expressly granted to holders of preferred stock or except as may be provided by the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the holders of common stock shall have exclusively all other rights of shareholders, including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, out of assets lawfully available therefor, and (ii) in the event of any distribution or assets upon a 

   ##### 

  

 

liquidation or otherwise, the right to receive all the assets and funds of the
Corporation remaining after the payment to the holders of the preferred
stock, if any, of the specific amounts which they are entitled to receive
upon such distribution. 

   

 FIFTH: The Corporation is to have perpetual existence and shall have every power which a corporation now or hereafter organized under the BCA may have. 

  

 SIXTH: (a) From and after the date hereof, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as the then total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors permits, with the term of office of one or another of the three classes expiring each year. The Board of Directors shall by resolution initially divide the Board of Directors into three classes, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the term of office of the second class to expire at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the term of office of the third class to expire at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Commencing with the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the directors elected at an annual meeting of shareholders to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be identified as being directors of the same class as the directors whom they succeed, and each of them shall hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders and until such directors successor is elected and has qualified. Any vacancies in the Board of Directors for any reason, and any created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the vote of not less than 66 2/3% of the members of the Board of Directors then in office, although less than a quorum, and any directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such directors shall have been chosen and until their successors shall be elected and qualified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, the then authorized number of directors shall be increased by the number of directors so to be elected, and the terms of the director or directors elected by such holders shall expire at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation), any director or the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation may be removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) cast at a meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, the provisions of this Section (c) of this Article Sixth shall not apply with respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of preferred stock. 

   

 (c) Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the election. Cumulative voting, as defined in Division 7, Section 71(2) of the BCA, shall not be used to elect directors. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal this Article Sixth. 

   

 SEVENTH: The Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal by-laws of the Corporation by a vote of not less than a majority of the entire Board of Directors, and the shareholders may not make additional by-laws and may not alter or repeal any by-law, except where such power to amend or repeal is expressly granted by the BCA. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal this Article Seventh. 

  

 EIGHTH: (a) Except as provided in this Article Eighth, special meetings of the shareholders may be called exclusively by the Board of Directors, who shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed special meeting. If there is a failure to hold the annual meeting within a period of ninety (90) days after the date designated therefor, or if no date has been designated for a period of thirteen (13) months after the organization of the Corporation or after its last annual meeting, holders of not less than 10% of the shares entitled to vote in an election of directors may, in writing, demand the call of a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting specifying the time thereof, which shall not be less than two (2) nor more than three (3) months from the date of such call. The Secretary of the Corporation upon receiving the written demand shall promptly give notice of such meeting, or if the secretary fails to do so within five (5) business days thereafter, any shareholder signing such demand may give such notice. Such notice shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed special meeting. The business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated when the meeting is called by the Board of Directors or in the notice of such meeting. 

  

 (b) Any action required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal this Article Eighth. 

    ##### 

  

     

 NINTH: (a) The Corporation may not engage in any Business Combination with any Interested Shareholder for a period of three years following the time of the transaction in which the person became an Interested Shareholder, unless: 

  

 (1) prior to such time, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved either the Business Combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder; 

  

 (2) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder, the Interested Shareholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned (i) by persons who are directors and also officers and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or 

  

 (3) at or subsequent to such time, the Business Combination is approved by the Board of Directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the Interested Shareholder; or 

  

 (4) the shareholder is Peter C. Georgiopoulos or an affiliate or associate thereof. 

  

 (b) The restrictions contained in this section shall not apply if: 

   

 (1) A shareholder becomes an Interested Shareholder inadvertently and (i) as soon as practicable divests itself of ownership of sufficient shares so that the shareholder ceases to be an Interested Shareholder; and (ii) would not, at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to a Business Combination between the Corporation and such shareholder, have been an Interested Shareholder but for the inadvertent acquisition of ownership; or 

  

 (2) The Business Combination is proposed prior to the consummation or abandonment of and subsequent to the earlier of the public announcement or the notice required hereunder of a proposed transaction which (i) constitutes one of the transactions described in the following sentence; (ii) is with or by a person who either was not an Interested Shareholder during the previous three years or who became an Interested Shareholder with the approval of the Board; and (iii) is approved or not opposed by a majority of the members of the Board then in office (but not less than one) who were Directors prior to any person becoming an Interested Shareholder during the previous three years or were recommended for election or elected to succeed such Directors by a majority of such Directors. 

  

 The proposed transactions referred to in the preceding sentence are limited to: 

   

 (I) a merger or consolidation of the Corporation (except for a merger in respect of which, pursuant to the BCA, no vote of the shareholders of the Corporation is required); 

    ##### 

  

     

 (II) a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions), whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of assets of the Corporation or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation (other than to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary or to the Corporation) having an aggregate market value equal to 50% or more of either that aggregate market value of all of the assets of the Corporation determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the outstanding shares of the Corporation; or 

   

 (III) a proposed tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding voting shares of the Corporation. 

   

 The Corporation shall give not less than 20 days notice to all Interested Shareholders prior to the consummation of any of the transactions described in clause (I) or (II) of the second sentence of this paragraph.

action taken solely by the Corporation; provided that such person shall be an
Interested Shareholder if thereafter such person acquires additional shares
of voting shares of the Corporation, except as a result of further Company
action not caused, directly or indirectly, by such person. For the purpose of
determining whether a person is an Interested Shareholder, the voting shares

 (iii) Has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or consent as described in item (B) of subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph), or disposing of such shares with any other person that beneficially owns, or whose affiliates or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, such shares. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by law, these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation), the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal this Article Ninth.

If the BCA hereafter is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors for actions taken or omitted to be taken then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended BCA in respect of actions or omissions to act which occurred during any period to which the BCAs amended provisions pertain. Any repeal or modification of this Article Tenth by the shareholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of the director existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

SHAREHOLDERS  

  

 Section 1.1 ANNUAL MEETINGS. An annual meeting of shareholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place either within or without the Marshall Islands as may be designated by the Board of Directors from time to time or as may be otherwise required by the articles of incorporation. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting. 

  

 Section 1.2 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of shareholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, to be held at such date, time and place either within or without the Marshall Islands as may be stated in the notice of the meeting or as may be otherwise required by the articles of incorporation. The business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. 

  

 Section 1.3 NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Whenever shareholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than fifteen nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to the shareholder at such shareholders address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.4 ADJOURNMENTS. Any meeting of shareholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the meeting is adjourned for lack of quorum, notice of the new meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after an adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record on the new record date entitled to notice under Section 1.3 of these By-laws. 

  

 Section 1.5 QUORUM. At each meeting of shareholders, except where otherwise provided by law or the articles of incorporation or these By-laws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the shareholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided by Section 1.4 of these By-laws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own capital stock belonging on the record date for the meeting to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the 

   ##### 

  

    

shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation
is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be
entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock,
including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary
capacity. 

  

 Section 1.6 ORGANIZATION. Meetings of shareholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board by the President, or in the absence of the President by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 

  

 Section 1.7 VOTING; PROXIES. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, each shareholder entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such shareholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in the law of the Marshall Islands to support an irrevocable power. A shareholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of shareholders need not be by written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. At all meetings of shareholders for the election of directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. With respect to other matters, unless otherwise provided by law or by the articles of incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of all classes of stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders. Where a separate vote by class is required, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of each class present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class, except as otherwise provided by law or by the articles of incorporation or these By-laws. 

  

 Section 1.8 NOTICE OF NOMINATION. Nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors. Nominations by other than action of the Board of Directors shall be made by notice in proper written form pursuant to Section 1.12 hereof, delivered or mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding years annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than thirty (30) days from such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder will be considered timely if it is delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual

meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the
date of such meeting is first made. Notice of nominations which are proposed

In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payments of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than fifteen days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is first given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (2) the record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the
tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such
meeting is first made. 

  

 (d) No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.12 hereof, except that once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 1.11 or Section 1.12 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. 

  

 Section 1.12 PROPER WRITTEN FORM OF SHAREHOLDERS NOTICE. (a) To be in proper written form pursuant to Sections 1.8 or 1.11 hereof, a shareholders notice to the Secretary of the Corporation shall set forth in writing as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, the name, age, and business address of each such person, the principal occupation or employment of such person, the number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, and all other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including such persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (ii) as to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration) and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment; (iii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporations books, of the shareholder proposing such business or nomination and the name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is being made; (iv) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned or owned of record by the shareholder proposing such business or nomination and name of the beneficial owner if different from the shareholder; (v) any material interest of the shareholder in any such business; (vi) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such annual meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at such meeting to propose such business; and (vii) if the shareholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such shareholders proposal, a representation to that effect. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder if the shareholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to make a nomination or present a proposal at an annual meeting and such shareholders nominee or proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by management of the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting; provided, however, that if such shareholder does not appear or send a qualified 2 representative to present such nominee or proposal at such annual meeting, the Corporation need not present such nominee or proposal for a vote at such meeting notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 

   ##### 

  

    

1.12, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person
must be authorized by a writing executed by such shareholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as
proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such
writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of
such writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders. The
Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such
proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.

 Section 6.4 WAIVER OF NOTICE OF MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any provision of the articles of incorporation or these By-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the shareholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the articles of incorporation or these By-laws. 

  

 Section 6.5 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

  

 (b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of (or in a similar capacity in respect of) another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.5, to the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including, without limitation, the dismissal of an action without prejudice, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.5, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against all costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. 

  

 (d) Any indemnification under Sections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.5 (unless ordered by a court) shall be paid by the Corporation unless a determination is made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote or a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the shareholders, that indemnification of the director or officer is not proper in the circumstances because he had not met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.5. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term "Corporation" shall include any predecessor of the Corporation and any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation or merger. Any director or officer of the Corporation serving (i) another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, of which a majority of the equity interests entitled to vote in the election of its directors or the equivalent is controlled by the Corporation, or (ii) any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any entity referred to in clause (i), in any capacity shall be deemed to be doing so at the request of the Corporation and action by a person with respect to any employee benefit plan which such person reasonably believes to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to be action not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. The benefits of this Section 6.5 shall extend to the heirs and legal representatives of any person entitled to indemnification under this section. 

  

 (f) The Corporation may indemnify any person, including any employee or agent of the Corporation, to whom the Corporation is permitted by applicable law to provide indemnification or the advancement of expenses, whether pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by, the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act or other rights created by (i) a resolution of the shareholders, (ii) a resolution of directors or (iii) an agreement providing for such indemnification, it being expressly intended that these By-laws authorize the creation of other rights in any such manner. The right to be indemnified and to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition authorized by this Section 6.5 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, common law, provision of the articles of incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of shareholder or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  

 (g) The right to indemnification conferred by Section (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6.5 shall, and any indemnification extended under Section (f) of this Section 6.5 may, be retroactive to events occurring prior to the adoption of this Section 6.5 and shall continue to exist after the rescission or restrictive modification hereof with respect to events occurring prior thereto, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) Any person entitled to be indemnified as a matter of right pursuant to this provision may elect, to the extent permitted by law, to have the right to indemnification interpreted on the basis of the applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the action or proceeding, or on the basis of the applicable law in effect at the time indemnification is sought. The right to be indemnified pursuant to this provision shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding (including investigations by any governmental or quasi-governmental agency and all costs, charges and expenses incurred in preparing for any threatened action, suit or proceeding) in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this provision. No security shall be required for such undertaking and such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the recipients financial ability to make repayment. The repayment of such charges and expenses incurred by other employees and agents of the Corporation which are paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as permitted by this Section 6.5 may be required upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. The Board of Directors may, in the manner set forth above, and subject to the approval of the person entitled to be indemnified authorize the Corporations counsel to represent such person, in any action, suit or proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such action, suit or proceeding. 

  

 (i) Any indemnification under Sections (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6.5 or advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section (h) of this Section 6.5 shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days, upon the written request of the director or officer, directed to the Secretary of the Corporation. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by Section (h) of this Section 6.5 shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within 60 days. Such persons costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section (h) of this Section 6.5 where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section (a) or (b) of this Section 6.5, but the burden of proving that such standard of conduct has not been met shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel and its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section (a) and (b) of this Section 6.5, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel and its shareholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (j) For purposes of this Section 6.5: 

  

 (i) "Fines" shall include any penalties and any excise or similar taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; 

  

 (ii) A person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in Sections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.5; 

  

 (iii) Service as a partner, trustee or member of management or similar committee of a partnership or joint venture, or as a director, officer, employee or agent of a corporation which is a partner, trustee or joint venturer, shall be considered service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. 

  

 (k) SAVINGS CLAUSE. If this Section 6.5 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and above expenses with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Section 6.5 that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law. 

  

 Section 6.6 INTERESTED DIRECTORS; QUORUM. Except as the articles of incorporation may otherwise provide, no contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, or, if the votes of the disinterested directors are insufficient to constitute an act of the Board of Directors as defined in Section 55 of the BCA, by unanimous vote of the disinterested directors; or (2) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the shareholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board, a committee thereof or the shareholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction. 

  

 Section 6.7 FORM OF RECORDS. Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, magnetic tape, computer disks, photographs, 

   ##### 

  

    

microphotographs or any other information storage device, provided that the
records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a
reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon
the request of any person entitled to inspect the same. 

  

 Section 6.8 AMENDMENT OF BY-LAWS. Except where otherwise specified in a specific By-law, these By-laws may be amended or repealed, and new By-laws adopted, by the vote of not less than a majority of the entire Board of Directors.

NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION  

  

 Section 7.1 NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to shareholders pursuant to the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act ("MIBCA"), the articles of incorporation or these by-laws, any notice to shareholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the MIBCA, the articles of incorporation or these by-laws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the shareholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the shareholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: 

  

 (a) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent; and 

  

 (b) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice. 

 

However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall
not invalidate any meeting or other action. 

  

Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: 

   

 (a) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; 

  

 (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; 

  

 (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the shareholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (I) such posting and 

  

 (II) the giving of such separate notice; and 

  

 (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the shareholder. 

   ##### 

  

 

An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer
agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a
form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima
facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 

   

 Section 7.2 DEFINITION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 

  

 Section 7.3 INAPPLICABILITY. Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Sections 37(4) or 101 of the MIBCA.
