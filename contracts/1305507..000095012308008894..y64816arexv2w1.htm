corporation now or hereafter organized under the BCA may have.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIXTH: (a)&nbsp;From and after the date hereof, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as the then total number of directors constituting the entire
Board of Directors permits, with the term of office of one or another of the three classes expiring
each year. The Board of Directors shall by resolution initially divide the Board of Directors into
three classes, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the 2009 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders, the term of office of the second class to expire at the 2010 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders and the term of office of the third class to expire at the 2011 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders. Commencing with the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the directors elected at an
annual meeting of shareholders to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be identified as
being directors of the same class as the directors whom they succeed, and each of them shall hold
office until the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders and until such director&#146;s
successor is elected and has qualified. Any vacancies in the Board of Directors for any reason, and
any created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, may be filled by
the vote of not less than 66 2/3% of the members of the Board of Directors then in office, although
less than a quorum, and any directors so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the
class for which such directors shall have been chosen and until their successors shall be elected
and qualified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the
holders of any one or more series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
class, to elect one or more directors of the Corporation, the then authorized number of directors
shall be increased by the number of directors so to be elected, and the terms of the director or
directors elected by such holders shall expire at the next succeeding annual meeting of
shareholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws
of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that some lesser percentage may be specified by
law, these Articles of Incorporation or the by-laws of the Corporation), any director or the entire
Board of Directors of the Corporation may be removed at any time, but only for cause and only by
the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this
purpose as one class) cast at a meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of any
one or more series of preferred stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect
one or more directors of the Corporation, the provisions of this Section (c)&nbsp;of this Article&nbsp;Sixth
shall not apply with respect to the director or directors elected by such holders of preferred
stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders
by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the election. Cumulative voting, as defined in
Division 7, Section&nbsp;71(2) of the BCA, shall not be used to elect directors.

Directors, and the shareholders may not make additional by-laws and may not alter or repeal any
by-law, except where such power to amend or repeal is expressly granted by the BCA. Notwithstanding

proposed special meeting. If there is a failure to hold the annual meeting within a period of
ninety (90)&nbsp;days after the date designated therefor, or if no date has been designated for a period
of thirteen (13)&nbsp;months after the organization of the Corporation or after its last annual meeting,
holders of not less than 10% of the shares entitled to vote in an election of directors may, in
writing, demand the call of a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting specifying the time
thereof, which shall not be less than two (2)&nbsp;nor more than three (3)&nbsp;months from the date of such
call. The Secretary of the Corporation upon receiving the written demand shall promptly give notice
of such meeting, or if the secretary fails to do so within five (5)&nbsp;business days thereafter, any
shareholder signing such demand may give such notice. Such notice shall state the purpose or
purposes of the proposed special meeting. The business transacted at any special meeting shall be
limited to the purposes stated when the meeting is called by the Board of Directors or in the
notice of such meeting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Any action required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special meeting
of shareholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting
forth the action so taken, is signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to
the subject matter thereof.

not be by written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders of a majority

these By-laws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a
meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction
of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the shareholders, directors,
or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so
required by the articles of incorporation or these By-laws.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.5 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. (a)&nbsp;The Corporation shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact
that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action,
suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith
and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful.

made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
Corporation to procure judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or
officer of (or in a similar capacity in respect of) another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit
if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for
negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the
extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application
that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem
proper.

Section&nbsp;6.5 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, common law, provision of the articles of incorporation, By-laws,

elect, to the extent permitted by law, to have the right to indemnification interpreted on the
basis of the applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving
rise to the action or proceeding, or on the basis of the applicable law in effect at the time
indemnification is sought. The right to be indemnified pursuant to this provision shall be a
contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in
defending any action, suit or proceeding (including investigations by any governmental or
quasi-governmental agency and all costs, charges and expenses incurred in preparing for any
threatened action, suit or proceeding) in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that
the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his capacity as a director or
officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a
director or officer, including without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance
of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to
the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it should ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified under this provision. No security shall be required for such undertaking
and such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the recipient&#146;s financial ability to
make repayment. The repayment of such charges and expenses incurred by other employees and agents
of the Corporation which are paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
action, suit or proceeding as permitted by this Section&nbsp;6.5 may be required upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. The Board of Directors may, in the
manner set forth above, and subject to the approval of the person entitled to be indemnified
authorize the Corporation&#146;s counsel to represent such person, in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether or not the Corporation is a party to such action, suit or proceeding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;Any indemnification under Sections (a), (b)&nbsp;or (c)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;6.5 or advance of
costs, charges and expenses under Section (h)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;6.5 shall be made promptly, and in
any event within 60&nbsp;days, upon the written request of the director or officer, directed to the
Secretary of the Corporation. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by Section (h)&nbsp;of
this Section&nbsp;6.5 shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent
jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition
thereof is made within 60&nbsp;days. Such person&#146;s costs and expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his right to indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, in any
such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses
under Section (h)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;6.5 where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by
the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section (a)&nbsp;or
(b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;6.5, but the burden of proving that such standard of conduct has not been met
shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, its independent legal counsel and its shareholders) to have made a determination prior
to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section (a)&nbsp;and
(b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;6.5, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel and its shareholders)
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action
or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
