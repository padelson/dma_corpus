shall be given timely access to all supporting workpapers used in
the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

(ii) The Stockholder Representative may dispute any amounts reflected on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet or the calculation of Closing Working Capital or
Closing Debt by notifying Parent in writing of each disputed item, specifying
the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis for such dispute, within 30 days of Parents delivery of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet pursuant to clause (i) above. If the Stockholder
Representative delivers a notice of disagreement within such 30-day period,
the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the 45 days following
such delivery, each use good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to finally determine the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Debt. If the
Stockholder Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement
concerning the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital and/or
Closing Debt during such 45-day period, they shall promptly thereafter submit
the dispute to the Accounting Referee for resolution pursuant to Section
2.6(g).

(iii) The Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt
shall be deemed conclusively determined for purposes of this Agreement upon
the earlier to occur of (x) the failure of the Stockholder Representative to
notify Parent of a dispute within 30 days of Parents delivery of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet as set forth in clause (ii) above, (y) the written
resolution of all disputes pursuant to clause (ii) by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, and (z) the resolution of all disputes by the
Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 2.6(g). Within three Business Days of
such conclusive determination, if (x) the Closing Working Capital is less than
the Estimated Working Capital, and/or (y) the Closing Debt is greater than the
Estimated Debt (the absolute value of the amount by which (A) the Estimated
Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated Debt exceeds (B) the Closing Working
Capital _minus_ the Closing Debt, the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), then Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in
writing to transfer from the Escrow Amount to Parent an amount equal to the
Adjustment Amount, and the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed a decrease to the
Merger Consideration. 

(g) _Adjustment Dispute Resolution_. If the Stockholder Representative and
Parent are unable to reach agreement concerning the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, Closing Working Capital, and/or Closing Debt pursuant to Section
2.6(f), they shall submit such dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, or such
other nationally recognized independent accounting expert selected by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder Representative (the " _Accounting
Referee_ ") for resolution pursuant to this Section 2.6(g) and instruct the
Accounting Referee to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
final determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the calculation of
Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Debt, as the case may be. In making
such determination and calculations, the Accounting Referee shall consider
only those items or amounts in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or Parents
 



 

\- 19 -  calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Debt as to which the
Stockholder Representative has disagreed in writing, and shall apply the
same principles, practices and policies utilized by the Company in its
preparation of the Company Balance Sheet. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall instruct the Accounting Referee to use its best efforts
to deliver to the Stockholder Representative and Parent as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than 30 days after submission) a report
setting forth the Accounting Referees calculation of the disputed amounts.
Such report shall be final and binding upon the Stockholder Representative,
the Stockholders, Parent and the Interim Surviving Corporation and the
resulting Closing Date Balance Sheet and calculation of Closing Working
Capital and Closing Debt shall be final for all purposes of this
Agreement. Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Stockholders, on the other hand, shall each pay their own fees
and expenses and one-half of the costs and charges of the Accounting Referees
review and report. The Stockholders share of these costs will be deducted
from the Escrow Amount, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
10.5(b).

(h) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued, but in lieu thereof, each Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled
to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (based on the aggregate
number of shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Stockholder) shall be
entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, _multiplied_   _by_
(ii) the Parent Average Closing Price.

(i) _Withholding and Deductions_. Each of Parent, the Company, the
Interim Surviving Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, the Transaction
Bonus Plan or any Related Agreement to any Person (i) such amounts as Parent,
the Company, the Interim Surviving Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity,
the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent may determine it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
any other provision of Tax Law and (ii) the amount of any outstanding loans
(including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any amounts in respect
thereof) owed by such Person to the Company at the Effective Time. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld pursuant to clause (i) above, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid
to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
and Parent shall timely deposit such withheld amounts with the applicable Tax
Authority. Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Final Surviving
Entity are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market
value such portion of the Stock Consideration as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to Parent or the Interim Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, in order to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding
requirements to the extent that there is not sufficient cash consideration in
connection with any such payment to make such payment fully in cash.

2.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Stockholder who has demanded and
perfected appraisal or dissenters rights for such shares in accordance with
the DGCL or the CGCL, as applicable, and who, as of the Effective Time, has
not effectively withdrawn or lost such  



 

\- 20 -  appraisal or dissenters rights (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6, but the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL or the CGCL, as applicable.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(a), if any Stockholder who
holds Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through passage of time, failure to demand or perfect, or otherwise)
the right to demand and perfect appraisal or dissenters rights under the DGCL
or the CGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such holders shares that were Dissenting Shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to and subject to Section 2.6 (subject to the
escrow contribution provisions of Section 2.6(d) and the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article X hereof) without interest
thereon upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to the DGCL or
the CGCL, as applicable, on the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL or demands for purchase under the CGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Capital Stock
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
Computershare Shareholder Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary
Equiserve Trust Company N.A. (collectively, " _Equiserve_ ") or, if Equiserve
is unwilling or unable to act, another United States bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_ On or before the fifth Business Day after the
Closing, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock, (A) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Cash Consideration and
certificates representing the Stock Consideration. Following the Effective
Time and delivery to the Exchange Agent of a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal, together with surrender of a Certificate (or
Certificates) for cancellation, each Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration to which such
Stockholder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6, the Cash Consideration to
which such Stockholder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6 (less the Escrow
Amount to be deposited with the Escrow Agent on such holders behalf) and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.6(h). The
Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be canceled. Following the Effective Time,
until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that,  



 

\- 21 -  prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Article II.

(c) _Parent to Provide Parent Common Stock and Cash to Exchange Agent_. On or
before the second Business Day after the Closing, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.8 the Stock
Consideration and Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.6 as
Merger Consideration in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount
with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and Article X.

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.8, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation,
the Final Surviving Entity or any party hereto shall be liable to any Person
for any amount properly paid to a public official in compliance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law 

(e) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange therefor until the holder
of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Section 2.8. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest
shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company
Capital Stock for cash.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid or payable upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Interim Surviving Corporation of shares of
Company Capital Stock that were outstanding at the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Interim Surviving
Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be
returned to the presenter for exchange in accordance with the exchange
procedures set forth in Section 2.8.

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration required pursuant to Section 2.6 (subject to the escrow
contribution provisions of Section 2.6(d)) at the times set forth in Article
II; _provided_ , _that_ Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a non-refundable bond in such amount as
Parent may determine (as of the date hereof, such amount is the greater of $20
and 3% of the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares
evidenced by such Certificate) and/or provide  



 

\- 22 -  an indemnity acceptable to Parent against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation, the Final Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and make any processing fee payments to the Exchange
Agent.

2.11 _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or will have established to the satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

2.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Interim Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and

their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.

Schedules_ ") corresponding to the applicable Section and subsection or clause
of this Article III (or disclosed in any other section, subsection or clause
of the Company Schedules _provided_ _that_ it is reasonably apparent on its
face, upon a reading of the disclosure without any independent knowledge on

responsive to such other Section, subsection or clause of this Article III),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as

jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of
the Company Certificate of Incorporation and its By-laws, each as amended to
date and in full force and effect on the date hereof. The Company has not
violated the Company Certificate of Incorporation or its By-laws in any

applicable) as a foreign organization in each jurisdiction listed on _Schedule
3.2(a)(ii)_, which constitute all of the jurisdictions in which the conduct
of its business or the ownership, leasing, holding or use of its properties
makes such qualification necessary, except such other jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of each Subsidiarys
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other comparable organizational
documents), each as amended to date and in full force and effect on the date
hereof. None of the Subsidiaries has violated its certificate of incorporation

Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding
Subsidiary Securities. All of the outstanding share capital of each Subsidiary
has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and non-
assessable.

in consideration of services rendered, by delivery of a full recourse
promissory note, or any other form permitted by the DCGL. All outstanding
Company Options have been offered, issued and delivered by the Company in

date of grant of such Company Option within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code regardless of whether such Company Option is otherwise intended to be an
incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.

rights or "drag-along" rights) of any Company Capital Stock or Subsidiary
Securities. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby by the Company does not implicate any rights or obligations under the

Company Capital Stock and Company Stock Rights have been or will be properly
given or shall have properly waived any required notice prior to the Merger.

3.4 _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement, the Vesting Continuation Agreements, the Option

or intangible) in any material respect.

would otherwise be required to pay pursuant to the terms of such

its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Balance Sheet_ ") as of July 31, 2007 (such
date, the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of operations, of stockholders equity and of cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the seven-month period then ended (the

accounting principles effective in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each
other, except for the absence of footnotes in the case of the
unaudited interim Company Financial Statements. The Company Financial
Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein,
subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments which are not material in amount or significance. The

regarding the reliability of the Company Financial Statements and (ii)
accumulate and communicate to the Companys principal executive officer
and principal financial officer in a timely manner the type of information
that is required to be disclosed in the Company Financial Statements. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, any
Employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,

the Company Financial Statements. To the Companys knowledge, there have
been no instances of fraud, whether or not material, during any period
covered by the Company Financial Statements.

information to any Governmental Entity regarding the commission or possible
commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of any Law
applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part of their
respective operations. To the Companys knowledge, none of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Employee, independent contractor, consultant,
subcontractor or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary has discharged,
demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated
against an Employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of any
act of such Employee described in 18 U.S.C. Section 1514A(a).

(iii) The Leases are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, and there does not exist under any such Lease any material
default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys
knowledge, by any other Person, or any event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys knowledge, by any other Person.
The Company has delivered to Parent complete copies of all Leases, including
all amendments and agreements related thereto, and the Leases constitute the
entire agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each

under the Leases have been paid.

(iv) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries is the holder of the tenants
interest under the Leases and has not assigned the Leases nor subleased all

Information_ "), other than as expressly permitted pursuant to and in
compliance with any written agreements with such customers and the Companys
and its Subsidiaries publicly available privacy policies. The Company
has not exceeded or violated the permitted use of any Customer Information
pursuant to the terms of the customer Contracts or  



 

\- 34 -  applicable Law in any material respect. Except for information as provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to sales representatives,
distributors or resellers (which information is subject to a customary non-

respect to use of the Company Customer Information.

operation of its business as currently conducted or, with respect to Company
Products and Company Products Under Development, as currently proposed to be

required to permit the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to operate or
conduct its business as currently conducted or, with respect to Company
Products and Company Products Under Development, as currently proposed to be

would reasonably be expected to render the Company Patents or any claim
thereof invalid or unenforceable.

is in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default thereunder, nor to the knowledge of the Company is
any party obligated to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
such agreement in default thereunder. Immediately following the Closing Date,

other reasonable advance notice of, and the opportunity to participate in
(directly or through its representatives) any inquiry or investigation by, or
any material meeting or conference (whether by telecommunications or in
person) with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Antitrust Filings.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall require or be construed to require Parent or any of its
Affiliates, in order to obtain the consent or successful termination of any
review of any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, to (i) sell or hold
separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the Effective
Time, any assets, businesses or any interests in any assets or businesses, of
Parent or any of its Affiliates or of the Interim Surviving Corporation or the
Final Surviving Entity (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by
Parent or by the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity
of any assets or businesses, or any interests in any assets or businesses), or
any change in or restriction on the operation by Parent of any assets or
businesses (including any assets or businesses of the Interim Surviving
Corporation or the Final Surviving Entity), (ii) enter into any contract or be
bound by any obligation that Parent may deem in its sole discretion to have
an adverse effect on the benefits to Parent of the Merger, (iii) modify any
of the terms of this Agreement or the Merger, or the transactions contemplated

with respect to any such matters.

(d) In the event that Parent is required, in order to obtain the consent or
successful termination of any review under any Law regarding the Merger, to
take any of the actions set forth in Section 6.5(c) or if such consent or
successful termination has not been obtained within 90 days following the date
of Parent filing its Antitrust Filing under any applicable antitrust or anti-
competition Law, Parent shall have the right to abandon its efforts to obtain
approval under such antitrust or anti-competition Law of the Merger,
notwithstanding this Section 6.5. If Parent so elects to abandon its efforts
to seek such approval, it shall promptly give notice of such abandonment to
the Company.

6.6 _Conditions to the Merger; Further Assurances_. Subject to Sections
6.5(c) and 6.5(d), each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) effectuate the transactions

Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement;
and (d) at the request of another party hereto, execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably
necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the

Related Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party hereto shall be
required to modify any of the terms of this Agreement or the Merger, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in order to obtain the California
Permit.



 

\- 58 - 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company,
of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause
any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) any failure to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
of its covenants, conditions or agreements to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder and (iii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to make the timely satisfaction of any of the
conditions to the other partys obligations set forth in Article IX incapable
of satisfaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies
available to the party receiving such notice.

6.8 _Benefit Arrangements_.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.8, Parent agrees that
all full-time Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue
employment with the Interim Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall have the opportunity to
participate, or to continue to participate, in employee benefit plans and
arrangements of the Interim Surviving Corporation or, at Parents election, of
Parent, that provide the following benefits: (i) with respect to those
Continuing Employees in the United Kingdom  PHI cover (permanent health
cover), pension scheme, holiday, life assurance, BUPA medical cover and eye
cover; and (ii) with respect to those Continuing Employees outside of the
United Kingdom  medical/dental/vision insurance, life insurance and short-
term and long-term disability insurance (collectively, clauses (i) and (ii),
the " _Plans_ "). Parent intends to transition the Continuing Employees into
Plans maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries as follows: (x) with respect
to those Continuing Employees in the United Kingdom, effective no later than
January 1, 2008 or, if the Closing has not occurred by such date on the next
open enrollment or renewal date with respect thereto (other than with respect
to life assurance, BUPA medical coverage and eye cover, which shall be
effective on the later of January 1, 2008 or on the next renewal date with
respect thereto); and (y) with respect to those Continuing Employees outside
of the United Kingdom, effective January 1, 2008 or, if the Closing has not
occurred by such date on the next open enrollment or renewal date with respect
thereto. Participation of the Continuing Employees in such Plans shall be in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plans; _provided_ , _however_
, _that_ nothing in this Section 6.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
limit the right of Parent or the Interim Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate any such benefit at any time. Nothing in this Section 6.8 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee to employment with Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation or
any other Subsidiary of Parent, and the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment, if permitted under applicable Law.

(b) Parent will cause the Continuing Employees (i) to have benefits (excluding
equity compensation) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the
benefits provided by either, at Parents election, (x) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to the Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents)
immediately prior to the Closing Date, or (y) Parent or its Subsidiaries to
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents)
serving in comparable positions. Upon the completion of the transition of the
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to participation in its
Plans following the Closing Date as set forth in Section 6.8(a), (i) Parent
will allow such Continuing Employees and  



 

\- 59 -  their eligible dependents to participate in such Plans on terms no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or
its Subsidiaries, (ii) each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under such Plan (excluding
any stock option or equity incentive plans of Parent) for years of service
with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing Date, and
(iii) subject to any required third party insurers consent, Parent will cause
any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods
and evidence of insurability requirements under any group health plans of
Parent in which such employees and their eligible dependents will participate
to be waived (to the extent not applicable under the Companys plans) and will
provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles prior to the Closing Date
but in the plan year which includes the Closing Date for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements
under any such plans that may apply for such plan year after the Closing
Date.

(c) The Company shall take all necessary actions to cause its 401(k) plan to
be terminated prior to the Effective Time, including having the Companys
board of directors vote to so terminate the Companys 401(k) plan. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall permit the Continuing
Employees to enroll in Parents 401(k) plan.

(d) Upon written notice from Parent to the Company prior to the Closing and
subject to applicable Law as determined by the Company in its sole reasonable
discretion, the Company shall effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time terminate the employment of any Employee who has not executed and
delivered to the Company an Option Reset Agreement and a Vesting
Continuation Agreement (each such Employee, a " _Terminated Employee_ ").

6.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company_.

(a) _Indemnification Obligations_. During the period ending six years after
the Closing Date, Parent will ensure that the Interim Surviving Corporation
or any successor thereto fulfills and honors the obligations of the Company to
the Companys directors and officers (the " _Indemnified D andOs_") pursuant to
the terms of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the
Company as in effect at the Effective Time.

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall purchase a directors and officers
liability insurance policy for the Companys directors and officers providing
for coverage for six years following the Closing Date (the " _D andO Policy_").
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Interim Surviving Corporation and the
Final Surviving Entity to not, take any action to terminate the DandO Policy.

(c) _Sale of Assets_. Parent will not, nor will Parent permit the Interim
Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Corporation to, sell all or
substantially all of the Parents, the Interim Surviving Corporations or the
Final Surviving Corporations assets unless, in the event the acquiring
Person (A) has a net worth less than $500,000,000, Parent guarantees the
obligations imposed by this Section 6.9 or (B) has a net worth equal to or
greater than $500,000,000, the acquiring Person assumes the obligations
imposed by this Section 6.9. If Parent, the Interim Surviving Corporation or
the Final Surviving Corporation is party to any merger or consolidation that
would require the acquiring Person to assume the obligations imposed by this
Section 6.9 in order for such obligations to be binding on such acquiring
Person  



 

\- 60 -  by operation of law, Parent shall in the event the acquiring Person (A) has
a net worth less than $500,000,000, guarantee the obligations imposed by this
Section 6.9 or (B) has a net worth equal to or greater than $500,000,000,
provide for the acquiring Person to assume the obligations imposed by this
Section 6.9.

(d) _Termination of D andO Indemnification Agreements_. The Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate each of the DandO Indemnification
Agreements.

6.10 _Transaction Bonus Plan_. Immediately following the Closing Parent will
assume, and will promptly thereafter satisfy, the Companys obligations under
the Transaction Bonus Plan.

6.11 _No Solicitation_. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof, the Company
shall not (nor shall the Company permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective employees, stockholders, advisors, agents, representatives
or Affiliates to), directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions
with any Person other than Parent and its designees: (i) solicit, encourage,
seek, entertain, support, assist, initiate or participate in any
inquiry, negotiations or discussions, or enter into any agreement, with
respect to any offer or proposal to acquire all or any material part of the
business, assets, Intellectual Property or technologies of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or any amount of the Company Capital Stock or any Subsidiary
Securities (whether or not already outstanding), whether by merger, purchase
of assets, purchase of securities, tender offer, exclusive license or
otherwise, or effect any such transaction (a " _Proposal_ "), (ii) disclose
any confidential information to any Person concerning the business,
Intellectual Property, technologies or properties of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (other than in the ordinary course of business in connection
with sales, distribution or product development matters), or afford to any
Person access to their respective properties, technologies, books or records,
not customarily afforded such access, (iii) assist or cooperate with
any Person to make any Proposal, or (iv) enter into any agreement with any
Person with respect to a Proposal. The Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any such negotiations, discussions or agreements (other
than with Parent) that are the subject matter of clause (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv) above. In the event that the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates
shall receive, prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement, any offer, proposal, or request, directly or indirectly, with
respect to a Proposal, or any request for disclosure or access as referenced
in clause (ii) above, the Company shall immediately (x) suspend any
discussions with such offeror or Person with regard to such offer, proposal,
or request and (y) notify Parent thereof, including information as to the
material terms of the Proposal and the identity of the Person making such
Proposal or request.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions of this Section 6.11 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.11 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
above by any Employee, stockholder, agent, advisor, representative or
Affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
the Company.



 

\- 61 - 6.12 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall obtain the
resignation of all officers and directors of the Company and such officers
and directors of its Subsidiaries as Parent designates in writing, effective
as of the Effective Time.

6.13 _Employee Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreements_. At the
request of Parent, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Continuing Employees to execute, prior to the Closing, Parents
form of Employee Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement, it being
understood that such Employee Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreements
shall be effective contingent upon the Closing.

6.14 _Company Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume the Company Option Plan and each Company Option that is outstanding as
of the Effective Time (each, an " _Assumed Company Option_ ") together with
the option agreement representing each such Assumed Company Option; _provided,
that_ (i) each Assumed Company Option shall thereafter be exercisable for
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as equals the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number), (ii) each
such Assumed Company Option shall be and become exercisable only as provided
in the applicable Option Reset Agreement and (iii) the exercise price per
share of each such Assumed Company Option shall be equal to the exercise
price per share set forth in the option agreement for such Assumed Company
Option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the next whole
cent). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing adjustments shall be effected
in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The Company and the
administrator of the Company Option Plan (the " _Administrator_ ") shall each
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the Company Option Plan
to be duly amended to the extent required to permit the assumption of the
Assumed Company Options as contemplated by this Section 6.14; (ii) the Company
Option Plan and all Company Options that are issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time to be assumed by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Section 6.14; and (iii) each holder of an Assumed Company Option to
execute an Option Reset Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_
(" _Option Reset Agreement_ "). The holders of Company Options have been or
will be properly given by the Company, or shall have properly waived, any
required notice prior to the Merger. The Company and the Administrator shall
also cause the Company Option Plan to be amended such that, after the
Effective Time, (x) no further option grants may be made under the Company
Option Plan, and (y) outstanding Company Options cannot be repriced. Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance under the
Company Option Plan a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of the Assumed Company Options. Subject to applicable
Law, within 90 days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
the Assumed Company Options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts at
least equivalent to those used in maintaining the effectiveness of Parents
other registration statements on Form S-8 to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Assumed Company Options remain outstanding.



 

\- 62 - 6.15 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. The Company shall take all such
steps as may be necessary to (i) terminate, as of the Closing, each of the
Investor Agreements and (ii) deliver all required notifications of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby to the holders of Company
Capital Stock and Company Stock Rights. 

6.16 _Certain Deliveries_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to Parent on one or more CD-ROM disks a complete and accurate
electronic copy of the "DataSite" as it existed on the date of this Agreement.
Delivery of any item included in the CD-ROM disks pursuant to this Section
6.16 shall constitute "delivery" within the meaning of Article III as of the
date of this Agreement.

6.17 _Company Affiliates_. _Schedule 6.17 _sets forth those Persons who
may be "affiliates" of the Company, in the Companys reasonable judgment,
within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act (" _Rule
145_ ") (each such Person, a " _Rule 145 Affiliate_"). The Company shall
provide Parent such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably
request for purposes of reviewing such list. Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer
agent for Parent Common Stock and to place the following legend on the
certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by any Rule 145
Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE
145(d) OR PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL,
REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, THAT SUCH TRANSFER
IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED."

The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend) and Parent shall so instruct its transfer
agent, if the Rule 145 Affiliate delivers to Parent (i) satisfactory written
evidence that the shares have been sold in compliance with Rule 145 (in which
case, the substitute certificate shall be issued in the name of the
transferee), or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that public sale of the shares by the
holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145.

6.18 _Blue Sky Laws_. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with the securities and blue sky Laws of all jurisdictions which are
applicable to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock pursuant hereto. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent as may
be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky Laws of
all jurisdictions which are applicable in connection with the issuance of
Parent Common Stock pursuant hereto.



 

\- 63 - 6.19 _Nasdaq Global Select Market_. To the extent required by The Nasdaq
Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger to be authorized for listing on Nasdaq as of the
Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance.

6.20 _Conversion of Preferred Stock_. The Company shall solicit the consent of
the holders of Company Preferred Stock to mandatorily convert all of the
Company Preferred Stock.

6.21 _Parent Nasdaq Determination_. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to submit to The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC a request for a
written interpretation of Rule 4350(i)(1) of the Marketplace Rules of the
National Association of Securities Dealers that would permit Parent to make
the Parent Nasdaq Determination and to obtain such determination. Promptly
upon request by the Company or its legal counsel, Parent shall advise the
Company regarding the status of its efforts to obtain such request for a
written interpretation.

TAX MATTERS

8.1 _Tax Representations_. Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the
Company Schedules corresponding to the applicable Section and subsection or

real property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been
either a "controlled corporation" or a "distributing corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) with respect to a transaction

the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law)
by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise, and, not including
any changes required to be made as a result of entering into Parents federal

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of a

consolidated, unitary or other affiliated group Tax Return for state, local or
foreign Tax purposes (other than a group the common parent of which is the
Company), and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company) under Treasury

or foreign Tax Law), or as a transferee or successor, or by contract, or
otherwise.

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any
material election in respect of Taxes, adopt or change any material accounting
method in respect of Taxes, enter into any closing agreement, settle any
material claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, or consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material claim
or assessment in respect of Taxes, except with the prior written consent of
Parent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(b) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred by the Stockholders in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Stockholders when due, and
the Stockholders will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable Law, Parent will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation. At Parents discretion, the amount paid to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Taxes payable by
such Person pursuant to this Section 8.2(b). Any amount so withheld will be
promptly remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority. 



 

\- 70 - (c) _Tax Returns_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall prepare and timely
file or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all appropriate Tax
Returns in respect of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and their assets or
activities that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date. The
Company will promptly provide or make available to Parent copies of all Tax
Returns that are filed after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide and make
available to Parent all relevant information, records, and documents relating
to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected
to be necessary or useful in connection with any preparation of any Tax
Return, or for any audit, examination, or proceeding relating to Taxes.
The Company shall provide assistance to Parent as reasonably requested in
preparing and filing Tax Returns and responding to Tax audits or Tax authority
disputes.

(d) _Tax Contests_. Parent will have the right to conduct any Tax audit or

Corporation and after the LLC Merger Effective Time relating to the Final
Surviving Entity, in each case as set forth in Section 10.4.

(e) _Parachute Payments_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that no agreement, contract, arrangement or plan (including
the Company Options and the Transaction Bonus Plan) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or, for this purpose, any options granted by Parent to
employees of the Company pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. 

(f) _Reorganization Status_. By executing this Agreement, the parties adopt a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Secs. 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368-3 with respect to the Integrated Merger, in which the Merger and the
LLC Merger are intended to constitute integrated steps. After the Effective
Time, none of the parties to this Agreement will, or will cause or permit any
of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action that reasonably would be
expected to cause the Integrated Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no
party is making any assurances or representations as to the status of the
Integrated Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and no opinion of counsel with respect to such status has been or
will be obtained except as set forth in Section 7.3(g). Based upon the known
facts and Law as of the date of this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, and the stockholders of the Company agree to file its Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the Integrated Merger qualifying as a tax-
free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses
(including all Losses included within the Threshold Amount). 



 

\- 77 - (b) The maximum aggregate indemnification obligation of each Stockholder
pursuant to Section 10.2(a), other than with respect to any claim regarding

10.3(b)), shall be limited to the amount equal to such Stockholders Pro Rata
Share of the Escrow Amount.

(c) The indemnification obligation of each Stockholder for money damages
pursuant to Section 10.2(a) with respect to any claim regarding the failure of

Share of the Merger Consideration actually received pursuant to this Agreement
and the Merger (including deemed receipt of such Stockholders Pro Rata Share
of the Escrow Amount).

(e) No claim shall be made by any Stockholder or the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of any Stockholder for breach of any representation
or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub unless and until the aggregate amount

make a claim for all such damages, including those within the Threshold
Amount. The maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for money
damages for breach of their representations and warranties shall be limited

(f) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Company,
and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties
based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations, will
not be limited or affected by any investigation conducted by Parent or Merger
Sub or any agent of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent or Merger Sub or any
agent of Parent or Merger Sub at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation, and no Indemnified Party shall be required
to show that it relied on any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation of the Company in order to be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Article X. The waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of any conditions set
forth in Article IX will not affect or limit the provisions of this Article X
in any manner.

sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for any matters relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any certificate or instrument delivered
pursuant hereto shall be the rights to indemnification set forth in this

\- 78 - Notwithstanding anything in this Article X to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit (i) any right or remedy for fraud or (ii) any equitable
remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific
performance; _provided, that_ the limitations on monetary damages set forth in
Section 10.3(d) shall apply to any Stockholder that does not actually commit
any fraud.

10.4 _Procedures_.

(a) _General_. Promptly after the discovery by any Indemnified Party of any
Loss or Losses, claim or breach, including any claim (a " _Third Party Claim_
") by a third party (" _Third Party Claimant_ ") that reasonably would be
expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative
a certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_ ") that:

(i) states that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses,
or reasonably anticipates that it may or will incur liability for Losses, for
which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement; and

(ii) specifies in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable, the Losses
included in the amount so stated, the date (if any) such item was paid or
properly accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of
the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or
claim to which each such item is related and, to the extent computable, the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled hereunder;

_provided_ , _that_ no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying
the Stockholder Representative shall relieve the Stockholders of any
liability or obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Stockholders
have been materially prejudiced thereby, and then only to such extent.

(b) _Objections_. If the Stockholder Representative objects to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Claim Certificate, the Stockholder Representative shall
deliver a written notice to such effect to the Indemnified Party within 30
days after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of such Claim
Certificate. Thereafter, the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified
Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties within 60 days of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such written
objection with respect to each of such claims to which the Stockholder
Representative has objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder
Representative agree with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party
and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly prepare and sign a
memorandum setting forth such agreement and, if applicable, an instruction to
the Escrow Agent. Should the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder
Representative fail to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or
amounts, then each party shall be entitled to pursue its available remedies
for resolving the claim for indemnification.



 

\- 79 - (c) _Third Party Claims_. The Indemnified Party shall have the right in its
sole discretion to conduct the defense of any Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , _that_ any settlement of any such Third Party Claim shall be
effected only with the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall consult with the Indemnifying Party in
a reasonable manner at reasonable times regarding the status of any Third
Party Claim, including regarding litigation strategy, bona fide settlement
offers or mediations and material results of discovery and investigation, and
shall furnish all documents reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party to
assess the rights and obligations of the parties to any Third Party Claims. 

(d) _Stockholder Defense; Settlement_. In the event the Indemnified Party
elects not to defend the Third Party Claim, the Stockholder Representative
may defend such claim at the Stockholders sole cost and expense, which
expense may be reimbursed from the Escrow Amount as set forth in Section
10.5(b), with counsel selected by the Stockholder Representative, such
counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In such event,
neither the Stockholders nor the Stockholder Representative shall have any
right to settle, adjust or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party against whom the Third-Party Claim
has been asserted, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(e) _Agreed Claims_. Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to
which the Stockholder Representative did not object in writing within 30 days
of receipt of such Claim Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a
memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 10.4(b) and claims
for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of
resolution by arbitration or of a final non-appealable judicial determination
are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_." The
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment for any Agreed Claims within
five Business Days of the determination of the amount of any such Agreed
Claims.

10.5 _Stockholder Representative; Power of Attorney_.

(a) _Appointment; Authority_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger by the Stockholders, each Stockholder (regardless
of whether or not such Stockholder votes in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger, whether at a meeting or by written
consent in lieu thereof) hereby initially appoints, as of the date of this
Agreement, John G. Connors (together with its permitted successors, the "
_Stockholder Representative_ "), as his, her or its true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact to enter into any Related Agreement and any other agreement
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on
behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party) and/or the Escrow Agent
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions
and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby; (ii) authorize deliveries
(including by means of not objecting to claims) to Parent of cash from the
Escrow Amount; (iii) object to any claims pursuant to Section 10.4; (iv)
consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and agree to arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, such claims; (v) assert, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and agree to arbitration and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by
any Indemnified Party, against any such Stockholder or by any such Stockholder
against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party
and any such Stockholder, in  



 

\- 80 -  each case relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (vi) to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, amend this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
Related Agreement or any other agreement referred to herein or contemplated
hereby; and (vii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in
each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any
circumstance. The Person serving as the Stockholder Representative may be
replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Amount upon not less than ten days prior written notice to Parent and
with Parents written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of
the Stockholders. The Stockholder Representative accepts its appointment
hereunder.

(b) _No Liability_. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any
Stockholder for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholder
Representative while acting in good faith and any act done or omitted pursuant
to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Stockholders shall jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholder
Representative and hold it harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder. The Stockholder Representative shall
be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his
duties (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees of counsel), and
such fees shall be paid out of the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement provided that the sum of the amount of such reimbursement and
the amount of any costs deducted pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement shall be limited to $200,000 in the aggregate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , _that_ such $200,000 limit shall in no way limit the Stockholder
Representatives right to indemnification under this Section 10.5(b); and
_provided_ , _further_ , _that_ the Stockholder Representative shall be
reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his duties
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees of counsel) in excess of
such $200,000 limit, but only out of any portion of the Escrow Amount that
would otherwise be released and paid to the Stockholders pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) _Access_. The Stockholder Representative shall have reasonable access to
relevant information about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the
Companys employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its
rights hereunder; provided that the Stockholder Representative shall treat
confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the
Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to
treat such information confidentially) and provided that Parent shall not be
required to disclose any information that would result in a loss of applicable
attorney-client or other privilege unless the Stockholder Representative
agrees to enter into a customary joint defense agreement and such joint
defense agreement is appropriate under the circumstances.

(d) _Notice_. Any notice or communication given or received by, and any
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to or
by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
 



 

\- 81 -  agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Stockholder; and each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to
or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and
every such Stockholder. Each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent are
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Representative.

(e) _Role of Stockholder Representative_. Without limiting the generality or
effect of Section 10.5(a), any and all claims and disputes between or among
any Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative and/or any one or more
Stockholders relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall in the case of any claim or
dispute asserted by or against or involving any such Stockholder (other than
any claim against or dispute with the Stockholder Representative), be asserted
or otherwise addressed solely by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of
such Stockholder (and not by such Stockholder acting on its own behalf).

10.6 _No Subrogation_. Following the Closing, no Stockholder shall have any
right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to any indemnification made by or on behalf of any
Stockholder under Section 10.2 if the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

10.7 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Company, Parent and the
Stockholders agree to treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this
Article X as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes
and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so by
applicable Tax Law pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a)
of the Code.
