were made only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and solely for the benefit of XenSource and Citrix as of specific dates, may be subject to important limitations and qualifications agreed to by XenSource and Citrix and included in
confidential disclosure schedules provided by XenSource to Citrix in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, and may not be complete. Furthermore, these representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating
contractual risk between XenSource and Citrix instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may or may not have been accurate as of any specific date and do not purport to be accurate as of the date of the filing of the Merger Agreement by
Citrix with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts, since they were intended to be for the
benefit of, and to be limited to, Citrix and XenSource.</I></B> </FONT></P>
