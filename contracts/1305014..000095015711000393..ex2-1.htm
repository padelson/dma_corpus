(c) Buyer shall, following the Closing through the date that the Final
Statement becomes such in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.4(f),
take all actions reasonably necessary or desirable to maintain and preserve
all accounting Books and Records, policies and procedures on which the Initial
Statement is based or on which the Final Statement is to be based so as not to
impede or delay the determination of the Initial Working Capital, the Initial
Net Indebtedness and the Initial Swap Termination Costs or the preparation of
the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement or the Final Statement in
the manner and utilizing the methods permitted by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Sellers' Representative shall notify Buyer in writing (the "Notice of
Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement") on or prior to the expiration of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period if Sellers' Representative disagrees
with the Initial Statement, the Initial Working Capital, the Initial Net
Indebtedness or the Initial Swap Termination Costs. The Notice of Purchase
Price Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such disagreement, the amounts involved and Sellers' Representative's
determination of the amount of the Initial Working Capital, the Initial Net
Indebtedness and the Initial Swap Termination Costs, as applicable. If no
Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement is received by Buyer on or
prior to the expiration date of the Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period,
then the Initial Statement, the Initial Working Capital, the Initial Net
Indebtedness and the Initial Swap Termination Costs set forth in the Initial
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers' Representative and
shall become final and binding upon the Seller Parties and Buyer in accordance
with the last sentence of Section 2.4(f).

  

  

(e) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement (the "Purchase Price Adjustment
Consultation Period"), Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall seek to resolve
any disagreement that they may have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement.

  

  

(f) If, at the end of the Purchase Price Adjustment Consultation Period,
Sellers' Representative and Buyer have been unable to resolve all
disagreements that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement, then Sellers' Representative
and Buyer promptly thereafter shall submit all matters that remain in dispute
with respect to the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement (along
with a copy of the Initial Statement marked to indicate those line items that
are in dispute) to KPMG LLP (the "Independent Accountant"); provided that the
scope of the disputes to be submitted to the Independent Accountant shall be
limited to (i) whether the Initial Statement, the Initial Working Capital, the
Initial Net Indebtedness and/or the Initial Swap Termination Costs, as
applicable, were prepared in accordance with this Section 2.4 or (ii) whether
there were mathematical errors in the Initial Statement, as applicable. In the
event that KPMG LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Independent
Accountant, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall cooperate to appoint an
independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of national
recognition mutually agreeable to Sellers' Representative and Buyer, in which
event "Independent Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days
after the submission of such matters to the Independent Accountant, or as soon
as practicable thereafter, the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination in writing, binding on
the Seller Parties and Buyer in accordance with this Section 2.4, of the
appropriate amount of each of the matters that remain in dispute with respect
to the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement. With respect to each
disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position
of either Sellers' Representative or Buyer, shall not be in excess of the
higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Sellers'
Representative in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement or
Buyer in the Initial Statement with respect to such disputed line item. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not review any line
items or make any determination with respect to any matter other than those
matters in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement that remain in
dispute. The statement of the Working Capital, Net Indebtedness and Swap
Termination Costs on the Closing Date and the determination of the Working
Capital, Net Indebtedness and Swap Termination Costs therefrom that are final
and binding on the Seller Parties and Buyer, as determined either through
agreement of Sellers' Representative and Buyer (deemed or otherwise) pursuant
to Sections 2.4(b), (d) and (f) or through the determination of the
Independent Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.4(f), are referred to herein
as the "Final Statement", the "Final Working Capital", the "Final Net
Indebtedness" and the "Final Swap Termination Costs".

by the Independent Accountant, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall each
make available to the Independent Accountant such individuals and such
information, books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by
the Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations under Section 2.4(f);
provided, however, that the independent accountants of the Seller Parties or
Buyer shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the
Independent Accountant unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed
a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such
access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants.

plus

Swap Termination Costs minus (B) the Final Swap Termination Costs, (for the
avoidance of doubt, a negative number shall be deemed to be lesser than a
positive number or zero); minus

Swap Termination Costs exceed the Swap Termination Costs Threshold,

the Companies. The Seller Parties shall be bound by all actions taken and
documents executed by Sellers' Representative in connection with each
Designated Purpose, and Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any action or
decision of Sellers' Representative. Notices or communications to or from
Sellers' Representative shall constitute notice to or from each and all Seller

Representative is coupled with an interest and all authority hereby conferred
is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated or affected by
subsequent disability or incapacity of any Seller Party or by any act of any
Seller Party or by operation of law, whether by such person's death (unless
Sellers' Representative has actual knowledge of such person's death),
disability, protective supervision or any other event. Each Seller Party shall
be deemed to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to
contest, negate or disaffirm the action of Sellers' Representative taken in
good faith under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Notwithstanding

the same directly.

Representative and the other Seller Parties. If Sellers' Representative (x) is
removed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence or (y) advises
the Seller Parties that it is unavailable to perform its duties hereunder,

shall be appointed by the affirmative vote of the Seller Parties representing
a majority in interest of the Shares as of such time (or if such time is at or
after the Closing, by the Seller Parties whose aggregate Pro Rata Share
exceeds 50%). If any successor Sellers' Representative is appointed under this
Section 2.5(c), such appointment shall be effective upon the later of (x)
delivery of written notice thereof, executed by the Seller Parties
representing a majority in interest of the Shares as of such time (or if such
time is at or after the Closing, by the Seller Parties whose aggregate Pro
Rata Share exceeds 50%), to each of such successor Sellers' Representative,
the other Seller Parties and Buyer and (y) delivery by such successor Sellers'
Representative to each party hereof of a written acknowledgement agreeing to

this Section 2.5. Any successor Sellers' Representative appointed in
accordance with this Section 2.5(c) shall be deemed to be Sellers'
Representative for purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and

(b) During the forty-five (45) days immediately following Buyer's receipt of
the Initial Unfunded Liability Statement (the "Unfunded Liability Adjustment
Review Period"), Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted reasonable
access during normal business hours to review Sellers' Representative working
papers and any working papers of Seller Representative's independent
accountants or actuaries relating to the preparation of the Initial Unfunded
Liability Statement and the calculation of the Initial Unfunded Liability, as
well as all of the relevant Books and Records that it possesses and Sellers'
Representative shall make reasonably available to Buyer the individuals
responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the
preparation or calculation of, the Initial Unfunded Liability Statement and
the Initial Unfunded Liability; provided, however, that the independent
accountants and actuaries of Sellers' Representative shall not be obligated to
make any working papers available to Buyer unless and until Buyer has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants and actuaries.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall, following the Closing through the date that the Final
Unfunded Liability Statement becomes such in accordance with the last sentence
of Section 2.11(f), take all actions reasonably necessary or desirable to
maintain and preserve all accounting or actuarial Books and Records, policies
and procedures on which the Initial Unfunded Liability Statement is based or
on which the Final Unfunded Liability Statement is to be based so as not to
materially impede or delay the determination of the Initial Unfunded Liability
or the Final Unfunded Liability or the preparation of the Notice of Unfunded
Liability Adjustment Disagreement or the Final Unfunded Liability Statement in
the manner and utilizing the methods permitted by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Buyer shall notify Sellers' Representative in writing (the "Notice of
Unfunded Liability Adjustment Disagreement") on or prior to the expiration of
the Unfunded Liability Adjustment Review Period if Buyer disagrees with the
amount of the Initial Unfunded Liability included in the Initial Unfunded
Liability Statement and/or disagrees with the preparation of the Initial
Unfunded Liability Statement. The Notice of Unfunded Liability Adjustment
Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement, the amounts involved and Buyer's determination of the amount of
the Initial Unfunded Liability. If no Notice of Unfunded Liability Adjustment
Disagreement is received by Sellers' Representative on or prior to the
expiration date of the Unfunded Liability Adjustment Review Period, then the
Initial Unfunded Liability Statement and the Initial Unfunded Liability set
forth in the Initial Unfunded Liability Statement shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Buyer and shall become final and binding upon the Seller
Parties and Buyer in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.11(f).

  

  

(e) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice

(f) If, at the end of the Unfunded Liability Adjustment Consultation Period,
Sellers' Representative and Buyer have been unable to resolve all
disagreements that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Unfunded Liability Adjustment Disagreement, then Sellers'
Representative and Buyer promptly thereafter shall submit all matters that
remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Unfunded Liability Adjustment
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Unfunded Liability Statement
marked to indicate those items that are in dispute) to an independent actuary
upon which the Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall mutually agree (the
"Independent Actuary"); provided that the scope of the disputes to be
submitted to the Independent Actuary shall be limited to (i) whether the
Initial Unfunded Liability Statement and/or the Initial Unfunded Liability, as
applicable, were prepared in accordance with this Section 2.11 or (ii) whether
there were mathematical errors in the Initial Unfunded Liability Statement, as
applicable. Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such matters to
the Independent Actuary, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent
Actuary, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final
determination in writing, binding on the Seller Parties and Buyer in
accordance with this Section 2.11(f), of the appropriate amount of Unfunded
Liability as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date. Such determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either Sellers' Representative or Buyer, shall
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amount of the
Initial Unfunded Liability advocated by Buyer in the Notice of Unfunded
Liability Adjustment Disagreement or Sellers' Representative in the Initial
Unfunded Liability Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent
Actuary shall not make any determination with respect to any matter other than
those matters in the Notice of Unfunded Liability Adjustment Disagreement that
remain in dispute. The statement of the Unfunded Liability on the Closing Date
and the determination of the Unfunded Liability therefrom that are final and
binding on the Seller Parties and Buyer, as determined either through
agreement of Sellers' Representative and Buyer (deemed or otherwise) pursuant
to Sections 2.11 (d) and (f) or through the determination of the Independent
Actuary pursuant to this Section 2.11(f), are referred to herein as the "Final
Unfunded Liability Statement" and the "Final Unfunded Liability",
respectively.

  

  

(g) The cost of the Independent Actuary's review and determination shall be
shared equally by the Seller Parties, on the one hand (allocated among them in
accordance with Section 2.10), and Buyer, on the other hand. During the review
by the Independent Actuary, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall each make
available to the Independent Actuary such individuals and such information,
books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the
Independent Actuary to fulfill its obligations under Section 2.11(f);
provided, however, that the accountants, actuaries, advisors and other
representatives of the Seller Parties or Buyer shall not be obligated to make
any working papers available to the Independent Actuary unless and until the
Independent Actuary has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants, actuaries, advisors and other
representatives.

  

  

(h) The "Post-Closing Unfunded Liability Adjustment" shall be the amount equal
to:

  

  

(x) if an Interim Unfunded Liability Adjustment was made, the lesser of (i)
the Interim Unfunded Liability Adjustment and (ii) the product of (A) 0.65
multiplied by (B) (1) the Estimated Unfunded Liability minus (2) the Final
Unfunded Liability (for the avoidance of doubt, a negative number shall be
deemed to be lesser than a positive number);

Table of Contents

 

 

  

  

  

(y) if an Interim Unfunded Liability Adjustment was not made and the Final
Unfunded Liability exceeds the Unfunded Liability Threshold, the product of 
 (i) 0.65 multiplied by (ii)(A) the Unfunded Liability Threshold minus (B)
the Final Unfunded Liability; and

  

  

(z) if an Interim Unfunded Liability Adjustment was not made and the Unfunded
Liability Threshold exceeds the Final Unfunded Liability, zero (0).

  

  

If the Post-Closing Unfunded Liability Adjustment is a positive amount, then
Buyer shall pay in cash to the Seller Parties the amount of the Post-Closing
Unfunded Liability Adjustment (each Seller Party being entitled to receive a
portion of such amount in accordance with Section 2.10). Any such payment by
Buyer shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Sellers' Representative, as agent for the Seller
Parties, within two (2) Business Days after the Final Unfunded Liability
Statement becomes such, together with interest thereon, from the Closing Date
through the date on which the Post-Closing Unfunded Liability Adjustment is
paid, at the Interest Rate calculated and payable in accordance with Section
2.9. If the Post-Closing Unfunded Liability Adjustment is a negative amount,
then within two (2) Business Days after the Final Unfunded Liability Statement
becomes such, the Seller Parties shall pay in cash to Buyer the amount equal
to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Unfunded Liability Adjustment
(together with interest thereon, from the Closing Date through the date on
which the Post-Closing Unfunded Liability Adjustment is paid, at the Interest
Rate calculated and payable in accordance with Section 2.9). Any such payment
by the Seller Parties shall be allocated among them in accordance with Section
2.10 and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account (or accounts) designated by Buyer within five (5) Business Days after
the Final Unfunded Liability Statement becomes such.

  

  

Section 2.12 Adjustment to Payment at Closing for Change in Control Payment.

  

  

(a) Within one-hundred and ninety (190) days following the Closing Date,
Sellers' Representative shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement
(the "Initial Change in Control Payment Statement") calculating and setting
forth the Change in Control Payment (the Change in Control Payment amount
calculated and set forth on such Change in Control Statement, the "Initial
Change in Control Payment"), which statement shall include a worksheet setting
forth in reasonable detail how such amount was calculated. If Sellers'
Representative does not deliver the Initial Change in Control Payment
Statement to Buyer within one-hundred and ninety (190) days following the
Closing Date, then Buyer may prepare and present the Initial Change in Control
Payment Statement within an additional ninety (90) days thereafter. If Buyer
elects to prepare the Initial Change in Control Payment Statement in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, all references in Section
2.12 (b), (d) and (f) to Buyer and Sellers' Representative, respectively,
shall be deemed to be references to Sellers' Representative and Buyer,
respectively.

(b) During the forty-five (45) days immediately following Buyer's receipt of
the Initial Change in Control Payment Statement (the "Change in Control
Payment Adjustment Review Period"), Buyer and its representatives shall be
permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to review Sellers'
Representative's working papers and any working papers of Sellers'
Representative's independent accountants relating to the preparation of the
Initial Change in Control Payment Statement and the calculation of the Initial
Change in Control Payment, as well as all of the relevant Books and Records
that it possesses and Sellers' Representative shall make reasonably available
to Buyer the individuals responsible for and knowledgeable about the
information used in, and the preparation or calculation of, the Initial Change
in Control Payment Statement and the Initial Change in Control Payment;
provided, however, that the independent accountants of Sellers' Representative
shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to Buyer unless
and until Buyer has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall, following the Closing through the date that the Final Change
in Control Payment Statement becomes such in accordance with the last sentence
of Section 2.12(f), take all actions reasonably necessary or desirable to
maintain and preserve all accounting Books and Records, policies and
procedures on which the Initial Change in Control Payment Statement is based
or on which the Final Change in Control Payment Statement is to be based so as
not to materially impede or delay the determination of the Initial Change in
Control Payment or the Final Change in Control Payment or the preparation of
the Notice of Change in Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement or the Final
Change in Control Payment Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods
permitted by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Buyer shall notify Sellers' Representative in writing (the "Notice of
Change in Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement") on or prior to the
expiration of the Change in Control Payment Adjustment Review Period if Buyer
disagrees with the amount of the Initial Change in Control Payment included in
the Initial Change in Control Payment Statement and/or disagrees with the
preparation of the Initial Change in Control Payment Statement. The Notice of
Change in Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and
Buyer's determination of the amount of the Initial Change in Control Payment.
If no Notice of Change in Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement is received
by Sellers' Representative on or prior to the expiration date of the Change in
Control Payment Adjustment Review Period, then the Initial Change in Control
Payment Statement and the Initial Change in Control Payment set forth in the
Initial Change in Control Payment Statement shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Buyer and shall become final and binding upon the Seller
Parties and Buyer in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.12(f).

  

  

(e) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Change in Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement (the "Change in Control
Payment Adjustment Consultation Period"), Sellers' Representative and Buyer
shall seek to resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Change in Control Payment Adjustment
Disagreement.

(f) If, at the end of the Change in Control Payment Adjustment Consultation
Period, Sellers' Representative and Buyer have been unable to resolve all
disagreements that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Change in Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement, then Sellers'
Representative and Buyer promptly thereafter shall submit all matters that
remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Change in Control Payment
Adjustment Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Change in Control
Payment Statement marked to indicate those line items that are in dispute) to
the Independent Accountant; provided that the scope of the disputes to be
submitted to the Independent Accountant shall be limited to (i) whether the
Initial Change in Control Payment was prepared in accordance with this Section
2.12 or (ii) whether there were mathematical errors in the Initial Change in
Control Payment Statement, as applicable. In the event that KPMG LLP refuses
or is otherwise unable to act as the Independent Accountant, Sellers'
Representative and Buyer shall cooperate to appoint an independent certified
public accounting firm in the United States of national recognition mutually
agreeable to Sellers' Representative and Buyer, in which event "Independent
Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the submission
of such matters to the Independent Accountant, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, will make a final determination in writing, binding on the Seller
Parties and Buyer in accordance with this Section 2.12, of the appropriate
amount of Change in Control Payment. With respect to each disputed line item,
such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Sellers'
Representative or Buyer, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than
the lower, of the amounts advocated by Buyer in the Notice of Change in
Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement or Sellers' Representative in the
Initial Change in Control Payment Statement with respect to such disputed line
item. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not make
any determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the
Notice of Change in Control Payment Adjustment Disagreement that remain in
dispute. The statement of the Change in Control Payment and the determination
of the Change in Control Payment therefrom that are final and binding on the
Seller Parties and Buyer, as determined either through agreement of Sellers'
Representative and Buyer (deemed or otherwise) pursuant to Sections 2.12 (d)
and (f) or through the determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant to
this Section 2.12(f), are referred to herein as the "Final Change in Control
Payment Statement" and the "Final Change in Control Payment", respectively.

  

  

(g) The cost of the Independent Accountant's review and determination shall be
shared equally by the Seller Parties, on the one hand (allocated among them in
accordance with Section 2.10), and Buyer, on the other hand. During the review
by the Independent Accountant, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall each
make available to the Independent Accountant such individuals and such
information, books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by
the Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations under Section 2.12(f);
provided, however, that the accountants, actuaries, advisors and other
representatives of the Seller Parties or Buyer shall not be obligated to make
any working papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until
the Independent Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and

amount equal to:

  

  

(x) if an Interim Change in Control Payment Adjustment was made, the lesser of
(i) the Interim Change in Control Payment Adjustment and 
 (ii) (A) the Estimated Change in Control Payment minus (B) the Final Change
in Control Payment (for the avoidance of doubt, a negative number shall be
deemed to be lesser than a positive number or zero);

Final Change in Control Payment exceeds the Change in Control Payment
Threshold, (i) the Change in Control Payment Threshold minus (ii) the Final
Change in Control Payment, and

  

  

(z) if an Interim Change in Control Payment Adjustment was not made and the

If the Post-Closing Change in Control Payment Adjustment is a positive amount,
then Buyer shall pay in cash to the Seller Parties the amount of the Post-
Closing Change in Control Payment Adjustment (each Seller Party being entitled
to receive a portion of such amount in accordance with Section 2.10). Any such
payment by Buyer shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by Sellers' Representative, as agent for the Seller
Parties, within two (2) Business Days after the Final Change in Control

material Liability to the Companies on or at any time after the Closing Date.
Except as otherwise required under applicable Law or, as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in a
material Liability to the Companies on or at any time after the Closing Date,
each Foreign Benefit Plan (including any Foreign Benefit Plan covering
retirees or other former employees) may be amended to reduce benefits or limit
the liability of the Companies or terminated.

  

  

(f) The Companies do not provide, and do not have any material obligations
with respect to, retiree or post-employment health, medical or other welfare
or life insurance benefits under any Benefit Plan, except where the cost
thereof is born entirely by the former Employee (or his or her eligible
dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980(B)(f) of the Code
or any similar statute. The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
under any Benefit Plan that provides retiree or post-employment health,
medical or other welfare or life insurance benefits, based upon the actuarial
assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report
prepared by such Benefit Plan's actuary with respect to such Benefit Plan, did
not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the
assets of such Benefit Plan allocable to such accumulated post-retirement
benefit obligation.

  

  

(g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (whether alone or in conjunction with any other event,
including any termination of employment on or following the Closing Date) (i)
entitle any current or former director, officer, employee, individual
independent contractor or individual consultant of the Companies to any
compensation or any increased benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or result in any payment or funding of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable pursuant to or trigger any other material
obligation under any Benefit Plan, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the
Companies to merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan on or after the
Closing Date.

  

  

(h) No amount, economic benefit or other entitlement that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the
Transactions (whether alone or in conjunction with any other event, including
any termination of employment on or following the Closing Date) by any person
who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) with respect to the Companies could be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No current
or former director, officer, employee, individual independent contractor or
individual consultant of the Companies is entitled to any gross-up, make-whole
or other additional payment in respect of any Tax (including, without
limitation, Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code) imposed on
such Person or interest or penalty related thereto.

Buyer, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., The Bank of Nova Scotia, Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Bank of America, N.A. and U.S. Bank
National Association (together with the annexes thereto, the "Financing
Commitment"), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed,
subject to the terms thereof, to lend the debt amounts set forth therein (the
"Buyer Financing").

  

  

(c) The Financing Commitment is (i) a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto and
(ii) enforceable in accordance with its terms against Buyer, and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto, in each case, subject
to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Financing Commitment has
not been amended or modified, except as consistent with Section 5.12(c), and
as of the date hereof the respective obligations and commitments contained in

(d) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Buyer Financing, other than as set forth in
or contemplated by the Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (x) constitute a
default or breach on the part of Buyer or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any
other parties thereto, under the Financing Commitment or (y) constitute or
result in a failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth in the
Financing Commitment assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.

  

  

(e) Except for a fee letter relating to fees with respect to the Buyer
Financing (complete and correct copies of which have been provided to the
Seller Parties, with only fee amounts and fee percentages and certain economic
terms of the market flex (none of which would adversely affect the amount or
availability of the Buyer Financing) redacted), there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Buyer Financing other than
as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment and delivered to the Seller
Parties prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, Buyer has fully paid,
or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment or other fees which are due
and payable with respect to the Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof,
assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2, Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Buyer Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment will not be satisfied
or that the Buyer Financing will not be made available to Buyer on or prior to
the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 4.11 Solvency. Immediately following the Closing and after giving
effect to the Transactions, including the Buyer Financing and the payment of
the Purchase Price, the repayment or refinancing of all indebtedness of Buyer
and the Companies to the extent such repayment or refinancing is required in
connection with the Transactions and the payment of all amounts required to be
paid in connection with the Transactions and all related fees and expenses,
Buyer and the subsidiaries of Buyer including the Companies, on a consolidated
basis, will be Solvent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent"
when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date,
including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other liabilities" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash to meet its obligations
as they become due.

  

  

Section 4.12 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates, nor any of their respective stockholders, trustees,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, members, fiduciaries,
agents or representatives, nor any other Person has made or is making any
other representation or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or
written, express or implied, with respect to Buyer, its Affiliates, their
respective businesses, this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
Transactions. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and other than for fraud, (a) Buyer disclaims, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, any other representations or warranties, whether made by
Buyer, any of its Affiliates, any of their respective stockholders, trustees,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, members, fiduciaries,
agents or representatives or any other Person and (b) Buyer disclaims, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, all Liability and responsibility for any
other representation, warranty, opinion, projection, forecast, advice,
statement or information made, communicated or furnished (orally or in
writing) to the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates.

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of any such contractual
confidentiality obligations if requested by Buyer), upon reasonable prior
notice, the Seller Parties shall (i) afford Buyer, and its representatives,
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Books and Records,
Contracts, Governmental Authorizations and the offices and properties of the
Companies, (ii) furnish to Buyer such additional financial data and other
information regarding the Companies as Buyer may from time to time reasonably
request and (iii) make reasonably available to Buyer the Employees ; provided,
however, that the reasonableness of such access and requests shall be
determined by taking into account, among other considerations, the competitive
positions of the parties; provided, further, that such investigation shall (i)
be under the supervision of the Seller Parties' designated personnel or
representatives and (ii) be in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere
with any of the businesses or operations of the Seller Parties or their
respective Affiliates (including the Companies); provided, further, that all
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) shall be
directed to such Person or Persons as may be designated by Sellers'
Representative, and Buyer shall not directly or indirectly contact any
officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the Seller Parties,
any Company or any of their respective Affiliates without the prior approval
of such designated Person(s); and provided, further, that the auditors and
independent accountants of the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates
(including the Companies) shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to any Person unless and until such Person has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or
independent accountants. If so reasonably requested by the Seller Parties,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (as applicable) to, enter into a
customary joint defense agreement with the Seller Parties or their respective
Affiliates with respect to any information to be provided to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 5.1(a). Buyer shall reimburse the Seller Parties promptly for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Seller Parties and their

confidentiality obligations, upon reasonable prior notice, Buyer shall (i)
afford the Seller Parties and their respective representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the Books and Records relating to any
period prior to the Closing and reasonably related to such matter (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns and other information and documents
relating to Tax matters) and (ii) make available to the Seller Parties the
employees of Buyer and the Companies whose assistance and expertise is
reasonably necessary to assist the Seller Parties or their respective
Affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the Seller
Parties' or such Affiliates' inquiries for any of the purposes referred to in
this Section 5.1(b) above; provided, however, that such investigation shall
not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates; and provided, further, that the auditors and independent
accountants of Buyer or its Affiliates shall not be obligated to make any work
papers available to any Person unless and until such Person has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or
independent accountants. If so reasonably requested by Buyer, the Seller
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (as applicable) to,
enter into a customary joint defense agreement with any one or more of Buyer
and its Affiliates with respect to any information to be provided to the
Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.1(b).
The Seller Party making a request to Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
accordance with this Section 5.1(b) shall reimburse Buyer promptly for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in
complying with such request by or on behalf of such Seller Party or its
Affiliates in connection with this Section 5.1(b). In the case of a request in
connection with this Section 5.1(b) made by multiple Seller Parties, such
Seller Parties shall be responsible for such reimbursement costs, jointly and
severally, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares.

Antitrust Entity of non-privileged information, documents or testimony
requested by such Government Antitrust Entity that are reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions; (ii) the use
of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination or judgment of a Governmental Entity
that would , restrain, prevent, enjoin, materially delay or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Transactions, including (A) the defense through litigation
on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding
by any Person, including any Government Antitrust Entity, seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Transactions, (B) subject to Section 5.3(d), the agreement by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to take such other actions, and to effect such other actions

action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent,
eliminate or remove the actual or threatened (x) commencement of any
proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance of any order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment that would , restrain, prevent, enjoin, materially
delay or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions by any Government
Antitrust Entity; and (iii) the use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in
the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any such proceeding or
inquiry that would make consummation of the Transactions in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement unlawful or that would
restrain, prevent, enjoin, materially delay or otherwise prohibit consummation
of the Transactions, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the
posting of a bond or, in the case of Buyer, the taking of the steps
contemplated by clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(c)) necessary to resist,
vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual or
threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as promptly as reasonably
practicable. In no event shall any Seller Party be required to agree to any
condition, restriction, divestiture or other requirement imposed on such
Seller Party and its Affiliates (other than the Companies).

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall obligate Buyer or any Seller Party to
agree to any divestitures or other remedy not conditioned on the occurrence of
the Closing and none of the Seller Parties shall, and each shall cause the
Companies not to, agree to or effect any divesture or other remedy without the
prior written consent of Buyer. The parties hereto also agree that neither
this Section 5.3 nor any other provision in this Agreement shall require Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, in order to obtain any approvals or the expiration
of waiting periods under applicable Antitrust Laws, any Seller Required
Approval, any Buyer Required Approvals or otherwise, to (i) sell, lease,
license or otherwise dispose of or hold separate pending such disposition, any
assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or businesses or
other operations or interests of Buyer or the Companies, or any of their
respective Affiliates, or propose, negotiate, offer to effect, or consent or
commit to take any of the foregoing actions, or (ii) take or agree to take any
other action or agree or consent to any mitigation, limitations or
restrictions on the freedom of actions with respect to, or the ability to
retain or keep ownership interests in, or make changes in, any such assets,
rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other
operations or interests of Buyer or the Companies, or any of their respective
Affiliates if, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), any such sale, lease,
license, disposition, hold separate, action, mitigation, limitation,
restriction or change would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operation of
Buyer and its subsidiaries (assuming that the Companies are subsidiaries of
Buyer), taken as a whole (it being understood that, for this purpose, such an
adverse effect on Buyer and its subsidiaries (assuming the Companies are
subsidiaries of Buyer) shall be material if such an adverse effect would be
material only to the financial condition, assets, business or results of
operations of the Companies, taken as a whole, rather than that of Buyer and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (such a material adverse effect being
referred to as a "Material Detriment"). For purposes of determining whether a
Material Detriment would occur, (x) the actions, restrictions or conditions
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 5.3(d) and (y) any proceeds,
rights or other benefits obtained by the Companies or Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries as a result of any such actions, restrictions or conditions shall
be taken into account.

(e) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Seller Parties and Buyer shall promptly notify each other of any
communication any of them receives from any Government Entity and permit the
other parties to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to
any Government Entity and shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between such party or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Government Entity or members of the
staff of any Government Entity, on the other hand, in each case to the extent
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Each of Buyer and the Seller Parties shall not agree to
participate in any meeting with any Government Entity relating to the matters

participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Seller Parties and Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing (including in
seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
require any party or any of their respective Affiliates (i) to disclose any
information that in the reasonable judgment of such party or any of their
respective Affiliates (as the case may be) would result in the disclosure of
any Trade Secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality, or (ii) to disclose any privileged information or
confidential competitive information of such party or any of their respective

participate to take into account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan) and levels of benefits thereunder, the pre-Closing service of such
Employees with the Companies (including any predecessors thereto) as if such
service were with Buyer to the same extent that such service was recognized by
the Companies immediately prior to the Closing under the comparable Benefit
Plan; provided, that such crediting of service does not result in any
duplication of benefits.

credit for any co-payments, deductibles paid and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred, during the portion of the plan year under a corresponding provision

Financing prior to the Closing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by any
Seller Party, reimburse the Seller Parties for all costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the Seller Parties or their

connection therewith (other than historical information related to the
Companies provided to Buyer in writing by the Seller Parties or the Companies
specifically for use in the Buyer Financing offering materials), and this
indemnification shall survive termination of this Agreement. All non-public
information regarding the Seller Parties and their respective Affiliates

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Buyer Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitment and, if
applicable, any definitive agreement relating to the Buyer Financing as
promptly as reasonably practicable, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitment on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained therein, (ii) negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Financing
Commitment or on other terms that would not (x) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Buyer Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount of the Buyer Financing) or (y) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to
the receipt of the Buyer Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (II) make the funding of
the Buyer Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Buyer
Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Buyer
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of Buyer to
consummate the Transactions or the likelihood of consummation of the
Transactions, (iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Buyer in such definitive agreements that are within
its control, and (iv) comply with (or obtain the waiver thereof) its
obligations under the Financing Commitment and the definitive agreements with
respect thereto. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
lenders and the other persons providing such Buyer Financing to fund the Buyer
Financing required to consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date, which
efforts shall include, in the event that all conditions in the Financing
Commitment have been satisfied or, upon funding, will be satisfied, litigation
or other enforcement action by Buyer to cause such lenders and other persons
to provide such Buyer Financing. In the event any portion of the Buyer
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex
portions) contemplated in the Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller
Parties and, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from
the same or alternative sources on terms and conditions not less favorable,
taken as a whole, to Buyer (taking into account the flex provisions as set
forth in the Financing Commitment), in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as possible. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
agree that the Seller Parties shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain any
alternative financing in the manner set forth in Section 5.12(a).

  

  

(c) Buyer shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other material provision under the Financing
Commitment (other than in accordance with the flex portions thereof) or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto without the consent of Sellers'
Representative if such amendments, modifications or waivers would (x) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Buyer Financing (including by changing the amount
of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Buyer Financing) or (y)
impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
conditions, to the receipt of the Buyer Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (II) make the
funding of the Buyer Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Buyer Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the
ability of Buyer to consummate the Transactions or the likelihood of
consummation of the Transactions. Promptly after entering into any such
amendment, Buyer shall provide the Seller Parties with a copy of such executed
amendment.

reasonable detail of the status of its endeavors to arrange the Buyer
Financing and shall provide to the Seller Parties copies of all executed final
definitive documents related to the Buyer Financing (other than fee letters).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give the Seller
Parties prompt notice: (i) if Buyer becomes aware of any breach or default (or
any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any
party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the
Buyer Financing; (ii) of the receipt by it of any notice or other written
communication from any person with respect to any: (A) actual or alleged
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing
Commitment or any definitive document related to the Buyer Financing or any
provisions of the Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to
the Buyer Financing or (B) dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the
Buyer Financing; and (iii) if Buyer becomes aware of any event or circumstance
that would reasonably be expected to cause Buyer to be unable to obtain all or
any portion of the Buyer Financing on the terms (including the flex portions
thereof), in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitment or any definitive documents related to the Buyer Financing.

the termination of their appointment or under, in connection with, arising out
of, resulting from or in any way related to this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement, the Transactions or the sale process leading up to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and the Transactions,
or otherwise.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without consent of
Sellers' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), amend, restate or repeal the indemnification and
limitation of liability provisions of any Organizational Documents of any
Company within six (6) years after the Closing in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were officers and
directors of such Company (in each case, when acting in such capacity) prior
to or as of the Closing, unless such Organizational Document amendment,
restatement or repeal is required by applicable Law.

each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or such Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

  

  

(d) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing
each of the present and former directors and officers identified in Section
5.13(a) shall be an express third party beneficiary of this Section 5.13. The
rights of such directors and officers under this Section 5.13 shall be in
addition to any rights such directors and officers may have under the

or Laws.

execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such
documents and other instruments and shall take, or shall cause to be taken,
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the
Transactions, (b) shall refrain from taking any actions that could reasonably
be expected to impair, delay or impede the Closing and (c) not in limitation
of any other provision of this Agreement, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause all the conditions to the obligations of the
other party hereto to consummate the Transactions to be met as soon as
reasonably practicable.

  

  

Section 5.15 Company Incentive Units. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller Parties (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Long-Term Incentive Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be reasonably required to provide that (A) each Company
Incentive Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date
shall be deemed exercised by the holder thereof as of the Closing Date and
settled for a cash payment in an amount which shall be determined in the sole
discretion of the Seller Parties in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Long-Term Incentive Plan, and (B) the amounts payable under clause
(A) to a holder of such Company Incentive Units shall be paid, without
interest, within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date except as may be (x)
otherwise required under the applicable Long-Term Incentive Plan, (y)
otherwise required under a payment election made by an individual award holder
in respect of such Company Incentive Units or (z) necessary to avoid the
imposition of any additional taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the
Code.

  

  

Section 5.16 Section 280G Matters. To the extent necessary to avoid the
application of Section 280G of the Code and the applicable final Treasury
regulations and rulings thereunder, prior to the Closing, the Seller Parties
shall cause the Companies, with respect to such payments or benefits that are
reasonably likely to, separately or in the aggregate, without regard to the
measures described herein, constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning
of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the applicable final Treasury
regulations and rulings thereunder ("Section 280G Payments"), to use
reasonable best efforts to conduct a vote satisfying the requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the applicable final Treasury regulations
and rulings thereunder, including reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers,
from any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) such that if such vote is successful then no portion of the Section
280G Payments will constitute a "parachute payment" and such that the
deduction of such Section 280G Payments will not be limited by the application
of Section 280G(a) of the Code and the applicable final Treasury regulations
and rulings thereunder. The Seller Parties shall cause the Companies to
forward to Buyer, and allow Buyer to review and comment upon, prior to
submission to the stockholders of the applicable Company, copies of all
material documents prepared for purposes of complying with this Section 5.16
and shall consider any such comments in good faith. The Seller Parties shall
indemnify Buyer for any deductions disallowed pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code and the applicable final Treasury regulations and rulings thereunder. The
value of any deductions indemnifiable hereunder shall be calculated assuming a
35% tax rate.

5.5(a), exceed the Purchase Price (as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section
2.4).

(j) The rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to
the provisions of Section 7.2, and the rights of Seller Indemnified Parties to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.3, after the Closing
shall not be affected by any knowledge at or prior to the execution of this
Agreement or at or prior to the Closing of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, whether such knowledge came from Buyer, the
Seller Parties, the Companies or any other Person, or any waiver of Section
6.2 or Section 6.3.

  

  

Section 7.5 Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying
party (an "Indemnifying Party") may have liability to any Indemnified Party
hereunder, other than those relating to Taxes (which are governed, subject to
Section 5.5(d), by Section 5.5), is asserted against or sought to be collected
from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days
following such Indemnified Party's receipt of a Third Party Claim, notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third
Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time
constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other
material details pertaining thereto (a "Claim Notice"); provided, that the
failure to provide such notice in a timely manner shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its indemnification obligations under this
Article VII (i) except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
by such failure and (ii) except to the extent of the Indemnified Party's
expenses that are incurred during the period in which timely notice was not
provided. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days (or such lesser
number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court
proceedings in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires
to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim provided that
the Indemnifying Party may only elect to defend the Indemnified Party and
assume direction and control of such defense if (i) the Third Party Claim does
not seek an order, injunction or other equitable relief that if granted would
be material to the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not
have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of outside counsel, that
representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party would
be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them
and (iii) the Indemnifying Party actively and diligently defends in good faith
such Third Party Claim and keeps the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of
the progress of such Third Party Claim; provided, further, that, from the date
of such notice electing to assume the conduct and control of the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party, regardless of whether it is
otherwise required to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect
to such Third Party Claim, shall be responsible for the costs and fees of such
Indemnified Party's attorneys and related litigation expenses incurred by it
in connection with such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party validly notifies the Indemnified
Party within the Notice Period that it shall assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and
shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense at its expense;
provided, that once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel
of its choosing. The Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense
at its expense unless (i) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded, based on the advice of outside counsel, that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have
authorized the Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the
Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with
the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or discharge, or admit
any liability with respect to, any such Third Party Claim unless the relief
consists solely of money Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party and
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person(s)
asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release
from all liability with respect to such claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; it
being understood that the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a
Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim, including by
providing access to each other's relevant business records and other
documents, and employees.

  

  

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

  

  

(f) Sellers' Representative shall act on behalf of the Seller Parties and the
Seller Indemnified Parties for purposes of this Section 7.5 for any Third
Party Claim that is the subject of the indemnification provisions of this
Section 7.5.

  

  

Section 7.6 Payments. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this Article VII, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with
all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for a Loss that is
the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in
good faith disputes the Loss, in which event it shall so notify the
Indemnified Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount
of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than thirty (30) days
following any final determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Party's
liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (i) the parties
to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment,
or (iii) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-
appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to
submit thereto.

Section 7.7 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All payments made by
an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant
to Section 5.5(a), Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 hereof shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  

  

Section 7.8 Adjustments to Losses.

  

  

(a) Insurance. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against
any other Person, net of any actual costs or expenses incurred in connection
with securing or obtaining such proceeds shall be deducted. In the event that
an Indemnified Party has any rights against a third party with respect to any
occurrence, claim or loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party
under this Article VII, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to such
rights to the extent of such payment; provided that until the Indemnified
Party recovers full payment of the Loss, any and all claims of the
Indemnifying Party against any such third party on account of said indemnity
payment is hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment
to the Indemnified Party's rights against such third party. Without limiting
the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party
and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination
rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such
claims.

  

  

(b) Purchase Price Adjustment. In calculating the amount of any Loss for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the amount of any reserve or
other negative provision related to such Loss shall be deducted to the extent
reflected in the Final Statement and taken into account for any adjustment to
the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.3, Section 2.4, Section 2.11
or Section 2.12.

  

  

(c) Taxes. In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted an
amount equal to any Tax benefit (including the utilization of a Tax loss or
Tax credit carried forward) actually realized by the Indemnified Party and
calculated by determining the difference in the Tax liability of the
Indemnified Party "with and without" such Loss.

  

  

(d) Reimbursement. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the amount, if any, by which (i) the sum of (A) the
amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party in respect of
such Loss plus (B) the amount received from the third party in respect
thereof, exceeds (ii) the full amount of the Loss.

Section 7.9 Remedies. Except in the case of fraud and as otherwise provided in
Section 9.9, the rights and remedies under this Article VII, Schedule 5.19,
or, in the case of Taxes, Section 5.5, are exclusive and in lieu of any and
all other rights and remedies that the Seller Parties and Buyer may have under
this Agreement or otherwise against each other with respect to any breach of
any representation or warranty or any failure to perform any covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement, the Companies, the Business and the
Shares, in each case, and each of the Seller Parties and Buyer expressly
waives any and all other rights, remedies and causes of action it or its
Affiliates may have against any other party or its Affiliates now or in the
future under any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (which for this purpose shall exclude the transactions contemplated
by the Ancillary Agreements). Except in the case of fraud, the remedies
expressly provided in this Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive
basis for and means of recourse between the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which for this purpose shall
exclude the transactions contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements).

  

  

Section 7.10 Gross-Up. All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an
Indemnified Party in respect of a claim pursuant to Section 5.5(a), Section
7.2 or Section 7.3 hereof shall include any amount necessary to hold the
Indemnified Party harmless on an after-tax basis from all Taxes, if any,
required to be paid or the Tax costs incurred as a result of receiving such
payment (including the payment of any gross-up determined herein by such
Indemnified Party or any consolidated group of which such Indemnified Party is
a member). The amount of any Taxes under this Section 7.10 shall be the actual
tax cost to the Indemnified Party determined by calculating the difference in
the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party "with and without" such payment.

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Seller Parties and Buyer;

  

  

(b) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller Parties, on the other
hand, by giving written notice of such termination to the other party, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to November 30, 2011 (the "Outside
Date"); provided further, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party hereto whose
failure to fulfill any of such party's obligations under or comply with the
terms of this Agreement has primarily caused or resulted in the failure of the
Closing to occur prior to such date; provided, further, that Buyer may not
terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) at any time the Seller
Parties have the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

  

  

(c) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller Parties, on the other
hand, by giving written notice of such termination to the other party, if any
court of competent jurisdiction or a Government Entity shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any party hereto
whose failure to fulfill any of such party's obligations under or comply with
the terms of this Agreement has primarily caused or resulted in such order,
decree, ruling or action;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

Table of Contents

 

 

  

  

  

(d) by the Seller Parties if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or,
if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) calendar days
after written notice thereof is given by the Seller Parties (acting through
Sellers' Representative) to Buyer and (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to the
Outside Date; provided, however, that the Seller Parties are not then in
material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) not to be satisfied; or

  

  

(e) by Buyer if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Seller Parties in this Agreement, or any
such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not
curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30)
calendar days after written notice thereof is given by Buyer to Sellers'
Representative and (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to the Outside Date;
provided, however, that Buyer is not then in material breach of this Agreement
so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.3(a)
or Section 6.3(b) not to be satisfied; or

  

  

(f) by the Seller Parties if (i) the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and
6.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied, (ii) the Seller Parties
shall have irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Buyer that all
conditions set forth in Section 6.3 have been satisfied or that they are
willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 6.3 and (iii) Buyer
fails to consummate the Transactions within ten (10) Business Days following
the date on which the Seller Parties deliver the written notice referred to in
clause (ii) of this Section 8.1(f); provided that, (x) no party shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement during the eleven (11) Business Days
following the delivery by the Seller Parties of the written notice referred to
in clause (ii) of this Section 8.1(f) and (y) beginning on and after the
fourth (4th) Business Day following the date on which the Seller Parties
deliver the written notice referred to in clause (ii) of this Section 8.1(f),
the representations and warranties of the Seller Parties set forth in clause
(ii) of Section 3.19 shall be deemed to be true and correct in all respects
for all purposes under the Agreement with respect to any Change that occurs or
arises on or after such fourth (4th) Business Day (for the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer and the Seller Parties agree that (A) no Changes that occur or arise
after such fourth (4th) Business Day shall cause the representations and
warranties of the Seller Parties set forth in clause (ii) of Section 3.19 to
not be true and correct in all respects and (B) Buyer shall not be in breach
of Section 2.6 until after such tenth (10th) Business Day).

  

  

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability
to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, or their respective
directors, officers or employees, except for the provisions of, and the
obligations of the parties hereto contained in Section 3.22 (Finders' Fees),
Section 4.7 (Finders' Fees), Section 5.9 (Confidentiality), the expense
reimbursement and indemnification provisions contained in Section 5.12(a)
(Financing), this Section 8.2 and Article IX (and any related definitional
provisions set forth in Article I). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 8.2(a) shall relieve any party from liability for any material
breach of this Agreement that arose prior to such termination.

Table of Contents

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
then Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Sellers'
Representative, as agent for the Seller Parties, for distribution to the
Seller Parties in accordance with Section 2.10 an amount equal to $412,800,000
(the "Buyer Fee") (it being understood that in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay the Buyer Fee on more than one occasion).

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.2 are
an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Seller Parties commence a suit that results in a
judgment against Buyer for the amount set forth in Section 8.2(b), Buyer shall
pay to the Seller Parties their costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the Interest Rate in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made through the date of payment.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Buyer fails
to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.6 (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) or fails to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), in each case, solely as a result of a Financing
Source Breach (and Buyer has complied in all material respects with Section
5.12), then, except for the Seller Parties' right to expense reimbursement and
indemnification from Buyer in accordance with Section 5.12(a) and, if the
court so grants, specific performance in accordance Section 9.9, the Seller
Parties' and their respective Affiliates' sole and exclusive remedy (whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Buyer or any
former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or
assignee of any of the foregoing or any Financing Sources for any breach, loss
or damage shall be to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and
receive payment of the Buyer Fee provided by Section 8.2(b) (plus, in the case
the Buyer Fee, if any, is not timely paid, the amounts described in Section
8.2(c)) and expense reimbursement and indemnification from Buyer in accordance
with Section 5.12(a), and following the receipt of such Buyer Fee (plus, in
the case the Buyer Fee, if any, is not timely paid, the amounts described in
Section 8.2(c)) and such expense reimbursement and indemnification from Buyer
in accordance with Section 5.12(a), none of Buyer or any former, current or
future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general
or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of
the foregoing or any Financing Sources will have any liability or obligation
to the Seller Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory of
law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, while Seller
Parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
Section 9.9 and the payment of the Buyer Fee under Section 8.2(b), under no
circumstances shall Seller Parties be permitted or entitled to receive both
such grant of specific performance and any money damages, including all or any
portion of the Buyer Fee.

Section 9.2 Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement and the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
Buyer and the Seller Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law, except as otherwise
specifically provided in Article VII and Section 8.1(d) hereof.

  

  

Section 9.3 No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No party
to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except as provided in
Sections 2.5 and 9.5, and any attempted or purported assignment in violation
of this Section 9.3 shall be null and void. Except as set forth in the
immediately following sentence, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, the Seller Parties,
Sellers' Representative, the Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) from and after the Closing, each present and former director and officer
of any Company shall be an express third party beneficiary of Section 5.13 and
(ii) the Financing Sources shall be third party beneficiaries of the
provisions of Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(d) and 9.8 (Governing Law; Submission to
Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 8.2(a), 8.2(d), this
Section 9.3 and Section 9.8 (Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction;
Selection of Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury) (and any provisions of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provisions would modify the substance of Section 8.2(a), Section 8.2(d), this
Section 9.3 or Section 9.8 (Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction;
Selection of Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury)) may not be modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

  

  

Section 9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and all Schedules and Exhibits hereto)
and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such
matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect until the Closing.

Section 9.5 Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any
other party under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of
such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by
such party.

  

  

Section 9.6 Public Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein (but subject to the second sentence of this Section 9.6),
from and after the date hereof, no press release or similar public
announcement or communication shall be made or caused to be made relating to
this Agreement unless specifically approved in advance by both parties hereto
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, contained herein, the foregoing
sentence shall not apply to announcements or communications that Buyer
determines in good faith are required to comply with the requirements of any
applicable Law and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which
the securities of Buyer are listed; provided, however, that such announcement
or communication shall be made after consultation with Sellers' Representative
and after taking into account the reasonable requirements of Sellers'
Representative as to timing content and manner of making such announcement or
communication.

  

  

Section 9.7 Expenses.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not
the Transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be borne by the
party incurring such costs and expenses; provided, that (i) at or prior to the
Closing, the Seller Parties may cause any Company to pay any of such expenses
accrued to the Seller Parties or any of their respective Affiliates on its
behalf (in which case such payment shall be made before 12:01 a.m. on the
Closing Date) and (ii) Buyer or its Affiliates shall not be entitled to use
any assets of any Company to pay any of such expenses accrued to Buyer or any
of its Affiliates until after the Closing (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
any expenses of Buyer or its Affiliates shall not be taken into account for
purposes of adjustments under Section 2.3, Section 2.4, Section 2.11 and

Section 9.8 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum;
Waiver of Trial by Jury. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action
or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions exclusively in the courts of the State of
Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware (the "Chosen Courts"). Solely in connection with claims arising under
this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Agreements, each party hereto (i) irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to
laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of
process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if
notice is given in accordance with Section 9.1 of this Agreement. EACH PARTY
HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto
hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitment or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located
within the City of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal court (or,
in the case of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
any Delaware Interpretation Provision (as defined in the Financing
Commitment), in the event that a concurrent suit, action or proceeding brought
by the Seller Parties against the Buyer is pending in any Delaware State court
or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, such Delaware State court
or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), and each of the parties
hereto waives any right to a jury trial in any such action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim..

  

  

Section 9.9 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that their
obligations hereunder are unique and that remedies at law, including monetary
damages, will be inadequate in the event any party should default in the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event
of any such breach, the non-defaulting party shall be entitled to equitable
relief (if the court so grants), without the proof of actual damages,
including in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific
performance (including causing Buyer to enforce its rights under any Financing
Commitment in accordance with Section 5.12) to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to order the defaulting party to affirmatively carry out its
obligations under this Agreement, and such defaulting party hereby waives any
defense to the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for
such breach or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason of law or equity. Subject to Section 8.2(d), such
equitable relief shall be in addition to any other remedy to which the parties
hereto are entitled to at law or in equity as a remedy for such
nonperformance, breach or threatened breach. Each party hereby waives any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such equitable
remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Seller
Parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Buyer to
consummate the Transactions only in the event that (i) all conditions in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing), (ii) the financing provided for by the Financing Commitment (as it
may be amended, modified or waived pursuant to Section 5.12) (or, if
alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section 5.12, pursuant
to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or will be funded at
the Closing, and (iii) the Seller Parties have irrevocably confirmed that if
specific performance is granted and the Buyer Financing is funded, then the
Closing pursuant to Article II will occur. The foregoing shall not be deemed
to be or construed as a waiver or election of remedies by either party, each
of whom, subject to Section 8.2, expressly reserve any and all rights and
remedies available to it at law or in equity in the event of any breach or
default by the other parties under this Agreement prior to the Closing.
