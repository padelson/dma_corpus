(a) _Organizational and Corporate Power_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which it was organized and the Company is
qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character or location of its assets or its properties owned, leased or

documents, except for such default that would not be reasonably expected to
prohibit or materially impede the Company's ability to satisfy its

contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Assuming due execution and delivery by the MTH Parties
and the Coleman Trust of this Agreement and the other documents contemplated
hereby to which such Persons are parties, this Agreement and the other

event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, will result in any
violation of, breach of, conflict with, default under, or acceleration of the
performance required by, any of the terms of the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of the Company or the Subsidiaries (or any similar organizational
or governing documents); and (iii) shall not result in a material violation
under any law, judgment, decree, order, rule, regulation, permit or other
legal requirement of any Government Authority applicable to the Company or
any Subsidiary, except, in each case with respect to clauses (i) through
(iii) of this _Section 3.1(c)_ , for such violations, breaches, conflicts,
defaults, or accelerations that would not reasonably be expected to prohibit
or materially impede the ability of the Company to satisfy its obligations
under this Agreement.

question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigation demand, or similar process to

it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the written request

remove their personal possessions and (b) such services described on
_Schedule 6.5(b)_.

  



  

6.6. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Coleman Trust shall give prompt notice to MTH of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would cause any representation or warranty of the Coleman Trust
contained in _Article IV_ to fail to be true and correct on the Closing Date
and (ii) any material failure of the Coleman Trust to comply with or satisfy,
in each case, in any material respect, any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by the Coleman Trust hereunder. The delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall, if the MTH Parties
proceed to consummate the transactions contemplated to be consummated at the

6.6(a)_.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to MTH of (i) the

any material failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy, in each case,
in any material respect, any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by the Company hereunder (other than such failures or breaches
caused by the action or inaction by the MTH Parties in violation of their
respective obligations under this Agreement). The delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall, if the MTH Parties proceed to

6.7. _Restrictive Covenants_.

  



  

(a) _Non-Competition_. The Coleman Trust hereby acknowledges that
it is familiar with the trade secrets of the Company and the Subsidiaries and
other Confidential Information. The Coleman Trust acknowledges and agrees
that MTH and its Affiliates would be irreparably damaged if the Coleman Trust
were to provide services or to otherwise participate in the business of any
Person competing with the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in
each case, as of the date hereof (the " _Business_ "), and that any
such competition by the Coleman Trust would result in a significant loss of
goodwill by MTH and Newco and agrees that the covenants and agreements set
forth in this _Section 6.7_ were a material inducement to MTH and Newco to
enter into this Agreement and to perform their respective obligations
hereunder, and that MTH and its Affiliates would not obtain the benefit of the
bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated by the parties
hereto if the Coleman Trust breached the provisions of this  _Section 6.7_.
Therefore, in further consideration of the Purchase Price paid, or to be paid,
to the Coleman Trust, the Coleman Trust agrees that for the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the five (5) year anniversary thereof, the
Coleman Trust shall not, directly or indirectly, either for itself or through
any other Person, engage in, participate in, or permit such Person's name to
be used by any enterprise engaging in, any business competitive with the
Business in North America, including the Caribbean. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "participate" means any direct or indirect interest in
any enterprise, whether as a shareholder, member, partner, joint venturer,
franchisor, franchisee, executive, consultant or otherwise or rendering any
direct or indirect service or assistance to any Person, other than ownership
(legally or beneficially) of securities of any Person, which in the
aggregate, constitute less than a two percent (2%) equity or voting interest,
in the issuer thereof. The Coleman Trust agrees that this covenant is
reasonably designed to protect MTH's and Newco's substantial investment and
is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.

  



  

(b) _Non-Solicitation/No Hire of Employees_. Other than as set
forth on _Schedule 6.7(b)_ , the Coleman Trust agrees that for the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the five (5) year anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Coleman Trust shall not directly, or indirectly through
another Person, (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or
a Subsidiary to leave his or her employment, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between the Company or a Subsidiary and any such employee, (ii)
hire any person who was an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary at any
time during the six-month period immediately prior to the date on which
such hiring would take place, or (iii) call on, solicit or service any
customer, vendor, licensee, licensor or other business relation of the
Company or a Subsidiary in order to induce or attempt to induce such Person to
cease doing or decrease their business with the Company or its Affiliates, or
in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, vendor,
licensee, licensor or business relation and the Company or its Affiliates
(including making any negative statements or communications about the
Company or its Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall not apply to the Coleman Trust with
respect to any Person whose employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been terminated, in each case, at least six (6) months prior
to the Closing Date.

(c) _Non-Disparagement_.

  



  

(i) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, the

places any of the MTH Parties, the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Company or any of their Affiliates in a false or negative
light, except (A) in connection with a legal proceeding in which the Coleman
Trust is under oath or responding to a subpoena or is otherwise required by
law to cooperate with a Government Authority, (B) for conferring in confidence
with legal representatives, or (C) for responding publicly to incorrect,
disparaging or defamatory statements made by the MTH Parties and their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors/managers and employees.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.7(c)(i)_  to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 6.7(c)(i)_ shall be construed to limit any assertion
of any rights or remedies available to the Coleman Trust (or any applicable
third party beneficiary) under this Agreement or prohibit the Coleman Trust
(or any applicable third party beneficiary) from making any assertions in
connection with the assertion of any such rights or remedies.

  



  

(ii) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, the
MTH Parties shall not make (and shall cause the Company and its

respective Affiliates in a false or negative light, except (A) in connection
with a legal proceeding in which the applicable MTH Party is under oath or
responding to a subpoena or is otherwise required by law to cooperate with a
Government Authority, (B) for conferring in confidence with legal
representatives, or (C) for responding publicly to incorrect, disparaging or
defamatory statements made by the Coleman Trust, the Trust Beneficial Owners
or any of their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 6.7(c)(ii)_ to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.7(c)(ii)_
shall be construed to limit any assertion of any rights or remedies available
to the MTH Parties (or any applicable third party beneficiary) under this
Agreement or prohibit the MTH Parties (or any applicable third party
beneficiary) from making any assertions in connection with the assertion of
any such rights or remedies.

  



  

(d) _Use of Name_. From and after the Closing: (a) except in

Subsidiary's business and any reproduction, counterfeit, derivative, copy or
colorable imitation thereof; and (b) the Coleman Trust shall not retain any
right, directly or indirectly, in or to the foregoing or use the same, in
whole or in part, in any trademark, service mark, trade name, domain names or
logo.

(e) _Modification_. If, at the time of enforcement of any of the
provisions of this _Section 6.7_ , a court determines that the restrictions
stated herein are unreasonable under the circumstances then existing, the
parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area

geographical area permitted by law.

  



  

(f) _Extension of Restricted Period_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the restricted periods set forth in

any breaching party for a period equal to any time period that such breaching
party is in violation of _Section 6.7(a)_ or _(b)_ , respectively.

  



  

(g) _Irreparable Harm_. If the Coleman Trust breaches, or
threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of _Section 6.5_ or
this  _Section 6.7_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), MTH and Newco shall
have the right to seek to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically
enforced in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 12.4_ , it
being agreed that any breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive
Covenants may cause irreparable injury to MTH and its Affiliates and that
money damages may not provide an adequate remedy to MTH or its Affiliates.

contrary), the MTH Parties will, and will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and
release from any liability to any of the MTH Parties or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries), the DandO Indemnified Persons against any loss, liability,
damage, cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements (collectively, " _D andO Costs_") incurred by reason of any
demands, claims, suits, actions, or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of the DandO Indemnified Person's
services as a director, or as an officer, or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing (including in respect of acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby); except to the extent that such indemnification is not
allowed by law or to the extent that such DandO Costs arose from an act or
omission by the DandO Indemnified Person as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction or by arbitration to constitute any criminal or
deliberately fraudulent or dishonest act or a willful violation of any law,
statute, rule or regulation.  DandO Costs incurred will be paid by the DandO
Indemnifying Party sufficiently in advance of the final disposition of
such claim (and in any event within thirty (30) days of the written request
therefor submitted by a DandO Indemnified Person, subject to the proviso below)
to enable the DandO Indemnitee to pay its expenses in connection with such
claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such DandO Indemnified Person shall have
first delivered to the Company or the applicable Subsidiary an undertaking,
by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Person, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal that such DandO
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified or reimbursed for the
DandO Costs. If a claim for indemnification or advancement under this
_Section 6.19(b)_ is not paid in full, a DandO Indemnified Person may at any
time thereafter bring suit to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such
suit, or in a suit brought by a DandO Indemnified Person to recover an
advancement of expenses, the DandO Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.

(c) At the Closing, the MTH Parties will, or will cause the Company
to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies
naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims
period of at least six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance
carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company\'s existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date.
The MTH Parties will not, and will cause the Company to not, cancel or change
such insurance policies in any respect.

  



  

(d) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of
transactions, then the MTH Parties and the Company will, and in each such
case, use its best efforts to ensure that the successors and assigns of the
Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.19_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.19(d)_ will apply to all of the successors and
assigns of the Company.

  



  

6.20. _Certain Employee Matters_. The MTH Parties shall take such
action as may be necessary so that on and after the Closing, and at all
times through and including December 31, 2015, officers and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who are in the employ of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (" _Covered Employees_ "), are
provided employee benefits, plans and programs (including incentive
compensation, deferred compensation, pension, superannuation, life insurance,
welfare, profit sharing, 401(k), severance, salary continuation and fringe
benefits as they exist immediately prior to Closing (collectively, the "
_Benefit Plans_ ")) that are identified on _Schedule 6.20_ attached hereto and
made available by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such officers and
employees immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Company and/or its Subsidiaries may
make such changes to the Benefit Plans that may occur and be necessary in the
ordinary course (e.g., renewals) or in order to comply with Law as long as the
Benefit Plans, individually and in the aggregate, offer the Covered Employees
substantially the same benefits in all material respects. Nothing contained
in this _Section 6.20_ shall create any rights in any officer or employee or
former officer or employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment for any
specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever. Nothing in this _Section
6.20_ will or is intended to create any third party beneficiary right in any
Covered Employee or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or in any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement.

  



  

6.21. _Master Limited Partnership Matters_. For the one (1) year period
immediately following the Closing Date, none of the MTH Parties shall, and
the MTH Parties shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
engage in any transaction or series of transactions to (i) create a master
limited partnership with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether through a limited partnership or limited liability company) or (ii)
transfer any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such
master limited partnership.

6.22. _Employee Payments_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Coleman Trust has designated $17,450,000 as the bonus pool (the "Bonus Pool")
and elected to have the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make cash payments
on the first (1st) Business Day occurring on or after the sixteenth (16th)
day of the third calendar month following the Closing Date (i.e., October 16,
2014 if the Closing Date occurs in July) (the "Bonus Pool Payment Date") out
of the Bonus Pool (" _Discretionary Employee Payments_ ") to certain
individuals who were employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, in the amounts specified in _Exhibit 6.22_ hereto. Newco
shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make the Discretionary
Employee Payments on the Bonus Pool Payment Date, net of applicable
withholdings required by applicable Law to the individuals and in the amounts
specified in _Exhibit 6.22_ and remit all applicable withholding taxes to
the appropriate taxing authorities. Upon submission of documentation of the
payment of the Discretionary Employee Payments and remission of withholding
taxes in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence and in accordance
with the terms of an escrow agreement among the Company, the Coleman Trust,
MTH, and SunTrust Bank, which shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Coleman Trust and MTH (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "),
Escrow Agent shall disburse to Company an amount equal to the Bonus Pool in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Parties further
acknowledge and agree that any Discretionary Employee Payments shall be
treated as compensation for income Tax purposes in exchange for services
rendered by such employee to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

6.23. _Charitable Contribution Amounts_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that at or immediately prior to the Closing, the Coleman Trust shall
designate $750,000 to be contributed to any 501(c)(3) organizations selected
at the sole discretion of the Coleman Trust (the " _Charitable Contribution
Amounts_ "). The Charitable Contribution Amounts shall be disbursed as
instructed by the Coleman Trust at Closing. The Parties further acknowledge
and agree that any Charitable Contribution Amounts shall be treated as
charitable contributions made by the Company for income Tax purposes.

  



  

6.24. _Financing Efforts_. From the date hereof until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing, the MTH
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Financing
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby, including, as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, (a) MIC's filing with the
SEC of a registration statement with respect to the issuance of equity and/or
debt securities in connection with the Financing, (b) engaging in "road
shows" and similar marketing efforts, including the preparation of marketing
materials, to the extent necessary to consummate the Financing, all as and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, and (c) making available to
prospective investors in MIC (or any other MTH Party) in connection with the
Financing such materials as such Persons may reasonably request (in a manner
customary for transactions of the kind implicated by the Financing), all as
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

ARTICLE IX 
 INDEMNITY

  



  

9.1. _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by the Coleman Trust_. The Coleman Trust
covenants and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the MTH Parties and their
respective officers, directors, managers, employees, stockholders, assigns,
successors and Subsidiaries (individually, an " _MTH Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _MTH Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Damages
suffered, sustained, incurred or paid by any MTH Indemnified Party to the
extent resulting from or arising out of:

  



  

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Coleman
Trust set forth in _Article IV_ this Agreement, as applicable;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , if any such representation or warranty is qualified by
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, the word "material" or by words of
similar impact, such qualifications will be disregarded and deemed not
included in such representation or warranty for purposes of calculating any
Damages arising therefrom;

  



    

31 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) the nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of the Coleman Trust set forth in this Agreement; and

  



  

(iii) the Coleman Transaction Costs not paid at or prior to the
Closing.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by the MTH Parties_. The MTH Parties covenant
and agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless the Coleman
Trust, the Trust Beneficial Owners and their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, assigns, and successors (each,
a " _CT Indemnified Party_ ") from, against and in respect of all Damages
actually suffered, sustained, incurred or paid by such CT Indemnified Party,
to the extent directly resulting from or arising out of: (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty made by a MTH Party set forth in _Sections 5.1,_
_5.2,_ _5.3_ , _5.6_ and _5.7_ of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
if any such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, Material
Adverse Effect, the word "material" or by words of similar impact, such
qualifications will be disregarded and deemed not included in
such representation or warranty for purposes of calculating any Damages
arising therefrom, or (ii) the nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of a MTH Party set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

9.2. _Indemnification Procedures_. The terms " _Indemnified Party_ "
or " _Indemnified Parties_ ", when appearing without the modifying term
"MTH", shall refer to whichever Party is then seeking indemnification
hereunder. All claims or demands for indemnification under this _Article IX_
(" _Claims_ ") against the Party alleged to be required to
provide indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

  



  

(a) In the event an Indemnified Party has a Claim against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected by a third party (a " _Direct
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness send a
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of such Direct Claim to the Coleman
Trust or MTH, as the case may be. In order for the Claim Notice to be
properly so delivered, it must contain a reasonably detailed description of
the facts and circumstances serving as the basis for such Direct Claim, a
statement of the amount sought (or, if the amount is not then known, a good
faith estimate of the amount sought) by the Indemnified Party, and specific
reference the provision of this Agreement providing the basis for the Direct
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party, or its duly appointed representative, does
not notify the Indemnified Party within ninety (90) days of the delivery of
the Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such Claim, the amount
of such Claim shall be conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying
Party. In case the Indemnifying Party, or its duly appointed representative,
shall object in writing to any Claim made in accordance with this _Section
9.2(a)_, the Indemnified Party shall have fifteen (15) days to respond in a
written statement to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such
15-day period there remains a dispute as to such Direct Claim, the Parties
shall attempt in good faith for fifteen (15) days to agree upon the rights of
the respective Parties with respect to each of such Claims. If the Parties
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by both Parties. If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, either the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party may
seek to exercise such rights and remedies provided for under this Agreement.

  



    

32 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) In the event that any Claim for which the Coleman Trust would be
liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted by a third party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate
in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party of its intent and written acknowledgment that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will continue to be entitled to assert any
limitation on any claims contained in this _Article IX_. Should an
Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying
Party will control such defense. The Indemnifying Party will be liable, but
only to the extent liability is imposed by _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section
9.1(b)_ , as applicable, of this _Article IX_ , for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which
the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim,
all the Parties will cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party\'s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees and other representatives and advisors available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding  _Section 9.2(b)_ , the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (i)
unless the Third Party Claim is solely for monetary damages (except where any
non-monetary relief being sought is merely incidental to a primary claim for
monetary damages) or (ii) if the Third Party Claim involves criminal
allegations.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.2_ to the contrary,
the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement of any Third
Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party if such
settlement (i) would create any Liability of the Indemnified Party for which
the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, (ii) would
provide for any injunctive relief or other non-monetary obligation affecting
the Indemnified Party, or (iii) does not include an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of the Third Party Claim.

  



  

(e)  The Indemnified Party's failure to give reasonably prompt
notice to the Indemnifying Party of any Third Party Claim or demand which may
give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to
the Indemnified Party unless the failure to give such notice materially and
adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

  



    

33

--- 

    



  

9.3. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Each
covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement or in any agreement
or other document delivered pursuant hereto contemplated to be performed
after Closing shall survive the Closing and be enforceable until such
covenant or agreement has been fully performed. All representations and
warranties contained in _Article IV_ and the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 5.1,_ _5.2,_ _5.3_ , _5.6_ and _5.7_ shall
survive indefinitely, and all representations and warranties contained in
_Articles III_ and _V_ , (other than in _Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ ,

to _Section 10.1(a)(ii)_ or a failure of the Coleman Trust or the Company to
satisfy the conditions specified in _Section 7.5_ ) or (ii) did not occur as

nature) on or prior to the Closing, arising out of or related to the Coleman
Trust's ownership (directly or indirectly) of equity in the Company, the
Shareholders' Agreement, the Company, the Subsidiaries or any matter, cause or
event occurring on or prior to the Closing, which any Releasing MTH Person
can, shall or may have against any Trust Released Party or the Trust Released
Parties, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, concealed or
hidden, suspected or unsuspected, anticipated or unanticipated, both at law
or in equity, whether or not arising contemporaneously with or prior to the
Closing, or on account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event
occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing as well as any matter
that may now exist or may hereinafter accrue based on matters now known as
well as unknown (collectively, the " _MTH Released Claims_ "), and hereby
irrevocably agrees to refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any claim
or demand or commencing (or causing to be commenced or consenting to the
commencement of) any proceeding of any kind before any Government Authority,
against any Trust Released Party based upon any MTH Released Claim.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this _Section 12.19(b)_ , "MTH
Released Claims" does not include, and the provisions of this _Section
12.19(b)_ shall not release or otherwise diminish, (i) the obligations of the
Coleman Trust, its Affiliates or any of their respective successors or assigns
expressly set forth in any provisions of this Agreement or any other
agreement or document contemplated herein, (ii) the obligations of any insurer
under any insurance policy or (iii) any of the obligations under the
Specified Contracts (collectively, the " _MTH Retained Claims_ "). In
furtherance of the foregoing, except as expressly provided herein, the
Releasing MTH Persons specifically intend this release to be the broadest
possible release permitted under law with respect to the matters released
hereunder.
