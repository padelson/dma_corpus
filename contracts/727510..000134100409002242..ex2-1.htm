PURCHASE PRICE; ADJUSTMENTS; MILESTONES; ROYALTIES

 

 

Section 3.1 Purchase Price; Payment. In consideration of the sale, transfer,
assignment, conveyance and delivery by the Seller of the Assets, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchasing Parties shall
(a) pay to the Seller an aggregate of $300,000,000, as adjusted pursuant to
Section 3.2(a) (the "Cash Purchase Price"), plus the milestone and royalty
payments contemplated by Section 3.3, and (b) assume the Assumed Liabilities.
For purposes of this Agreement, the "Purchase Price" shall mean the
aggregate amount paid by the Purchasing Parties in consideration of
the purchase and assumption by them of the Assets and Assumed Liabilities,
including the Cash Purchase Price and all milestone and royalty payments made
pursuant to Section 3.3 and following all adjustments made pursuant to
Section 3.4 and indemnification payments made pursuant to Article XI.

 

 

Section 3.2 Payment at the Closing.

 

 

(a) Not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
and the Purchasing Parties shall mutually agree on a schedule, based upon the
Balance Sheet and substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule
3.2(a) (the "Preliminary Working Capital Schedule"), setting forth the
Parties\' good faith estimate as of the Closing Date of the current Accounts
Receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, Inventory, net of
allowance for obsolete Products, and other current assets (including Prepaid
Expenses and Other Current Assets) of the Business that are included in the
Assets ("Current Assets") minus the Accounts Payable, Accrued Employee
Compensation, Benefits and Other Liabilities and other current liabilities of
the Business (other than Taxes payable) that are included in the Assumed
Liabilities (the "Current Liabilities") (the results of such calculation, the
"Preliminary Working Capital"). The Preliminary Working Capital Schedule
shall be prepared using accounting principles, practices and methods
consistent with those used in preparing the Balance Sheet with adjustments
for changes occurring in the period between the date of the Balance Sheet and
the Closing Date. If the amount of the Preliminary Working Capital exceeds
the Target Amount, then the Cash Purchase Price shall be increased by
the excess. If the amount of Preliminary Working Capital is less than
the Target Amount, the Cash Purchase Price shall be decreased by
the shortfall. In order to determine the Preliminary Working Capital,
the Seller shall provide the Purchasing Parties and their Representatives
with all data and financial statements, reasonable access to the Books and
Records and any other information reasonably required by the Purchasing
Parties and customarily prepared by the Seller prior to the date of this
Agreement for the determination of the Preliminary Working Capital.

 

 

(b) At the Closing, (i) Klee shall pay to the Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Seller not later
than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Manufacturing Assets
Purchase Price; and (ii) Defiante shall pay to the Seller, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

Seller not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount
equal to the Cash Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2(a),
minus the Manufacturing Assets Purchase Price.

 

 

Section 3.3 Milestone and Royalty Payments.

 

 

(a) In addition to the amount payable by Defiante pursuant to Section 3.2(b),
Defiante shall make the following milestone payments to the Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts of the
Seller designated by the Seller:

 

 

(i) $5,000,000 within ten Business Days after Defiante (or any successor
thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) receives FDA Approval
(including for this purpose any such approval deemed granted 30 days
following the submission of any "Supplement--Change Being Effected in 30
Days" applications or similar approvals) for SS Oncaspar®;

 

 

(ii) $7,000,000 within ten Business Days after Defiante (or any successor
thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) receives FDA Approval for SC
Oncaspar®; and

 

 

(iii) either (A) $15,000,000, if Defiante (or any successor thereto pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement) receives EMEA Approval for SC Oncaspar® on an
accelerated, conditional or expedited basis (including any EMEA Approval
granted prior to the completion of any additional clinical trial other than
the clinical trial for SC Oncaspar® that is ongoing in the United States as
of the date of this Agreement), or (B) $10,000,000, if Defiante (or any
successor thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) receives EMEA
Approval for SC Oncaspar® on a non-accelerated basis, in either case within
ten Business Days after the EMEA Approval is received.

 

 

(b) In addition to the amount payable by Defiante pursuant to Section 3.2(b)
and the milestone payments set forth in Section 3.3(a), Defiante shall make
the following royalty payments to the Seller, on a quarterly basis not later
than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter (with payments made in
respect of each of the first three calendar quarters of each applicable year
constituting Defiante\'s good faith estimate of the royalty owed for such
quarter, and with the payment made in respect of the fourth calendar quarter
of such year including a "true up" for the first three calendar quarters\'
payments, based on actual amounts owed by Defiante in respect of such three
calendar quarters relative to amounts paid by Defiante), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts of the Seller
designated by the Seller:

 

 

(i) With respect to sales of the Products in the United States for each of
calendar years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, Defiante shall pay to the
Seller 5% of the amount, if any, by which Net Receipts in the United States
for each such calendar year exceed the Baseline Amount applicable to the
United States.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(ii) With respect to sales of the Products outside the United States: (A) for
each of calendar years 2010 and 2011, Defiante shall pay to the Seller 10% of
the amount, if any, by which aggregate Net Receipts for all territories
outside the United States for each such calendar year exceed the Baseline
Amount applicable to such territories, and (B) for each of calendar years
2012, 2013 and 2014, Defiante shall pay to the Seller 5% of the amount, if
any, by which aggregate Net Receipts for all territories outside the United
States for each such calendar year exceed the Baseline Amount applicable to
such territories.

 

 

(iii) In connection with any payments made pursuant to this Section 3.3(b),
Defiante shall simultaneously deliver to the Seller a schedule setting forth
in reasonable detail the calculation of Net Receipts pursuant to each of
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).

 

 

(iv) Defiante agrees that, during calendar years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2014, it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, agents, licensees, sub-
licensees and distributors not to, distribute, bundle or otherwise sell any
Product in any manner that would reduce the Gross Sales of such Product in
favor of other revenue not subject to the royalties set forth in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).

 

 

(v) In the event that, during calendar years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014,
either of the Purchasing Parties or any of their Affiliates, directly or
indirectly, licenses its rights in any Product such that the full amount of
the invoiced sales of such Product are no longer counted as Gross Sales of
such Product, (A) such license shall only be made upon arms-length terms and
(B) the consideration received in respect of such license shall, for purposes
of calculating the royalties owed to the Seller pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), be treated as Net Receipts as of the time of such
license.

 

 

(vi) Defiante will maintain for a period of three years following the close
of each of calendar years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 true and complete
books containing an accurate record of all data necessary for the proper
computation of royalties under this Agreement. The Seller will have the
right, upon written request to Defiante and through the Independent
Accounting Firm, to inspect the relevant records of Defiante at any time
within such three year period (but not more than once in any calendar year)
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of all payments or charges used to
calculate royalties payable under this Agreement; provided that
such inspection shall only occur during regular business hours, without
unreasonable disruption to the business or operations of Defiante, at such
place or places where such books and records are customarily kept. The
Parties agree that information furnished as a result of any such inspection
will be limited to a written statement by the Independent Accounting Firm to
the effect that it has reviewed the books and records of Defiante and either
(A) the Gross Sales and Net Receipts claimed by Defiante are in conformity
with such books and records and the applicable provisions of this Agreement
or (B) setting forth any required adjustments. The

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with this
Section 3.3(b)(vi) will be borne by the Seller, except as provided below.
If any such examination shows any underpayment or overpayment, or overcharge
or undercharge, a correcting payment or refund will be made within 30 days
after receipt of the written statement described above. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such inspection indicates that, with respect to any
calendar year, the amount of royalties that should have been paid in such
year by Defiante exceeds the amount actually paid in such year by Defiante by
greater than 5%, then Defiante shall bear all reasonable and documented costs
associated with such examination (including the costs of the accountants
performing the verification and the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of
the Seller). The Seller agrees to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Independent Accounting Firm to, hold in confidence all
information learned in the course of any audit or inspection, except to the
extent necessary to reveal such information in order to enforce its rights
under this Agreement or pursuant to applicable Law. Defiante will not have
any obligation to maintain records pertaining to amounts charged by them or
payments due from them under this Agreement beyond such three year periods.
The results of each inspection, if any, will be binding on the Parties,
absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error by the Independent Accounting Firm.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, until the
last payment contemplated by this Section 3.3 has been made to the Seller,
the Purchasing Parties and their Affiliates shall not sell, assign, transfer,
dispose of or convey any of the Products or the Business to a third party
unless such third party has agreed, in manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Seller, to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Section 3.3 and to
assume all of the obligations of the Purchasing Parties contemplated by this
Agreement (including pursuant to this Section 3.3 and Section 7.24);
provided, however, that Defiante shall guarantee the payment by such third
party of amounts payable to the Seller pursuant to this Section 3.3, if and
when, and limited to the extent that, such third party defaults under its
payment obligations. The Seller shall provide to Defiante (i) notice of the
extent to which such third party has defaulted under such payment obligations
and (ii) a demand for payment by Defiante of the amount of such obligations,
less the amount in respect thereof that such third party has already paid to
the Seller through and including the date of such demand. Defiante shall,
within 30 days of receipt of demand for payment from the Seller, pay the
unpaid amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by the Seller. Defiante reserves the right to assert
defenses that such third party may have to any payment guaranteed hereunder.

 

 

(d) If Defiante (or any successor thereto pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement) fails to pay in full on or before the date due any royalty or
milestone payment that is required to be paid under this Agreement, Defiante
(or any successor thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) will also
pay to the Seller, on demand, interest on any such amount beginning on such
due date at an annual rate (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year) equal
to the "base rate" of Citibank, N.A., or any successor thereto, in New York,
New York in effect on such due date, to be assessed from the date payment of
the amount in question first became due.

Section 3.4 Adjustment to Purchase Price.

 

 

(a) Within 45 days following the Closing, the Seller shall prepare and
deliver to the Purchasing Parties a schedule (the "Closing Working
Capital Schedule"), in the form attached hereto as Schedule 3.4(a), setting
forth a calculation of the Current Assets and Current Liabilities as of the
Closing (the "Closing Working Capital"), which shall be prepared on the same
basis and using accounting principles, practices and methods consistent with
those used to prepare the Preliminary Working Capital Schedule and the
Balance Sheet. During such period, the Purchasing Parties shall provide the
Seller and its Representatives with all data and financial statements
reasonably requested by the Seller, and full access to the Books and Records,
any other information, and to any employees to the extent necessary for the
Seller to prepare the Closing Working Capital Schedule.

 

 

(b) The Purchasing Parties shall have 60 days after the delivery by the
Seller to review the Closing Working Capital Schedule. The Seller shall, from
and after the Closing Date, provide the Purchasing Parties and their
Representatives with all data and financial statements reasonably requested
by the Purchasing Parties, and full access to any information, and to any
employees to the extent necessary for the Purchasing Parties to review the
Closing Working Capital Schedule. In the event that the Purchasing Parties
object to any of the items in the Closing Working Capital Schedule, the
Purchasing Parties shall, on or before the last day of such 60 day period,
inform the Seller in writing (the "Purchasers\' Objection"), setting forth a
specific description of the basis of the Purchasers\' Objection and the
adjustments to the Closing Working Capital that the Purchasing Parties
believe should be made. Failure to notify the Seller within such 60 day
period shall constitute acceptance and approval by the Purchasing Parties of
the Closing Working Capital Schedule. If the Purchasing Parties deliver a
Purchasers\' Objection to the Seller on or before the last day of such 60 day
period, the Parties shall then have 15 days to negotiate in good faith to
resolve the disputes set forth in the Purchasers\' Objection as expeditiously
as possible and, if the Parties so resolve such disputes, the Closing Working
Capital and the Closing Working Capital Schedule, as amended to the extent
necessary to reflect the resolution of such disputes, shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Parties. It is acknowledged and agreed that any items in the
Closing Working Capital Schedule not set forth in the Purchasers\' Objection
shall be deemed to be conclusively accepted and approved by the Purchasing
Parties.

 

 

(c) If the Purchasing Parties and the Seller are unable to resolve all of
their disagreements with respect to the determination of Closing Working
Capital by the expiration of such 15-day period, they shall promptly refer
any remaining disagreements to a mutually agreeable nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants (the "Independent Accounting Firm"),
which shall determine, solely on the basis of the standard set forth in
Section 3.4(a) and only with respect to the remaining disagreements
and objections so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing
Working Capital requires adjustment. Each of the Purchasing Parties and
the Seller shall make complete submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm
within ten days following the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm.
Any materials submitted by a Party to the Independent Accounting Firm after
such ten-day period shall be ignored by the Independent Accounting Firm. The
Parties shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to deliver its written
determination to the Seller and the Purchasing Parties within 30 days after
the expiration of such ten-day period. The

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute and determine the
Closing Working Capital, not on the basis of an independent review, but only
within the disputed range and based on the standard set forth in Section
3.4(a). Such resolution shall be set forth in a written statement delivered
to the Purchasing Parties and the Seller. The Independent Accounting
Firm\'s determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Seller and the
Purchasing Parties, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error by the
Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by the Purchasing Parties, on one
hand, and the Seller, on the other hand.

 

 

(d) Within ten Business Days following determination of the Closing Working
Capital (as may be adjusted by agreement of the Parties or the determination
of the Independent Accounting Firm, as the case may be), the Seller or the
Purchasing Parties, as the case may be, shall make an adjustment payment in
an amount equal to the difference between the Preliminary Working Capital and
the Closing Working Capital. The adjustment payment will be made by the
Seller to the Purchasing Parties to the extent that the Closing Working
Capital is less than the Preliminary Working Capital and by the Purchasing
Parties to the Seller to the extent that Closing Working Capital is greater
than the Preliminary Working Capital. The adjustment payment shall bear
interest (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year) from the Closing Date to
and including the day immediately prior to payment at the "base rate" of
Citibank, N.A., or any successor thereto, in New York, New York in effect on
the Closing Date. The adjustment payment shall be treated for all tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and shall be paid by wire
transfer, in immediately available funds, to a bank account or accounts
designated by the Seller or the Purchasing Parties, as the case may be.

 

 

Section 3.5 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Seller and the Purchasing
Parties agree that the portion of the Cash Purchase Price allocable to the
Manufacturing Assets is $30,000,000 (the "Manufacturing Assets Purchase
Price"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Seller and the Purchasing
Parties determine, after the date hereof, that the Manufacturing Assets
Purchase Price is not accurate in all material respects, then they shall
consult with each other on such price and may mutually agree to amend the
amount of the Manufacturing Assets Purchase Price prior to the Closing. The
Seller and the Purchasing Parties further agree that the remainder of the
Cash Purchase Price and the relevant Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated
among the Non-Manufacturing Assets, and the Manufacturing Assets Purchase
Price shall be allocated among the Manufacturing Assets, in each case in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. The Cash Purchase Price (which for
these purposes shall include the amount of the relevant Assumed Liabilities)
shall be allocated among the respective Assets in accordance with schedules
that each of Klee and Defiante shall provide to the Seller within 90 days
after the Closing. Thereafter, the Seller shall have 25 days either to (a)
agree with and accept such schedules or (b) in good faith suggest changes to
either such schedule and attempt to agree with the respective Purchasing
Party as to the contents of the applicable schedule (with the resulting
agreed-upon schedule in both instances called the "Allocation Schedule" with
respect to the relevant Assets). The Seller, on the one hand, and each of the
Purchasing Parties, on the other hand, shall provide each other promptly with
any other information required to complete the respective Allocation
Schedule. If the Seller and the respective Purchasing Party agree on the
applicable Allocation Schedule within 135 days following the Closing, the
Seller and such Purchasing Party shall file Internal Revenue Service Form
8594 and any required attachments thereto ("Form 8594"), together with all
federal, state and local tax returns, in a manner

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

consistent with and in accordance with such Allocation Schedule. In
addition, the Seller and each Purchasing Party hereby undertake and agree to
timely file any information that may be required to be filed pursuant to the
U.S. Department of Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 1060(b) of
the Code. If the Seller and the respective Purchasing Party are unable
to reach such agreement within 135 days following the Closing, the allocation
of the applicable portion of the Cash Purchase Price (and the amount of
the relevant Assumed Liabilities) shall be determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm within 30 days after it is retained for such purpose,
provided that such allocation is reasonable and in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the U.S. Department of Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder. Within 10 days after filing Form 8594 with the
Internal Revenue Service pursuant to this Section 3.5, each Party shall
provide the other with a copy of such form as filed.

wherein, by reason of the nature of the Business or the character of the
Assets, it is necessary for the Seller to be so authorized, qualified or

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and, subject to receipt
of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The

the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or

Section 5.3 Binding Agreement. This Agreement has been (and, when executed
and delivered, the Ancillary Agreements will have been) duly executed and
delivered by the Seller and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution
and delivery hereof and thereof by the Purchasing Parties, this Agreement is
(and, when executed and delivered, each of the Ancillary Agreements will be)

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other
similar Laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors\'
rights generally and (b) the availability of the remedy of specific

Business, including the number of units, cost to Seller per unit, and total
cost of goods per type of Inventory, as of the most recent available date
prior to the date of this Agreement. All items of Inventory are determined

pending "Supplement--Changes Being Effected in 30 Days" applications, all of
the Inventory is good and merchantable and is of a quality and quantity
presently usable or salable in the ordinary course of business.

 

 

Section 5.27 Indenture. The consummation of the Transactions does not
implicate Section 6.8 of that certain indenture, dated as of May 23, 2006, as

Parties shall have no obligation in connection with such indenture following
the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise.

ARTICLE VI

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASING PARTIES

 

 

Each of the Purchasing Parties hereby jointly and severally represents and
warrants, and, solely with respect to Section 6.4, Sigma-Tau represents and
warrants, to the Seller as follows:

 

 

Section 6.1 Organization. Each Purchasing Party is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

and has all requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where
the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such
power and authority would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 6.2 Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action. Each
Purchasing Party has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by each
Purchasing Party and the consummation by the Purchasing Parties of the
Transactions has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action of the Purchasing Parties, and no other corporate proceeding on the
part of the Purchasing Parties is necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or to consummate the
Transactions. No vote of, or consent by, the holders of any class or series
of stock or Voting Debt issued by either Purchasing Party is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by either Purchasing Party of this
Agreement or the consummation by either of them of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been (and, when executed and delivered, the Ancillary
Agreements will have been) duly executed and delivered by the Purchasing
Parties and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
hereof and thereof by the Seller, this Agreement is (and, when executed and
delivered, each of the Ancillary Agreements will be) a valid and binding
obligation of the Purchasing Parties, enforceable against the Purchasing
Parties in accordance with its terms except (a) as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and
other similar laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally and (b) the availability of the remedy
of specific performance or injunctive or other forms of equitable relief may
be subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

 

 

Section 6.3 Governmental Approvals; Consent; No Violations. Except (x) the
expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and (y) any applicable
foreign antitrust or competition Law filings, no Consent of any Governmental
Entity is required to be obtained or made following the date of this
Agreement by the Purchasing Parties in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, except
for such Consents that have already been obtained or made. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation by the
Purchasing Parties of the Transactions will (a) violate or conflict with any
provision of the organizational documents of the Purchasing Parties or (b)
conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute, with or
without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, a default or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under, the
terms of any note, bond, indenture, mortgage or agreement to which either
Purchasing Party is a party or by which either Purchasing Party or any of its
Affiliates is bound, except for any such conflict, violation, breach or
default which would not reasonably be likely to result in a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 6.4 Financial Capacity. An accurate and complete copy of the
commitment letter, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions
of which, the lending party thereto (the "Lender") has committed to lend the
amount set forth therein to Sigma-Tau for the purpose of funding the
Transactions (the "Financing"), is attached hereto as Exhibit

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

H (the "Commitment Letter"). The Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise modified in any
respect, and, to the knowledge of Sigma-Tau is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Lender. To the knowledge of Sigma-Tau, the Commitment
Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Lender to make the Financing available to Sigma-Tau on the terms therein. As
of the date of this Agreement, (a) there are no other agreements, side
letters or arrangements relating to the Commitment Letter or the Financing
that could affect the availability or amount of the Financing (other than
this Agreement) and (b) no event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of
Sigma-Tau under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter. Together with
available internal funds, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing will be
sufficient to consummate the Transactions, including the payment of the Cash
Purchase Price and the payment of all associated costs and expenses.

 

 

Section 6.5 Brokers or Finders. Except in connection with the Commitment
Letter, no broker, finder or investment bank is entitled to any brokerage,
finder\'s fee, or similar fee or commission from the Purchasing Parties or
their Affiliates in connection with any of the Transactions.

 

 

Section 6.6 Litigation. There are no Legal Proceedings pending against
either Purchasing Party or, to the Knowledge of the Purchasing Parties,
threatened, at law or in equity, or before any Governmental Entity against
either Purchasing Party that, if determined or resolved adversely against
such Purchasing Party, would prevent the ability of such Purchasing Party to
consummate the Transactions. Neither Purchasing Party is in default under any
material Order.

 

 

Section 6.7 Solvency. Assuming the accuracy as of the Closing Date of the
Seller\'s representations and warranties and the performance by the Seller of
its covenants set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and after giving
effect to the Transactions and the payment of all amounts required to be paid
in connection therewith, including the Financing, each Purchasing Party will
be Solvent and will have adequate capital to carry on its business and
otherwise meet all of its obligations contained herein, including in Article
XI.

 

 

Section 6.8 Existing Indebtedness. With respect to all obligations of either
of the Purchasing Parties for borrowed money or evidenced by bonds,
debentures, notes or similar instruments, or upon which interest payments are
customarily made, the Purchasing Parties are not in default, and no waiver of
any such default is in effect, and no event or condition exists (including
the consummation of the Transactions) with respect to any such obligations
that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would
permit) one or more Persons to cause any such obligation to become due and
payable before its regularly scheduled date of payment.

 

 

Section 6.9 No Vote Required. No vote of the holder of any class or series
of stock or Voting Debt issued by either Purchasing Party is necessary to
approve the Transactions.

 

 

Section 6.10 No Knowledge of Breaches. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Purchasing Party nor any of its respective Affiliates is aware that
any representation or warranty of the Seller set forth in Article V is untrue
or incorrect.

statement for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2009 and for the

adequate capital to carry on its business and otherwise meet all of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

representations and warranties contained in this Article VI or in any other
document or instrument delivered by the Purchasing Parties pursuant to this
Agreement, neither the Purchasing Parties nor any other Person makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of the
Purchasing Parties.

their independent accountants, to have access during normal business hours
and upon reasonable advance notice to the Facility and Books and Records to

operations of the Seller, any of its Affiliates or the Business and provided,
further, that prior to the Closing the Purchasing Parties shall not have
access to (a) any (i) privileged information or (ii) information that the

Parties may from time to time reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything to

with each other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable
(subject to any applicable Laws) to effect the Closing and consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
which efforts

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

include the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices
required to be filed to consummate the Closing and the Transactions and the
taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite Consents by
any third party or Governmental Entity. In addition, neither Party shall take
any action or cause or permit any of its Affiliates to take any action after

applicable Governmental Entity in compliance with such request. Neither Party
shall participate, or cause or permit its Affiliates to participate, in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigations or inquiries concerning this Agreement unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting.

 

 

(c) The Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Parties, on the other
hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly file or
cause to be filed all filings with Governmental Entities required in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) filing within
15 Business Days of the date of this Agreement all required filings under the
HSR Act, (iii) any applicable foreign antitrust or competition Law filings
and (iii) submissions of additional information requested by the FTC, DOJ,
state attorney general or any other Governmental Entity. Each of the
Purchasing Parties and the Seller further agrees that it shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, comply with any applicable post-Closing notification
or other requirements of any antitrust, trade competition, investment or
control reporting or similar Law or regulation of any Governmental Entity
with competent jurisdiction. Each of the Purchasing Parties and the Seller
agrees to cooperate with and promptly to consult with, to provide any
reasonably available information with respect to, and to provide, subject to
appropriate confidentiality provisions, copies of all presentations and
filings to any Governmental Entity to the other party or its counsel. Each
Party agrees not to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions
except with the prior written consent of the other Party.

 

 

(d) In addition to the agreements set forth in Section 7.4(c), the Purchasing
Parties and the Seller shall ensure that the Consents from Governmental
Entities, including any antitrust clearance by FTC, DOJ, or any state
attorney general under the HSR Act, or by the FDA or similar Governmental
Entity, are obtained as promptly as practicable, and that any reasonable
conditions set forth in or established by any such Consents are wholly
satisfied.

 

 

Section 7.5 Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality. Recognizing
the historically close relationship and interaction between the Business and
the Seller\'s retained

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

businesses, which have involved the sharing of technical, marketing,
strategic and other proprietary information (including Intellectual Property
and Commercial Know-How) over many years, and desiring to preserve the value
of the respective businesses to the Purchasing Parties and the Seller, the
Parties agree that:

 

 

(a) From the Closing Date until the date that is the fourth anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Seller agrees that it shall not, and it shall not cause
or permit its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly:

 

 

(i) develop, market or sell:

 

 

 (1) the active pharmaceutical ingredient of any of the Products;

 

 

 (2) any active pharmaceutical ingredient that has the same mechanism of
action as any active pharmaceutical ingredient of any of the Products;

 

 

 (3) any finished pharmaceutical product that (A) has the same mechanism of
action as any of the Products or (B) contains an active pharmaceutical
ingredient referred to in the foregoing clauses (1) or (2); or

 

 

 (4) any finished pharmaceutical product for the same labeled therapeutic
indication(s) as of the Closing Date as Abelcet® or Adagen® (the foregoing
clauses (1) through (4), collectively, a "Competing Business"); or

 

 

(ii) own, manage, operate, join or control, participate or invest in,
contribute, assign, transfer or license significant assets (including cash)
to, or acquire more than 5% of the capital stock or equity, or a significant
portion of the assets, of a Person that engages in a Competing Business;
provided, however, that if, following the Closing, the Seller or any of its
Affiliates intends to enter or enters into an agreement with any Person
pursuant to which such Person acquires control of all or substantially all of
the Seller\'s or such Affiliate\'s business or assets (whether such
acquisition is by means of stock or asset acquisition, merger, consolidation,
similar business combination or otherwise), the restrictions contained in
this Section 7.5(a) shall not prohibit such sale and shall not apply to any
such Person or its Affiliates; provided, however, that the Seller shall
ensure that such Person and its Affiliates do not utilize the business or
assets acquired by such Person from the Seller or such Affiliate to engage in
a Competing Business or in a manner that otherwise contravenes this Section
7.5 prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) Except as set forth in Article VIII, for a period of two years from the
Closing Date, neither the Seller nor either Purchasing Party shall, or shall
cause or permit its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent or
request of the other Party, directly or indirectly solicit for employment or
hire or attempt to hire any director, officer or employee of the other Party
or such other Party\'s Affiliates, or attempt to induce any such director,
officer or employee

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

to leave the employ of the other Party; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not prohibit the Seller or either Purchasing Party, or
any of their respective Affiliates, from hiring any person whose employment
has been terminated prior to the date of this Agreement by either the Seller
or either Purchasing Party, or any of their respective Affiliates, as the
case may be. The provisions of this Section 7.5(b) will apply whether
such officers, directors or employees are employed by the applicable Party on
the date of this Agreement or hereafter.

 

 

(c) The Seller and the Purchasing Parties agree to the following
confidentiality provisions:

 

 

(i) For a period of ten years from the Closing Date, the Seller covenants
that it shall not, and shall not cause or permit its Affiliates to, without
the prior written consent of the Purchasing Parties, make use of or otherwise
disclose to any Person information of a confidential or proprietary nature
regarding the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business (the "Purchaser
Confidential Information"), except to Representatives of the Seller or its
Affiliates who need to know such information for purposes of taxes,
accounting, pending litigation and other matters necessary in respect of (A)
the Seller\'s ownership of the Assets or (B) the Transactions, unless after
consultation with counsel, disclosure is required to be made under applicable
Law.

 

 

(ii) For a period of ten years from the Closing Date, the Purchasing Parties
covenant that they shall not, and shall not cause or permit their Affiliates
to, without the prior written consent of the Seller, make use of or otherwise
disclose to any Person information of a confidential or proprietary nature
regarding the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities (the "Seller
Confidential Information"), except to Representatives of the Purchasing
Parties or their Affiliates who need to know such information for purposes of
taxes, accounting, pending litigation and other matters necessary in respect
of the Transactions, unless after consultation with counsel, disclosure is
required to be made under applicable Law.

 

 

(iii)  Each Party acknowledges that neither the Purchaser Confidential
Information nor the Seller Confidential Information includes information that
(A) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a disclosure by the Seller or either Purchasing Party in violation of this
Agreement or (B) becomes available to the Seller or either of the Purchasing
Parties on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Purchasing
Parties or the Seller or their respective Representatives, provided that
such source is not, to the Knowledge of the Seller or the Knowledge of the
Purchasing Parties, as the case may be, a party to a confidentiality
agreement with the Seller or the Purchasing Parties or another party.

 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 7.5(c) or anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that any trade secret of
any of them shall remain subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non-
disclosure for so long as it remains a trade secret.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(d) Solely for purposes of this Section 7.5, "Affiliate" of a Party shall not
include any Person holding less than 25% of the outstanding equity interests
of such Party or any Affiliates of such Person.

 

 

(e) The Seller and the Purchasing Parties agree that the covenants contained
in this Section 7.5 are necessary for the protection of the other Party\'s
reasonable interests, are reasonable in scope, content and duration and are
in partial consideration for each Party\'s agreement to consummate
the Transactions.

 

 

(f) If it is ever held that the provisions of this Section 7.5 are too
onerous in scope or duration or are not necessary for the protection of the
Parties, each Party agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may
impose lesser restrictions that such court may consider to be fair,
reasonable, necessary or appropriate to properly protect the Parties under
the circumstances.

 

 

(g) If any court determines that any of the provisions of this Section 7.5,
or any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, such provision or part
shall be revised so that it is no longer invalid or unenforceable, as the
case may be, but the remainder of this Section 7.5 will not otherwise be
affected and shall at all times be given full effect, without regard to the
invalid portions, whether revised or not revised.

 

 

(h) The Seller and the Purchasing Parties recognize and agree that the
restrictions set forth this Section 7.5 are being entered into in connection
with the sale of the Business to the Purchasing Parties and the Parties would
not be entering into this Agreement absent such restrictions and the full
commitment of each of the Seller and each Purchasing Party to abide by such
restrictions. The Seller and the Purchasing Parties recognize and acknowledge
that a breach by the Seller or either Purchasing Party of this Section 7.5
may cause irreparable harm and material loss and damage to the other Party as
to which it may not have an adequate remedy at law or in damages.
Accordingly, the Seller and the Purchasing Parties acknowledge and agree that
the issuance of temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,
specific performance or other equitable remedy shall be an appropriate remedy
for any such breach in addition to any other remedies available at law or in
equity.

 

 

Section 7.6 Subsequent Actions. In case at any time after the Closing Date
any further action is necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, each Party shall take, and shall cause its proper
officers and directors to take, as soon as is reasonably practicable, all
such necessary, proper or advisable actions.

 

 

Section 7.7 Taxes.

 

 

(a) The Seller shall be liable for, and shall timely pay, any and all
Transfer Taxes and similar Taxes, fees, and costs together with any interest
thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees, additions to tax or additional
amounts with respect thereto incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions, regardless of who may be liable
therefore under applicable Law. The Seller shall, at its own expense,
properly complete, sign, and timely file any and all required Tax Returns
with respect to such taxes (the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

"Transfer Tax Returns") and, if required by applicable Law, the Purchasing
Parties will join in the execution of any such Transfer Tax Returns.

 

 

(b) Each of the Purchasing Parties and the Seller shall provide the other
with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the other party in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to liability for Taxes with respect to the Business,
Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities, and each will retain
and provide the requesting party with any records or information which may be
relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceedings or determination.
Any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.7(b) or pursuant to any
other Section hereof providing for the sharing of information or review of
any Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes shall be kept confidential
by the Parties.

 

 

(c) The Seller and its Affiliates agree, from and after the date of this
Agreement and until the Closing Date, to (i) prepare all Tax Returns relating
to the Business or the Assets in a manner that is consistent with the past
practices of the Seller and each such Affiliate, as the case may be, with
respect to the treatment of items on such Tax Returns except to the extent
that any inconsistency would not or may not materially increase either
Purchasing Party\'s liability for Taxes for any period; (ii) refrain from
incurring any material liability for Taxes relating to the Business or the
Assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) refrain from
entering into any settlement or closing agreement with a taxing authority
that increases or may increase the Tax liability of the Seller or such
Affiliate relating to the Business or the Assets for any period without the
consent of the Purchasing Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

Section 7.8 Financing.

 

 

(a) Sigma-Tau shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Commitment Letter; (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable to Sigma-Tau (including with
respect to the conditionality thereof) than the terms and conditions in the
Commitment Letter); (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable
to it and its Affiliates, if any, in such definitive agreements that are
within its or its Affiliates, if applicable, control; (iv) upon satisfaction
of such conditions (and all of the other conditions contained in Section 9.1
and Section 9.2 (other than Section 9.2(d)), consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing, accept the funds comprising the Financing and transfer
such funds (whether by contribution or loan or otherwise) to the Purchasing
Parties; and (v) comply with its obligations set forth in the Commitment
Letter. Sigma-Tau shall keep the Seller informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of the Financing and shall
promptly provide to the Seller appropriate notice when the definitive binding
documents related to the Financing have been executed (which notice will
include reasonable detail regarding any terms to the Financing that are
inconsistent with those contained in the Commitment Letter). Sigma-Tau shall
have the right from time to time to enter into any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of, waive any of its rights under, or
terminate, the Commitment Letter (other than with respect to the conditions
thereto), substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of
the Financing from the same and/or alternate funding sources (on terms no
less favorable to Sigma-Tau with respect to the conditionality thereof), or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

reduce the amount of the Financing, in any case in its reasonable discretion,
but only if such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of,
waiver of any provision contained in, or termination of, the Commitment
Letter, substitution of other financing or reduction of the Financing does
not, and would not reasonably be expected to, prevent or delay the Closing or
add any additional or greater conditionality to the funding of
the Financing. Sigma-Tau shall keep the Seller informed on a prompt
basis and in reasonable detail if it takes any of the actions referred to in
the preceding sentence. Sigma-Tau shall give the Seller prompt notice of any
termination of the Commitment Letter.

 

 

(b) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, the Purchasing Parties
shall (i) immediately notify the Seller and (ii) use, as promptly as
practicable, their commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources, on terms and conditions that
are customary and commercially reasonable, in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions in a timely manner.

 

 

(c) The Seller shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its and their
respective Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested
by Sigma-Tau or the Purchasing Parties in connection with the Financing or
any replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing, including (i)
providing accurate information, including financial information, relating to
the Business to the extent reasonably requested by Sigma-Tau or the
Purchasing Parties to assist in the preparation of customary information
documents to be used for the completion of the Financing as contemplated by
the Commitment Letter, (ii) using its reasonable best efforts, as
appropriate, to have its independent accountants provide their reasonable
cooperation and assistance, and (iii) cooperating reasonably with the
relevant financing parties\' due diligence, to the extent customary and
reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with the Business
or the Seller\'s other businesses.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sigma-Tau and
the Purchasing Parties acknowledge and agree that the Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall not have any
responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person under, the
Commitment Letter, the Financing or any other financing that the Purchasing
Parties may raise in connection with the Transactions, and that the
Purchasing Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing, including
pursuant to Section 7.8(c), and any information utilized in connection
therewith, except, in any case, to the extent that any information provided
by the Seller and its controlled Affiliates (other than any projections or
other "forward looking" information) contains any untrue statement by the
Seller or omits to state any material fact necessary to make any statement
therein not misleading, it being understood that the Seller makes no
representation or warranty (other than as explicitly set forth in this
Agreement) with respect to any information it provides pursuant to this
Section 7.8.

 

 

(e) In the event that the Commitment Letter is amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, including if Sigma-Tau or the Purchasing
Parties substitute

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

other debt or equity financing for all or a portion of the Financing, each
of Sigma-Tau, the Purchasing Parties and the Seller shall comply with
its respective covenants in this Section 7.8 with respect to the Commitment
Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with
respect to such other debt or equity financing to the same extent that Sigma-
Tau, the Purchasing Parties and the Seller would have been obligated to
comply with respect to the Financing, and the Financing shall be deemed to
refer to the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified and to such other financing, as applicable.

 

 

Section 7.9 Mail and Payments Received After Closing. Following the Closing,
the Purchasing Parties shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Seller
all mail and payments received by them or the Business after the Closing that
pursuant to this Agreement belong to the Seller or any of its Affiliates.
Additionally, following the Closing, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Purchasing Parties all mail and payments received by the
Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing that pursuant to this Agreement
belong to the Purchasing Parties.

 

 

Section 7.10 Post-Closing Access to Records and Personnel.

 

 

(a) After the Closing, each Party shall retain all books, records, documents,
instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other
papers relating to the Business and the Assets in their respective possession
for at least seven years or for such longer period of time set forth in their
respective records retention policies on the Closing Date or as may be
required by Law or any order.

 

 

(b) After the Closing, the Parties shall allow each other reasonable access
to and use of the Books and Records, and to personnel having knowledge of the
whereabouts or contents of the Books and Records, for legitimate business
reasons, such as the preparation of Tax Returns or the prosecution or defense
of Legal Proceedings or access to information relating to the Excluded Assets
or Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Purchasing Parties and their Affiliates shall not be
entitled to any information regarding, or a copy of, any consolidated,
combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return that includes that of the Seller
and its Affiliates.

 

 

Section 7.11 Third Party Consents.

 

 

(a) The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and the
Purchasing Parties shall assist the Seller in its efforts, to obtain all
third party Consents required to assign or transfer the Assets to the
Purchasing Parties pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In
connection with seeking such Consents, the Seller shall keep the Purchasing
Parties informed of all material developments and shall, at either Purchasing
Party\'s request, include such Purchasing Party in any discussions or
communications with any parties whose Consent is sought hereunder. Such
Consents shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Purchasing Parties.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not be obligated to pay, and the
Seller shall not pay, any fees or penalties to any Person in connection with
obtaining any third party Consent.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(b) To the extent that (i) any Asset requires the Consent of a third Person
to assign or transfer such Asset to the applicable Purchasing Party and such
Consent has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) any
Asset is not, by its terms or under applicable Law, assignable and
transferable to the applicable Purchasing Party (in either case, a "Non-
Assignable Asset"), this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or
transfer or attempted assignment or transfer thereof, unless and until, in
the case of assignments requiring Consent, such Consent shall have
been obtained. The Seller shall hold or cause to be held each such Non-
Assignable Asset, as of and from the Closing Date, in trust for the
benefit of the applicable Purchasing Party and the covenants and obligations
thereunder shall be performed by such Purchasing Party in the name of the
Seller or the applicable Affiliate of the Seller, as the case may be, and all
benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for the account of such
Purchasing Party. The Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, as of
and from the Closing Date, authorizes the applicable Purchasing Party, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable
Assets, at such Purchasing Party\'s expense, to perform all the obligations
and receive all the benefits of the Seller or its Affiliates under the terms
of the Non-Assignable Assets. The Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions in the name of
the applicable Purchasing Party as such Purchasing Party may reasonably
request to (x) provide such Purchasing Party with the benefits of the Non-
Assignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under the Non-Assignable Assets, and the Seller
shall promptly pay or cause to be promptly paid over to such Purchasing Party
all money or other consideration received by the Seller or such Affiliate in
respect of the Non-Assignable Assets and (y) enforce, at the request of such
Purchasing Party, and at the expense and for the account of such Purchasing
Party, any rights of the Seller or the applicable Affiliate of the Seller
arising from such Non-Assignable Assets against the other party or parties
thereto (including the right to elect to terminate any such Non-Assignable
Asset in accordance with the terms thereof). The Seller shall not take any
action (unless requested in writing by the applicable Purchasing Party or
required by applicable Law) that would limit or restrict or terminate the
benefits to such Purchasing Party of any Non-Assignable Asset. With respect
to any Non-Assignable Asset as to which the necessary Consent for the
assignment or transfer to the applicable Purchasing Party is obtained
following the Closing, the Seller, as soon as reasonably practicable
following receipt of such Consent, shall transfer such Non-Assignable Asset
to such Purchasing Party by execution and delivery of an instrument of
conveyance reasonably satisfactory to such Purchasing Party. With respect to
any Permit that cannot be assigned or transferred to the applicable
Purchasing Party, the Seller agrees to file such applications, notices,
certifications, reports or other information as shall be necessary to convey
the benefits of each such Permit to such Purchasing Party on and following
the Closing Date, or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date
if such conveyance cannot by Law by accomplished before or as of Closing.

 

 

Section 7.12 "As Is" Condition. Except as may be specifically provided in
this Agreement, including the representations and warranties of the Seller
contained herein and any certificate or Schedule contemplated hereby
and delivered by the Seller in connection herewith, the Purchasing Parties
expressly understand and agree that they shall accept the sale and transfer
by the Seller of all of the Assets on an "As Is Where Is" basis on the
Closing Date regardless of the condition of the Assets and whether the
Purchasing Parties have inspected and examined them. EXCEPT AS MAY BE
SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

VALUE, CONDITION OR USE OF THE ASSETS, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR USE OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROJECTIONS.

 

 

Section 7.13 Ancillary Agreements. At the Closing, the Purchasing Parties
and the Seller shall execute and deliver the following Ancillary Agreements:
(a) the Patent Assignment, (b) the Trademark Assignment, (c) the Assumption
Agreement, (d) the Transition Services Agreement, and (e) the
License Agreement.

 

 

Section 7.14 Use of Enzon Name and Supplies.

 

 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement gives the Purchasing Parties any rights to the
ownership or use of the Enzon Mark and Logo, other than the rights to use the
Enzon Mark and Logo expressly set forth in this Section 7.14(a). Following
the Closing, the Purchasing Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days following the
Closing Date, cease to, and obtain all Consents required to enable them to
cease to (i) make any use of the Enzon Mark and Logo, and (ii) hold
themselves out as having any affiliation with the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, other than as required by applicable Law. In furtherance thereof,
as soon as practicable but in no event later than 60 days following
the Closing Date, the Purchasing Parties shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all
Consents required to enable them to remove, strike over, or otherwise
obliterate the Enzon Mark and Logo from all assets and other materials owned
by the Purchasing Parties and their Affiliates, including any vehicles,
business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites, email, computer software and
other materials and systems other than as required by applicable Law. Any use
by the Purchasing Parties or any of their Affiliates of the Enzon Mark and
Logo as permitted in this Section 7.14(a) is subject to such Person\'s use of
the Enzon Mark and Logo in a form and manner, and with standards of quality,
substantially similar to (but in no event less stringent than) those in
effect for the Enzon Mark and Logo as of the Closing Date. The Purchasing
Parties and their Affiliates shall not use the Enzon Mark and Logo in a
manner that may reflect negatively on such name and marks or on the Seller or
its Affiliates. The Seller shall have the right to terminate the foregoing
license, effective upon 30 days written notice to the Purchasing Parties, if
the Purchasing Parties or their Affiliates fail to comply with the foregoing
terms and conditions or otherwise fail to comply with any reasonable
direction of the Seller in relation to the use of the Enzon Mark and Logo,
and do not cure such failure to the Seller\'s reasonable satisfaction within
30 days after such notice is provided to the Purchasing Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchasing
Parties and their Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and
any of its Affiliates for any and all Losses arising from or relating to any
use by the Purchasing Parties or any of their Affiliates of the Enzon Mark
and Logo in violation of this Section 7.14(a).

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.14(a), the
Purchasing Parties shall be entitled to use, sell and distribute (i) any of
the Products containing the Enzon Mark and Logo that are held in the
Inventory on the Closing Date, but only for an amount of time following the
Closing reasonably necessary to sell all of such Products, and (ii) any
promotional materials in the possession of the Business on the Closing Date
for up to 180 days following the Closing Date.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Section 7.15 Publicity. Prior to the Closing Date, neither Party shall, nor
shall they permit their respective Affiliates or Representatives to, issue
any press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions without first
consulting with the other Party, unless such release or statements are
reasonably determined to be required by applicable Law or the rules of any
applicable stock exchange. Any press release or public statement issued by
one Party may be simultaneously issued by the other Parties. Following the
Closing, the Parties shall mutually agree on any public announcements made by
either Party in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and
the Transactions.

 

 

Section 7.16 Maintenance of Existence; No Distributions. From the date of
this Agreement until the latest of the dates on which the Ancillary
Agreements are terminated, the Seller agrees to remain in existence and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and agrees not to take,
or cause or permit to be taken, any action that could result in the
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Seller. From the Closing Date
until the first anniversary thereof, the Seller shall maintain $45,000,000 in
cash or cash equivalents in its bank accounts; provided, however, that, if,
as of the date that is six months following the Closing, all bona fide
unresolved indemnification claims made by the Purchasing Parties pursuant to
Article XI are for an aggregate amount of less than $15,000,000, the Seller
shall only have to maintain $30,000,000 in cash and cash equivalents from and
after such date; provided, further that if, as of the date that is nine
months following the Closing, all bona fide unresolved indemnification
claims made by the Purchasing Parties pursuant to Article XI are for an
aggregate amount of less than $10,000,000, the Seller shall only have to
maintain $15,000,000 in cash and cash equivalents from and after such date
until the first anniversary of the Closing.

 

 

Section 7.17 Shared Contracts.

 

 

(a) The Purchasing Parties and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause certain Contracts that are primarily but not exclusively
related to the Business and are set forth on Schedule 7.17(a) (the "Shared
Contracts") to be split into separate contracts between the appropriate third
party and the Seller (with respect to the portion of the Shared Contracts
that does not relate to the Business) or the applicable Purchasing Party
(with respect to the portion of the Shared Contracts that relates to the
Business). The Seller and the Purchasing Parties agree to cooperate and
provide reasonable assistance prior to and for a period of six months
following the Closing to effect such separation. In the event and to the
extent that the Purchasing Parties and the Seller are unable to obtain any
Consent or amendment required to separate the Shared Contracts, (i) the
Seller and the applicable Purchasing Party shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts in good faith to separate such Shared Contracts as
promptly as practicable and (ii) if such separation is not obtained, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to effect any
lawful arrangement designed to provide for such Purchasing Party the benefits
after Closing that it would have received, and to subject such Purchasing
Party directly to the Liabilities thereunder, as if such Shared Contracts had
been separated and acquired by such Purchasing Party as an Asset.

 

 

(b) With respect to those Shared Contracts set forth on Schedule 7.17(b),
upon the reasonable request of the Purchasing Parties, the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or assign upon request such Shared
Contracts on behalf of the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

Purchasing Parties against the other parties thereto in accordance with
their terms. The Purchasing Parties shall reimburse the Seller for
all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Seller in complying with this Section 7.17(b).

 

 

Section 7.18 Proxy Statement.

 

 

(a) Covenants of the Seller with Respect to the Proxy Statement. As promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Seller

the Seller or any of its Affiliates to be included in the Proxy Statement
will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or
supplements thereto, or at the time of the Stockholders\' Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(d) Mailing of Proxy Statement; Amendments. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC, the Seller

inform the other. The Seller and each Purchasing Party each agree to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement that shall have
become false or misleading. All documents that the Seller and

shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of the Transactions (the "Stockholders\' Meeting"), and the Seller
shall hold the Stockholders\' Meeting. At the Stockholders\' Meeting, the

(the "Seller Recommendation"); provided, however, that the Seller shall not
be obligated to recommend to its stockholders the approval of the

the Seller makes a Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 7.20(c).

 

 

Section 7.20 No Solicitation of Competing Proposal.

 

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.1, and except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement, the Seller agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall,
and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any Competing Proposal, (ii)
participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
material nonpublic information with respect to, any Competing Proposal, (iii)
engage in discussions with any person with respect to any Competing Proposal,
(iv) approve or recommend any Competing Proposal or (v) enter into any letter
of intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for
any Competing Proposal. The Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussion or negotiation with any Persons that commenced
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Competing Proposal
and shall promptly request the return or destruction of all information
provided by or on behalf of the Seller or its Affiliates to such Person to
the extent that the Seller is entitled to have such information returned or
destroyed.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 7.20(a), if the
Seller receives an unsolicited Competing Proposal that the Board of Directors
of the Seller determines, in good faith, after consultation with the
Seller\'s outside legal and financial advisors, (i) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
the Seller may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information
to the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the Seller receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement with terms that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable to the Seller than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party
with respect to the Competing Proposal; provided, however, that as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the Seller taking such actions
as described in clauses (x) and (y) above, the Seller shall (A) provide
written notice to the Purchasing Parties of such Competing Proposal and (B)
provide to the Purchasing Parties any information provided to such third
party that was not previously provided to the Purchasing Parties.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 7.20(a), if the
Board of Directors of the Seller has concluded in good faith after
consultation with the Seller\'s outside legal and financial advisors that (i)
a Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of
the Board of Directors of the Seller to change, qualify, withhold or withdraw
the Seller Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Seller\'s
stockholders under applicable Law, then, in either case, the Board of
Directors of the Seller may change, qualify, withhold or withdraw the Seller
Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Purchasing Parties (a "Change
of Recommendation"), provided that, prior to making its Change of
Recommendation, (i) the Seller shall have given the Purchasing Parties at
least four Business Days written notice of its proposed Change of
Recommendation, the reasons therefor and the terms of the Superior Proposal
at issue, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Seller shall have taken into
account any revised proposal made by the Purchasing Parties to the Seller
following such four Business Days notice and shall have again concluded in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal and financial
advisors to make such Change of Recommendation. Following such affirmation
of such Change of Recommendation, the Board of Directors of the Seller may
cause the Seller or any of its Affiliates to enter into a binding written
agreement with respect to the applicable Superior Proposal (a "Superior
Proposal Agreement") and terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.1(h).

 

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Seller or the
Board of Directors of the Seller from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board
of Directors of the Seller has reasonably determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with any applicable Law; provided, that disclosures under this
Section 7.20(d) shall not be a basis, in themselves, for the Purchasing
Parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(f), but such
disclosures shall not otherwise affect the rights of the Purchasing Parties
contained in this Agreement.

 

 

(e) The Seller shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after
receipt) notify the Purchasing Parties of any Competing Proposal it or any of
its Representatives receives, including in such notice the name of the
Person submitting the Competing Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of the Competing Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including term sheets and proposed
agreements) and thereafter the Seller shall keep the Purchasing Parties
informed, on a reasonably prompt and current basis (which shall be considered
in light of the circumstances of such proposal or offer

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

and the time by which the Purchasing Parties have the opportunity to
respond), of the status and terms of any such Competing Proposal (including
any amendments thereto). The Seller shall not enter into any Contract with
any Person that prohibits the Seller from complying with this
Section 7.20(e). It is understood that if the Seller receives a
Competing Proposal, upon notification to the Purchasing Parties of such
Competing Proposal it shall also disclose to the Purchasing Parties whether
or not it intends to publicly disclose such Competing Proposal and, if the
Seller does not publicly disclose such Competing Proposal (or indicate that
such Competing Proposal will be disclosed in the Proxy Statement) within five
Business Days of being requested to do so by the Purchasing Parties, then the
Purchasing Parties may publicly disclose such Competing Proposal.

 

 

Section 7.21 Transfer of Regulatory Approvals and Permits; Interim
Responsibility.

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 7.11(b), promptly after the Closing Date, the Parties
will cooperate in transferring the transferable Regulatory Approvals and
Permits used in connection with the operation of the Business as currently
conducted to the applicable Purchasing Party. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Parties will agree upon procedures to ensure a smooth transition from the
Seller to the Purchasing Parties of all of the activities required to be
undertaken by the holder of the Regulatory Approvals and Permits, including
adverse experience reporting, quarterly and annual reports to the FDA,
handling and tracking of complaints, sample tracking, and communication with
health care professionals and customers. The Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the cooperation of the distributors
and licensees of the Products. The Purchasing Parties shall be responsible
for any expense associated with the transactions contemplated by this Section
7.21, and the Seller shall not have any Liability for the failure to obtain
the transfer of any such Regulatory Approval or Permit.

 

 

(b) Until the Regulatory Approvals and Permits shall have been transferred to
the Purchasing Parties, the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain all such Regulatory Approvals and Permits in the ordinary course of
its business consistent with past practice. After such transfer, the
applicable Purchasing Party shall assume all responsibility for the
Regulatory Approvals and Permits. Each Party shall cooperate with the other
in making and maintaining all regulatory filings that may be necessary in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 7.22 Communication With Agencies. Until the transferable Regulatory
Approvals and Permits are transferred to the Purchasing Parties, the Seller
shall have responsibility for all communications with the FDA and other
applicable Governmental Entities relating to the Products; provided that
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek the input of
the Purchasing Parties prior to making such communications. The Seller shall
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to the Purchasing Parties
copies of all communications to or from the FDA and other
applicable Governmental Entities with respect to each Product and/or the
manufacture thereof. After the Regulatory Approvals and Permits transfer has
been completed, the applicable Purchasing Party shall have responsibility for
all such communication and the Seller shall promptly (and in any event within
48 hours) provide to Purchasing Parties copies of any communication or
contact it receives from the FDA and any other Governmental Entity concerning
the Products.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Section 7.23 Promotion and Marketing. Promptly after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall file with the FDA a notice that the applicable Purchasing Party
is the marketer and distributor of the Products. To the extent that the FDA
requests additional information or meetings regarding the Purchasing
Parties\' responsibilities as marketers and distributors of the Products, the
Purchasing Parties shall respond to the FDA at their own expense and through
their own personnel.

 

 

Section 7.24 Efforts Related to Milestone Payments.

 

 

(a) Following the Closing, Defiante shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates
to use, Applicable Efforts to (i) pursue, in a reasonably timely manner, the
development and approval of SS Oncaspar and SC Oncaspar and (ii) implement
and conduct all research, development and clinical manufacturing activities
for, and regulatory activities with respect to, SS Oncaspar and SC Oncaspar
(which may include activities conducted through third parties) that are
components of or directly related to or required for the achievement of the
milestone payments contemplated by Section 3.3.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall not file any "Supplement--Change
Being Effected in 30 Days" applications with the FDA with respect to the
Products without (i) delivering a complete and accurate copy of each such
application to Defiante not less than 10 Business Days prior to any such
filing and (ii) obtaining Defiante\'s prior written approval of the contents
of such application and its filing (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

 

Section 7.25 Supplemental Information. From the date of this Agreement until
the Closing, each Party shall give prompt written notice to the other Parties
of any matter, event, fact or occurrence first arising after the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or
warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect if such representation or warranty had been made at
the time such item arose. Each such item shall be set forth on Schedule
7.25 (which Schedule shall be updated by the Purchasing Parties and/or the
Seller, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Closing) and each such
item shall be deemed an Excluded Liability or Assumed Liability, as
applicable, in respect of which the Purchasing Parties or the Seller, as
applicable, may assert a claim for indemnification in accordance with the
terms and conditions of Article XI, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
11.2(b)(iv).

 

 

Section 7.26 Production of Witnesses and Individuals. From and after the
Closing Date, the Seller and the Purchasing Parties shall use, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to
make available to each other, upon written request, its Representatives for
fact finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that
any such Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Legal
Proceeding in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved
relating to the Business. The Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchasing
Parties, on the other hand, agree to reimburse each other for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses (other than officers\' or employees\' salaries) incurred
by the other in connection with providing individuals and witnesses pursuant
to this Section 7.26. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
Section 7.26 shall not apply to Legal

Proceedings brought between the Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Purchasing Parties and their Affiliates, on the other hand.

 

 

Section 7.27 Real Property.

 

 

(a) The Seller shall:

 

 

(i) at or prior to the Closing, pay such amounts sufficient to discharge and
remove of record all Voluntary Exceptions that may be satisfied by the
payment of money, including those that reflect fines or penalties assessed by
any applicable Governmental Entity, it being agreed by the Parties that the
Seller may use a portion of the Cash Purchase Price at the Closing to cure or
correct any such Voluntary Exceptions; and

 

 

(ii) at or prior to the Closing, deliver the Deed, corporate authority
documents and such other documents as may be reasonably and customarily
required by the Title Company to effectuate the conveyance of the Owned Real
Property, and, at Klee\'s request, an owner\'s affidavit and a limited
indemnity in favor of the Title Company (which indemnity shall be for any
matters filed with the Office of the Recorder of Marion County, Indiana prior
to the Closing Date, but not recorded until after the Closing Date (but prior
to the recording of the Deed)) in order to cooperate with Klee\'s effort to
receive, at its expense, a 2006 ALTA Owner\'s Title Insurance Policy issued
by the Title Company in form reasonably acceptable to Klee insuring Klee\'s
fee simple title to the Owned Real Property as of the Closing Date in the
amount of the Cash Purchase Price allocated by the Parties to the Owned Real
Property pursuant to Section 3.5. Klee shall separately order, at its
expense, a survey for the Owned Real Property (the "Survey") certified to
Klee.

 

 

(b) If the Title Commitment reveals any material defects in title,
including Encumbrances (other than Permitted Exceptions) and Voluntary
Exceptions, or if the Survey reveals any material encroachments, material
setback violations (not otherwise permitted or grandfathered under applicable
Law) or material boundary issues, then, if Klee has provided written
notification to the Seller of each specific defect no later than ten days
after the date of this Agreement, the Seller shall diligently work to cure
and correct such title or survey defects specified; provided, however, that
any matter for which Klee fails to timely deliver such notice of defect shall
be deemed a Permitted Exception.

TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES

 

 

Section 8.1 Hiring of Employees.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Klee may offer employment to (i) any Business
Employee employed at the Facility, (ii) any Business Employee engaging in
sales and/or marketing and (iii) the other Business Employees mutually agreed
to by the Seller (in each case including (A) those Business Employees
receiving salary continuation benefits under

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

the Seller\'s short-term disability or salary continuation program and
active Business Employees on military leave or other approved absences, and
(B) employees absent from work pursuant to vacation, sick leave or other
leave, including leave granted or required to be granted under the terms of
the Family and Medical Leave Act, provided that in the case of an employee
described in clause (A) or (B), such employee is reasonably expected by the
Seller to return to active service) on terms and conditions that are
competitive in terms of base salary and primarily taking into account
the policies of Klee\'s United States Affiliates. All such
Business Employees who accept Klee\'s offer of employment shall become
Klee\'s employees as of the Closing Date (the "Transferred Employees"). If a
Business Employee retires or terminates employment with the Seller and is
subsequently hired by Klee within 180 days of the Closing Date, he or she
shall be treated as a Transferred Employee.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, at its sole cost and expense, the Seller shall take
all actions necessary to comply with all appropriate legal requirements in
connection with the Seller\'s employment of its employees, including any
legal requirements under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act.

 

 

(c) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that neither Purchasing Party assumes
or agrees to discharge any Liability of the Seller under COBRA with respect
to any current or former employees of the Seller other than for officers or
employees who would constitute Transferred Employees.

 

 

Section 8.2 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

 

(a) For a period of not less than one year following the Closing Date, Klee
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the Transferred Employees
with compensation opportunities (including incentive opportunities but
excluding any equity incentives) and employee benefits that are competitive,
taking into account the policies of Klee\'s U.S. Affiliates. To the extent
that a Transferred Employee commences participation in any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement maintained by Klee or any of its Affiliates
(each such plan, program or arrangement, a "Purchaser Plan") following the
Closing Date, Klee shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the applicable
Purchaser Plan to, (i) credit each Transferred Employee\'s service with the
Seller or any Affiliate or any predecessor employers thereto, to the extent
credited under the analogous Enzon Benefit Plan, as service with Klee for all
purposes under such Purchaser Plan; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Transferred Employees be entitled to any credit to the extent that it
would result in duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service, (ii) cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations, eligibility waiting periods, active employment requirements and
requirements to show evidence of good health under such Purchaser Plan, to
the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would have
been waived or satisfied under the analogous Enzon Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, to
be waived with respect to such Transferred Employee and such individual\'s
spouse and eligible dependents who become participants in such Purchaser Plan
and (iii) give credit for or otherwise take into account under such Purchaser
Plan the out-of-pocket expenses and annual expense limitation amounts paid by
each Transferred Employee under the analogous Enzon Benefit Plan for the year
in which the Closing Date occurs.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the generality of Section 8.2(a), during the one year
period following the Closing, each Transferred Employee who is not party to
an individual agreement with Klee providing for severance pay shall be
entitled to severance pay no less favorable than those set forth on Schedule
8.2(b).

 

 

(c) Klee shall designate a Purchaser Plan that is a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan of Klee or one of its Affiliates (such plan(s), the
"Purchasers\' Savings Plan") that either (i) currently provides for the
receipt from Transferred Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as
such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code) or (ii) shall be amended
as soon as practicable following the Closing Date to provide for the receipt
from the Transferred Employees of eligible rollover distributions. As soon
as practicable following the Closing Date, (x) Klee shall provide the Seller
with such documents and other information as the Seller shall reasonably
request to assure itself that the Purchasers\' Savings Plan provides for the
receipt of eligible rollover distributions and (y) the Seller shall provide
Klee with such documents and other information as Klee or its Affiliates
shall reasonably request to assure itself or themselves that the accounts of
the Transferred Employees would be eligible rollover distributions. Each
Transferred Employee who is a participant in the Enzon 401(k) Plan shall be
given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account balance
and shall be given the opportunity to elect to "roll over" such account
balance to the Purchasers\' Savings Plan, subject to and in accordance with
the provisions of such plan(s) and applicable Law. The Seller shall provide
Klee with copies of such personnel and other records of the Seller pertaining
to the Transferred Employees and such records of any agent or representative
of the Seller pertaining to the Transferred Employees and such records of any
agent or representative of the Seller, in each case pertaining to the Enzon
401(k) Plan and as Klee may reasonably request in order to administer and
manage the accounts and assets rolled over to the Purchasers\' Savings Plan.

 

 

(d) As of the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide an accounting to Klee of
the account balances of each participant in the Seller\'s GreatWest
Healthcare Flexible Spending Accounts program (the "Flex Plan"). As of the
Closing, Klee shall assume liability for such account balances, the aggregate
amount of which shall be set forth on the Closing Working Capital Schedule
and included in the calculation of Accrued Employee Compensation, Benefits
and Other Liabilities. Klee shall continue to provide reimbursements to such
participants in accordance with the terms of the Flex Plan through the end of
2010, based on the accounting provided by the Seller and as if Klee (or its
Affiliate, where applicable) were the sponsor of the Flex Plan.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Klee shall be
solely responsible for, and shall indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates or
Representatives for, all obligations and Liabilities (including legal costs
of collection, attorneys\' fees and other costs of defense) that the Seller
and its Affiliates or Representatives may incur that arise from (i) the
hiring, employment and discharge of any Transferred Employee by Klee or any
of its Affiliates or related entities following the Closing; (ii) all
severance entitlements and other termination costs or entitlements due to or
on behalf of any Transferred Employee resulting from the termination of such
individual\'s employment by Klee following the Closing; and (iii) medical,
dental, life, disability and any other welfare benefit plans to the extent
arising out of services provided following the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Klee shall be responsible, in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Purchaser Plans,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

for (A) any medical or dental expenses incurred after the Closing Date with
respect to any Transferred Employee or dependent thereof who as of the
Closing Date is hospitalized or who has previously begun a course of
treatment that continues following the Closing Date and (B) payment of short-
term or long-term disability benefits to which Transferred Employees may
become entitled under a Purchaser Plan or as otherwise required by Law,
provided that the condition that gave rise to the salary continuation
obligation occurred following the Closing Date. The Seller shall be solely
responsible for, and shall indemnify the Purchasing Parties and their
Affiliates or Representatives for, all obligations and Liabilities (including
legal costs of collection, attorneys fees and other costs of defense) that
the Purchasing Parties and their Affiliates or Representatives may incur,
which arise from (x) the Enzon Benefit Plans, including severance obligation
under any employment agreement or severance plan, (y) any actions taken by
the Seller or any of its Affiliates or related entities with respect to the
hiring, employment and discharge of any Business Employee who is not a
Transferred Employee and (z) any actions taken by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or related entities during all periods prior to the Closing or on
the Closing Date with respect to the hiring and employment and termination of
employment by the Seller or its Affiliates or related entities of any
Transferred Employee. The Seller acknowledges that, except as set forth
in Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.2(d), no portion of the assets of any plan,
fund, program or arrangement, written or unwritten, heretofore sponsored or
maintained by the Seller or its Affiliates (and no amount attributable to any
such plan, fund, program or arrangement) shall be transferred to Klee, and
agrees that Klee shall not be required to continue any such plan, fund,
program or arrangement. The Seller shall be responsible for any and
all compensation, benefits and severance payments to any Business Employee
who is not a Transferred Employee. This Article VIII is not intended to,
and does not, create any rights or obligations to or for the benefit of
anyone other than the Purchasing Parties and the Seller.

other Parties if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before June
30, 2010 (the "Termination Date") (which date shall be extended for the
duration of any applicable review period in connection with the HSR Act, for
so long as no Party is in default under this Agreement, and all other
conditions precedent to the Closing (other than those that are satisfied by
action taken at the Closing) have been satisfied, waived or are reasonably
expected to be satisfied before the expiration of such review period) and
(ii) the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.1(b) shall not have breached in any material respect its obligations under
this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately caused the failure
to consummate the Transactions on or before such date;

 

 

(c) by either the Purchasing Parties or the Seller by written notice to the
other Party if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an Order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, and such Order
or other action shall have become final and non-appealable, provided that
the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.1(c) shall have used its reasonable best efforts (with the cooperation of
the other Party(ies)) to remove such Order or appeal diligently such other
action; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 10.1(c) shall not be available to a Party if the issuance of
such final, non-appealable Order was primarily due to the failure of such
Party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

 

(d) by either the Purchasing Parties or the Seller by written notice to the
other Party, if the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained, whether as a result of a Change of Recommendation or otherwise, at
a duly held Stockholders\' Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

 

 

(e) by the Seller, if Sigma-Tau or either Purchasing Party shall have
breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure
of a condition set forth in Section 9.3(a) or Section 9.3(b) and (ii) cannot
be cured on or before the Termination Date (as the same may be extended),
provided that the Seller shall have given the Purchasing Parties and Sigma-
Tau written notice, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination,
stating the Seller\'s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(e) and the basis for such termination; provided, however, that
if the 30 calendar day period referred to in Section 10.1(i) shall have
expired without Sigma-Tau or either of the Purchasing Parties obtaining the
Financing (or any alternate financing) and thereafter the Seller terminates
this Agreement as a result of a breach of Section 7.8(a), Section 7.8(b) or
Section 12.17, then (x) the 30 day notice referred to in this Section 10.1(e)
need not be given and the condition set forth in Section 9.2(d) shall be
irrevocably deemed to be incapable of being satisfied and (y) neither Sigma-
Tau nor either of the Purchasing Parties may assert the failure of such
condition to be satisfied as a defense (or similar defense, excuse or claim
of non-breach) in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

any Legal Proceeding by the Seller asserted against Sigma-Tau or either of
the Purchasing Parties related to a breach of Section 7.8(a), Section 7.8(b)
or Section 12.17;

 

 

(f) by the Purchasing Parties, if the Seller shall have breached or failed to
perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b) and (ii) cannot be cured on or before the
Termination Date (as the same may be extended), provided that the Purchasing
Parties shall have given the Seller written notice, delivered at least 30
days prior to such termination, stating the Purchasing Parties\' intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f) and the basis for
such termination;

 

 

(g) by the Purchasing Parties, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Seller
shall have made a Change of Recommendation, (ii) the Seller or its Board of
Directors shall have approved, recommended, or entered into a Superior
Proposal Agreement, (iii) prior to the Seller obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Vote, a tender or exchange offer with respect to the Seller
Common Stock is commenced by any third party and, within ten Business Days of
the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Board of Directors of
the Seller shall not have recommended to the Seller\'s stockholders that they
reject such tender or exchange offer; (iv) the Seller shall have failed to
make the Seller Recommendation; or (v) the Seller or its Board of Directors
publicly announces its intentions to take any of the foregoing actions in
this Section 10.1(g);

 

 

(h) by the Seller, subject to the provisions of Section 7.20(c), if the
Seller enters into a Superior Proposal Agreement; or

 

 

(i) by the Seller, if the condition precedent set forth in Section 9.2(d) is
not satisfied on or before the 30th calendar day after all of the other
conditions set forth in Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 shall have been satisfied
or waived.

 

 

Section 10.2 Termination Fee. In the event that:

 

 

(a) (i) a Competing Proposal made after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement is publicly disclosed (and prior to the termination of this
Agreement) and is not publicly withdrawn at the time of the Stockholders\'
Meeting, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Seller pursuant to Section
10.1(b) (but only if at such time the Purchasing Parties would not be
prohibited from terminating this Agreement by application of Section
10.1(b)(ii)) or by the Purchasing Parties or the Seller pursuant to Section
10.1(d) and (iii) within one year after such termination, any definitive
agreement providing for a Qualifying Transaction shall have been entered into
(and thereafter consummated) with the Person or any Affiliate thereof who
made the Competing Proposal that was existing at the time of the
Stockholders\' Meeting;

 

 

(b) this Agreement is terminated by the Purchasing Parties pursuant to
Section 10.1(g); or

 

 

(c) this Agreement is terminated by the Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(h);

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

then the Seller shall pay to Defiante a fee of $15,000,000 in cash (the
"Seller Termination Fee"), such payment to be made in the case of (x) Section
10.2(a), upon consummation of such Qualifying Transaction, or (y) Section
10.2(b) or Section 10.2(c), within two Business Days after the termination of
this Agreement, it being understood that in no event shall the Seller be
required to pay the Seller Termination Fee on more than one occasion. After
such payment is made, the Seller shall have no further liability to the
Purchasing Parties with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions. Any
such payment shall be reduced by any amount required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Law.

 

 

Section 10.3 Reverse Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated by the
Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(i), then, within two Business Days after such
termination, Defiante shall pay to the Seller a fee of $15,000,000 in cash
(the "Purchaser Termination Fee"). After such payment is made, neither
Purchasing Party nor Sigma-Tau shall have any further liability to the Seller
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions. Any such payment shall be
reduced by any amount required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Tax Law.

 

 

Section 10.4 Sole Remedy. The Purchasing Parties and the Seller agree that
the agreements contained in Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 are an integral
part of this Agreement and the Transactions and that, without such agreement,
neither Party would have entered into this Agreement. The Purchasing
Parties and the Seller further agree that neither the Purchaser Termination
Fee nor the Seller Termination Fee constitutes a penalty, but in each case is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the non-paying
Party, in the circumstances in which such amounts are payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Except in cases of
fraud, receipt of payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee (whether directly
from the Purchasing Parties or pursuant to Section 12.17) or the Seller
Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Party receiving such payment and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, general or limited
partners, managers, members, representatives or assignees, in each case
whether former, current or future (collectively, the "Related Persons"), for
any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to
be consummated. Upon payment of the Seller Termination Fee or Purchaser
Termination Fee, as the case may be, the Party paying such fee shall have no
further liability to any other Party or its Affiliates or Related Persons
hereunder, except in cases of fraud.

 

 

Section 10.5 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by any Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Parties specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination of the Transactions is
made, and there shall be no liability or obligation thereafter on the part of
the Purchasing Parties or the Seller, except that Section 5.21 (Brokers or
Finders Fee with respect to the Seller), Section 6.5 (Brokers or Finders Fee
with respect to the Purchasing Parties), Section 7.3 (Confidentiality),
Section 10.2 (Termination Fee), Section 10.3 (Reverse Termination Fee),
Section 10.4 (Sole Remedy), Section 10.5 (Effect of Termination), Article XI
and Section 12.1 (Fees and Expenses) of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and survive the termination of this Agreement; provided,
however, that, except as otherwise provided

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

in Section 10.2 or Section 10.3, as the case may be, and Section 10.4,
nothing in this Section 10.5 shall relieve the Purchasing Parties or the
Seller of any liability for any breach of this Agreement and, upon any
termination of this Agreement, the Seller or the Purchasing Parties, as the
case may be, shall be fully liable for any and all damages of the other Party
as a result of such breach.

 

 

ARTICLE XI

 

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

Section 11.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Subject
to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, including the
provisions of this Article XI, the representations and warranties of the
Parties shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Seller or the
Purchasing Parties, for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date, except
that the representation and warranties contained in (i) Section 5.13
(Environmental Matters) shall survive for a period of 24 months after the
Closing Date, (ii) Section 5.12 (Employee Benefit Plans) and Section 5.16
(Tax Matters) shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of

(Binding Agreement), Section 5.21 (Brokers or Finders), Section 6.1
(Organization), Section 6.2 (Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary
Action) and Section 6.5 (Brokers or Finders) (collectively, the
"Fundamental Representations") shall survive indefinitely; provided, however,
that claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a) or Section
11.3(a), as applicable, first asserted in writing with specificity within
such period shall not be extinguished after such period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all covenants and agreements of
the Parties that by their terms contemplate actions following the Closing
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. All other covenants and agreements of the Parties shall
not survive this Closing and shall thereupon terminate, except that claims
for indemnification in respect of any breach thereof shall survive for a
period of 12 months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a) or Section 11.3(a),
as applicable, first asserted in writing with specificity within such period
shall not be extinguished after such period.

 

 

Section 11.2 Indemnification by the Seller.

 

 

(a) In the event the Closing occurs, the Seller shall defend, indemnify and
hold the Purchasing Parties, any Affiliate of the Purchasing Parties or their
respective current or future Representatives, controlling persons, successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, "Purchaser Indemnitees") harmless from
and against and in respect of any and all actual losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, suits, proceedings, judgments, settlements and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys\' fees, incurred by any such Purchaser
Indemnitee (hereinafter "Purchaser Losses") (other than Purchaser Losses for
Taxes for which indemnification is provided pursuant to Section 11.5) arising
out of or in connection with (i) any breach by the Seller of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Article V, (ii) any breach by the
Seller of any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement, (iii) the
Excluded Assets, (iv) the Excluded Liabilities and (v) the matters set forth
on Schedule 11.2.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

77  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

(b) The foregoing obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees set forth
in Section 11.2(a) shall be subject to each of the following limitations:

 

 

(i) no indemnification for Purchaser Losses asserted against the Seller under
Section 11.2(a)(i) shall be required unless and until the cumulative amount
of such Purchaser Losses equals or exceeds $2,000,000 (the "Deductible"),
at which time the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover all
Purchaser Losses, as finally determined, in excess of $1,000,000, and in no
event shall Purchaser Losses include special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, or punitive damages, diminution in value, lost profits or lost
business opportunity, except in respect of third party claims;

 

 

(ii) the Seller\'s aggregate liability to Purchaser Indemnitees under Section
11.2(a)(i) for Purchaser Losses shall not exceed 15% of the Cash Purchase
Price in the aggregate (the "Cap");

 

 

(iii) there shall be no indemnification for the Purchaser Losses as a result
of liabilities disclosed in the Closing Working Capital Schedule; and

 

 

(iv) no claim for misrepresentation or breach of warranty or a failure to
comply with any covenant shall be made by the Purchasing Parties under this
Section 11.2 if such fact or event was disclosed by the Seller on a schedule
or certificate delivered to the Purchasing Parties at or prior to the date of
this Agreement.

 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Section
11.2(b)(i) and Section 11.2(b)(ii) shall not apply to breaches of any
Fundamental Representation made by the Seller or any representation or
warranty contained in Section 5.12, Section 5.13 or Section 5.16. The
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for breaches of
the Seller\'s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
notwithstanding whether any Representative of any such Purchaser Indemnitee
knew or had reason to know of such breach and regardless of any investigation
by such Purchaser Indemnitee or its Representatives.

 

 

(c) If the Closing occurs, the indemnity provided in this Section 11.2 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchasing Parties and the
Purchaser Indemnitees against the Seller at law or in equity for any matter
covered by Section 11.2(a), provided the Purchasing Parties shall be entitled
to specific performance under Section 12.13 for any breach by the Seller
following the Closing of any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement.

 

 

Section 11.3 Indemnification by the Purchasing Parties.

 

 

(a) In the event the Closing occurs, the Purchasing Parties shall defend,
indemnify and hold the Seller, any Affiliate of the Seller or their
respective current or future Representatives, controlling persons, successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") harmless from
and against and in respect of any and all actual losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, suits, proceedings, judgments, settlements and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys\' fees, incurred by any such Seller Indemnitee
(hereinafter the "Seller Losses" and

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

78  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

together with the Purchaser Losses, "Losses") arising out of or in
connection with (i) any breach by either Purchasing Party of any of
the representations and warranties contained in Article VI as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent they refer to an earlier date, then as of that
earlier date), (ii) any breach by either Purchasing Party of any of its
covenants or agreements in this Agreement, (iii) the ownership, operation or
use of the Business or the Assets as of and after the Closing, and (iv) the
Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

(b) The foregoing obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnities set forth in
Section 11.3(a) shall be subject to each of the following limitations:

 

 

(i) no indemnification for Seller Losses asserted against the Purchasing
Parties under Section 11.3(a)(i) shall be required unless and until the
cumulative amount of such Seller Losses equals or exceeds the Deductible, at
which time the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover all Seller
Losses, as finally determined, in excess of $1,000,000, and in no event shall
Seller Losses include special, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
punitive damages, diminution in value, lost profits or lost business
opportunity, except in respect of third party claims; and

 

 

(ii) the Purchasing Parties\' aggregate liability to Seller Indemnitees under
Section 11.3(a)(i) for Seller Losses shall not exceed the amount of the Cap.

 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Section
11.3(b)(i) and Section 11.3(b)(ii) shall not apply to breaches of any
Fundamental Representation made by the Purchasing Parties. The Seller
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for breaches of the
Purchasing Parties\' representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
notwithstanding whether any Representative of any such Seller Indemnitee knew
or had reason to know of such breach and regardless of any investigation by
such Seller Indemnitee or its Representatives.

 

 

(c) If the Closing occurs, the indemnity provided in this Section 11.3 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller and the Seller Indemnitees
against the Purchasing Parties at law or in equity for any matter covered by
Section 11.3(a) , provided the Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance under Section 12.13 for any breach by the Purchasing Parties
following the Closing of any of their respective covenants or agreements in
this Agreement.

 

 

Section 11.4 Indemnification Procedure.

 

 

(a) All claims for indemnification by a Purchaser Indemnitee or a Seller
Indemnitee (an "Indemnified Party") (except for claims for tax
indemnification, which are addressed in Section 11.5(e)) shall be asserted
and resolved as set forth in this Section 11.4. As soon as is reasonably
practicable after an Indemnified Party or any of its respective Affiliates,
Representatives, successors and permitted assigns, as the case may be,
becomes aware of any claim for which it is entitled to recover Losses under
this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall notify the other party (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing (the "Claim Notice"), which shall describe
the claim in reasonable detail and shall specify, in reasonable detail, the
facts

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

underlying the nature of the claim, the basis for indemnification and the
estimated amount of Losses under such claim. The failure of any Indemnified
Party to promptly give any Indemnifying Party such Claim Notice shall not
preclude such Indemnified Party from obtaining indemnification under this
Article XI, except to the extent that such Indemnified Party\'s failure has
materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party\'s rights or materially
increased its Liabilities hereunder.

 

 

(b) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party may
be liable to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to
be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly, but in no event more than 10 days following such
Indemnified Party\'s receipt of such claim or demand, provide the
Indemnifying Party with a Claim Notice.

 

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the personal delivery or
receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified
Party: (i) whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim or demand; and (ii) in the
case of a third party claim, whether or not it will defend the Indemnified
Party against such claim or demand. If the Indemnifying Party declines to
defend the claim or demand, then the reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a
liability of, and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party if
the Indemnifying Party does not dispute its liability or if the Indemnifying
Party does dispute its liability and the resolution of such dispute is
against the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
elects to defend the Indemnified Party, it shall notify the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it will defend and accepts its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand pursuant to
this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall defend the Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and
control such defense. If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in
any such defense, it may do so at its sole cost and expense, provided,
however, that if, in the view of counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
to defend the third party claim, an ethical or financial conflict of interest
exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the
reasonable costs and expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party will be
paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense, the Indemnified Party shall not settle a claim or demand for which
it is indemnified by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any such claim or demand on a basis that would result in the
imposition of an Order that would restrict the future activity or conduct of
the Indemnified Party, but if such consent is unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed the Indemnified Party shall be liable to the
Indemnifying Party for all additional liability or cost incurred by the
Indemnifying Party as a result thereof. The Indemnified Party will diligently
and fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, its counsel, experts and
other relevant persons in the defense of any claim or demand including
providing access, during normal business hours, to relevant facilities and to
business records and other documents, and shall permit them to consult with
the employees and counsel and other relevant persons of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable efforts to defend all
such claims.

Section 11.5 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) The Purchasing Parties shall have the sole right to control, defend,
settle, compromise or contest any Tax Contest relating to a Tax Return of the
Purchasing Parties; provided, however, that if the Seller would be required
to indemnify the Purchasing Parties for any Taxes, losses, claims or expenses
arising from a Tax Contest, and such Tax Contest relates to a Tax Return of
the Purchasing Parties, the Purchasing Parties shall (i) keep the Seller
fully and timely informed and apprised with respect to the commencement,
status and nature of such Tax Contest, (ii) provide the Seller with copies
of, and the reasonable opportunity to comment on, any submissions to any
taxing authority relating to such Tax Contest (and, if applicable, to attend,
with the Purchasing Parties, any meetings or conferences with such taxing
authority), and (iii) not settle any Tax Contest that would result in
the Seller being required to indemnify the Purchasing Parties for any Taxes,
losses, claims or expenses without the consent of the Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(b) The Seller shall be responsible and liable for the timely payment of, and
shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees for, any and all Taxes relating to
the Business or the Assets for all Pre-Closing Periods (other than those
Taxes included as Current Liabilities in the Closing Working Capital).
The Purchasing Parties shall be responsible and liable for the timely payment
of, and shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for, any and all Taxes
relating to the Business or the Assets for all taxable periods (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) All Taxes and Tax liabilities relating to the Business or the Assets that
relate to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing
Period and Post-Closing Period as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes other
than income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, on a per diem basis, and
(ii) in the case of income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, as
determined from the books and records of the Seller and its Affiliates
relating to the Business or the Assets as though the taxable year of the
Seller or any relevant Affiliate terminated at the close of business on the
Closing Date.

 

 

(d) The Seller shall terminate or cause to be terminated, on the Closing
Date, any and all of the tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar
agreements, arrangements or undertakings in effect, written or unwritten,
that (i) relate to the Business or the Assets and (ii) could give rise to any
obligation or liability for the Purchasing Parties or their Affiliates and
the successors to the foregoing (and their respective stockholders, officers,
directors, employees and agents) for any Taxes imposed by any government or
taxing authority, regardless of the period in which such Taxes are imposed,
and there shall be no continuing obligation to make any payments under any
such agreements, arrangements or undertakings.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnities (on an after-Tax basis) against (i) all Taxes, losses, claims and
expenses resulting from, arising out of, or incurred with respect to, any
claims that may be asserted by any party based upon, attributable to, or
resulting from the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in Section 2.4(f), Section 5.16 or Section 7.7; and (ii) all Taxes
relating to the Business

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

81  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

or Assets, for which any Purchaser Indemnitee may otherwise be liable, for
all Pre-Closing Periods, to the extent such Taxes are not Current Liabilities
in the Closing Working Capital.

 

 

(f) All amounts paid by the Seller to the Purchasing Parties or the
Purchasing Parties to the Seller pursuant to Section 11.5(b) and Section
11.5(e) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

 

 

Section 11.6 No Limitations for Acts of Fraud. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement, including Section 11.2 or Section 11.3, to the contrary, in
the event either the Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchasing Parties, on
the other hand, perpetrates an act of fraud on the other Party, the Party
that suffers or incurs Losses by reason thereof shall be entitled to seek
recovery therefor against the Party who perpetrated such act without regard
to any limitation set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 11.7 No Set-off. Neither the Seller, on the one hand, nor
the Purchasing Parties, on the other hand, shall have any right to set-off
any payments under this Article XI against any payments to be made by such
Party pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; provided,
however, that the Seller or either of the Purchasing Parties, as the case may
be, may, at its option (at any time and from time to time), but only after
determination by a final non-appealable judgment that amounts are owed to the
Seller or either of the Purchasing Parties, as the case may be, under this
Article XI, reduce any amount owed by the Seller or either of the Purchasing
Parties, as the case may be, under this Article XI by all or part of any
amount owed to the Seller or either of the Purchasing Parties, as the case
may be, pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; provided,
further, however, that no reduction or set-off shall be permitted with
respect to the Cash Purchase Price, including any adjustments thereto
pursuant to Section 3.4.

 

 

ARTICLE XII

 

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

 

Section 12.1 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Parties, on the

connection with the origination, negotiation and execution of this Agreement,
except that the Purchasing Parties shall pay, whether or not the Transactions
are consummated, all filing fees incurred in connection with any filing with
antitrust authorities pursuant to the HSR Act and the corresponding Laws of
other jurisdictions.

so waiving. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach.

Section 12.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by facsimile and .pdf file), each of which shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one
and the same instrument. The parties to this Agreement need not execute the
same counterpart.

 

 

Section 12.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
the Schedules and Exhibits, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements set forth the entire understanding of the Parties, and no
modifications or amendments to this Agreement shall be binding on the Parties
unless in writing and signed by the Party or Parties to be bound by such
modification or amendment. Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

84  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

create or establish any third party beneficiary hereto nor confer upon any
person not a party to this Agreement any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement, except for those third party beneficiaries set
forth in Section 11.2(a) and Section 11.3(a).

 

 

Section 12.6 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof
or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision.

 

 

Section 12.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.

 

 

Section 12.8 Enforcement; Venue. Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, or if such court does
not have jurisdiction, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, County
of New Castle, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of the Parties further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to such party\'s respective address set forth in Section 12.3 shall be
effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding with respect
to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above
in the immediately preceding sentence. The Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the Transactions in (a) the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware or (b) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, County of New
Castle, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

 

 

Section 12.9 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the
Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any
Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 12.10 Schedules and Exhibits. All Exhibits and Schedules hereto are
hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. Any
fact or item which is disclosed on any Schedule to this Agreement in such a
way as to make its relevance to a representation or warranty made elsewhere
in this Agreement or to information called for by another Schedule to this
Agreement reasonably apparent on its face shall be deemed to be an exception
to such representation or warranty, or to be disclosed on such other
Schedule, as the case may be, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or
cross reference thereto. Any fact or item disclosed on any Schedule hereto
shall not by reason only of such inclusion be deemed to be material and shall
not be employed as a point of reference in determining any standard of
materiality under this Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.11 Delivery. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the
term "delivered by the Seller," "delivered to the Purchasing Parties" or
"furnished or made available to the Purchasing Parties" or similar
expressions shall mean that the Seller has: (a) posted such materials to the
Data Room and has given the Purchasing Parties and their Representatives
access to the materials so posted, (b) set forth such materials in the
Schedules; or (c) has otherwise made such materials available in writing to
the Purchasing Parties not less than 24 hours prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.12 Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding on the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. This Agreement shall not be assigned by either Party without the
express prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempted
assignment, without such consents, shall be null and void; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, either Purchasing Party may assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate or to a purchaser
of all or substantially all of its assets or of greater than 50% of its
equity without the prior consent of the Seller.

 

 

Section 12.13 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other
remedy at law or in equity available to any Party under this Agreement,
including monetary damages. Each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of, or to enforce compliance
with, the covenants and obligations of the other Parties contained in
this Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.14 No Strict Construction. The Parties have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event
any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by all Parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE

Section 12.17 Guarantee by Sigma-Tau.

 

 

(a) Sigma-Tau represents and warrants to the Seller as follows:

 

 

(i) It is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and has all requisite
corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material nor would have a
material impact on the ability of Sigma-Tau timely to perform its obligations
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(ii) It has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations under Section 7.8(a)
and this Section 12.17. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Sigma-Tau and the performance by it of its obligations hereunder have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Sigma-Tau are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance by it of its
obligations. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Sigma-Tau
and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof and
thereof by the Purchasing Parties and the Seller, this Agreement is a valid
and binding obligation of Sigma-Tau, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms except (A) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and
(B) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
would be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

 

 

(b) Sigma-Tau unconditionally guarantees timely and complete performance by
Defiante of all of its duties and obligations contained in Section 3.3(a),
Section 3.3(b)(i), Section 3.3(b)(ii), Section 3.3(c), Section 3.3(d) and
Section 10.3, and the due and punctual payment by Defiante of any amount that
may become due and payable by it under such Sections, if and when, and
limited to the extent that, Defiante defaults under such obligations. The
Seller shall provide to Sigma-Tau (i) notice of the extent to which Defiante
has defaulted under such obligations and (ii) a demand for payment by Sigma-
Tau of the amount of such obligations, less the amount in respect thereof
that Defiante has paid to the Seller through and including the date of such
demand. Sigma-Tau shall, within 30 days of receipt of demand for

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

87  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

payment from the Seller, pay such remaining amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
the Seller. Sigma-Tau reserves the right to assert defenses that
Defiante may have to payment or performance of any obligations
guaranteed hereunder. The foregoing guarantee is a continuing guarantee
and shall remain in full force and effect for so long as any such payments
may become due and payable. Sigma-Tau waives any right to require that any
resort be had by the Seller or any Seller Indemnitees to the assets
or properties of the Purchasing Parties. The liability of Sigma-Tau shall
not be limited, diminished or affected by (i) any failure by the Seller
or any Seller Indemnitees to file or enforce any claim against the
Purchasing Parties or others (in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise), or
(ii) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge of a guarantor. Sigma-Tau hereby waives
diligence, presentment, demand of performance, protest, notice and demands
(other than as provided in this Section 12.17) in connection with the
performance of its obligations for payment under this Section 12.17. The
guarantee contemplated by this Section 12.17 shall apply regardless of any
amendments, variations, alterations, waivers or extensions to this Agreement
whether or not Sigma-Tau received notice of the same, and Sigma-Tau hereby
waives all need for notice of the same. In addition, to the extent that
either of the Purchasing Parties are required to use its commercially
reasonable efforts, pursuant to Section 7.8(b), to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from lenders other than the Lender and any such other
lender requires a guarantee by Sigma-Tau of either of the Purchasing
Parties\' obligations in connection with such alternative financing, Sigma-
Tau shall provide such a guarantee on customary terms and conditions.

 

 

(c) Sigma-Tau irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware located in Wilmington,
Delaware, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, County of New Castle, for the purposes of any suit,
action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement and applicable
to Sigma-Tau. Sigma-Tau further agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its address set forth
in Section 12.3 shall be effective service of process for any action, suit
or proceeding with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Sigma-
Tau irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement in (i)
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or (ii) the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, County of New Castle, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

 

Section 12.18 Actions by Klee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement and prior to or at the Closing, whenever this Agreement
requires Klee to take any action, that requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part Defiante to cause Klee to take that action, and
Defiante shall be liable for the non-performance of any obligation by Klee.
