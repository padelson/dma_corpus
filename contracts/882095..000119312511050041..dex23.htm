representations and warranties are not correct, Parent shall have the right to
reallocate the distribution of the Aggregate Merger Consideration among the
Participants so as to effect the intent of Sections 2.1(c) and 2.1(d) above,
but without increasing or decreasing the Aggregate Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Aggregate

right or option to repurchase such share (the " _Repurchase Option_ ") upon
the purchasers termination of employment or service with the Company or is
otherwise subject to risk of forfeiture under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other Contract shall, unless such share constitutes a
[*], be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(g)(i) below. The
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) with respect to any share of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that
constitutes a [*] shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.1(g)(ii) below.

(i) The consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) with respect to any
unvested share of Company Common Stock subject to this Section 2.1(g) that is

risk of forfeiture applicable to such share and will vest incrementally over
the record holders period of continued service with the Surviving Corporation
or Parent pursuant to the same vesting schedule in effect for such share
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Accordingly, (A) any consideration
payable for such share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(i)
shall be held by Parent and shall not be paid or otherwise delivered to the
record holder of such share until the date on which such share would have (had
the Merger not occurred) vested or as soon as administratively practicable
thereafter, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar month in
which such vesting date occurs (or, with respect to any such shares that would
vest on an accelerated basis upon the record holders separation from service
(within the meaning of Code Section 409A), the date of such separation from
service, subject to any required holdback under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the
Code), (B) any consideration payable for such share of Company Common Stock

RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

  



4  the 2.1(d)(iii) consideration (if any) with respect to such share is
released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and distributions to the Participants
are made in accordance with Section 2.1(e), and (C) subject to and contingent
upon the prior vesting of any such share, any consideration payable for such
share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(ii) shall be paid to
the record holder on the same date or dates on which the Section 2.1(d)(ii)
consideration is paid to the holders of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the provisions governing the payment of the Per Share Contingent Amount.
All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.1(g)(i) shall be subject to the
collection of all applicable withholding taxes by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no withholding taxes shall be collected with
respect to any unvested shares of Company Common Stock subject to this
Section 2.1(g)(i) as to which Parent has been provided with satisfactory
evidence of a timely filed election under Section 83(b) of the Code prior to
the Effective Time. The Companys rights with respect to each Repurchase
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically by reason of the Merger be deemed to have been assigned to
Parent upon consummation of the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by
Parent upon the same terms and conditions that were in effect for such
Repurchase Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that from
and after the Effective Time, each such Repurchase Option or forfeiture
provision shall apply to the consideration payable under Section 2.1(d) with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Repurchase
Option. At or following the Effective Time, upon the payment to the record
holder of the repurchase price per share in effect under the
applicable Repurchase Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall be deemed to have repurchased all of the consideration otherwise payable
under Section 2.1(d) with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
covered by the exercised Repurchase Option. Accordingly, upon the exercise of
any such Repurchase Option or the occurrence of any forfeiture event
pertaining to any such share of Company Common Stock at or following the
Effective Time, Parent shall succeed to the entire right, title and interest
in and to all of the consideration payable under Section 2.1(d) with respect
to such share, and the record holder shall cease to have any further right,
title or interest in and to that consideration and shall only be entitled to
the repurchase price payable under the exercised Repurchase Option, if
applicable. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all action
that may be reasonably necessary to ensure that (and Parent shall have the
right, from and after the Effective Time, to take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that): (1) the consideration payable under Section 2.1(d)
with respect to any unvested share of Company Common Stock subject to this
Section 2.1(g)(i) shall remain so unvested and subject to such Repurchase
Option or risk of forfeiture; (2) such consideration shall be paid in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1(g)(i) following
the vesting of the shares of Company Common Stock to which that consideration
pertains; and (3) Parent is entitled to exercise any such Repurchase Option or
otherwise enforce any applicable forfeiture provision in any such restricted
stock purchase agreement or other Contract. The Company shall also, prior to
the Effective Time, provide each holder of unvested shares of Company Common
Stock [*] with written notice of the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.1(g)(i) relating to the consideration payable for such shares, and the
Company shall provide Parent in advance with a draft of such notice and shall
reflect any

the holders of the unvested shares.

 

(ii) [*]

(iii) [*]

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Dissenters Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive
any cash pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d), and the holder of
Dissenters Shares shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the
DGCL.

 

(b) If a holder of Shares who demanded appraisal of such Shares under the DGCL
shall effectively withdraw, forfeit or otherwise lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal of such Shares, then, as of the
occurrence of such event (occurring after the Effective Time), and in each
case subject to and in accordance with Section 3.1, each such Share shall be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration in
the Merger that such Share would have been entitled to receive in accordance
with Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d) had such Share never been a Dissenters
Share.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of the Shares pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands and any other related instruments
received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, no holder of Dissenters Shares shall
be entitled to vote such Shares for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on such Shares. 

ARTICLE III

and each Stockholder of record of any uncertificated Shares that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares. The Transmittal
Letter shall contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and any uncertificated Shares in exchange for any applicable cash
amount payable on account of such Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section
2.1(d) to Stockholders.

 



[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY

RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

  



6 (b) Upon surrender of a Certificate or uncertificated Share to the Exchange
Agent (other than Dissenters Shares), together with the Transmittal Letter,
duly executed, and such other documents as may be required by the Exchange
Agent, following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the
holder of such Certificate or uncertificated Shares, subject to Section 3.7,
in exchange for each converted (and canceled) Share represented thereby, the
applicable cash amount payable on account of such Share pursuant to Section
2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d). 

Section 3.2 _Payments to Persons Not Named in Certificates_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any Transfer Taxes
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject
to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to no longer be outstanding and automatically be cancelled and
retired and represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable cash amount payable on account of such Share in accordance with
Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d).

Section 3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights_. The consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article III upon conversion of any Shares
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligations to pay or provide for the rights of holders of Dissenters
Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be exchanged as provided in this Article III.

Section 3.4 _Company Transfer Books; Lost Certificates_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made on the records of
the Company.

(b) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the delivery of an
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent pursuant to
which such Person agrees to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, which agreement will not require a bond or
other security in support of such indemnity obligation unless the Exchange
Agent shall reasonably require one in exchange for the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to pay any cash
to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1, all subject to and in accordance with Section 3.1.

Section 3.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar 

 



[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY

RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

  



7  Law. Subject to the previous sentence, if any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any of the consideration is payable in respect
of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body), any cash in respect of such Certificate shall be delivered
to the Surviving Corporation, and the holder of such Certificate shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for the
consideration payable with respect to the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate.

 

Section 3.6 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of equity securities
of the Company pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts (a) shall be
remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or the
Escrow Agent, as applicable, to the appropriate taxing authority and (b) shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of equity securities of the Company in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be.

 

Section 3.8 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the execution and delivery hereof
and prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall be changed into
a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon with a record date
within such period, or any similar event shall occur, the consideration
payable per Share will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend or similar event.

jurisdictions are the only jurisdictions in which the ownership or leasing of
the Companys properties or the conduct of the Companys business requires
such qualification, except where the lack of such qualification would not have
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
other jurisdiction has demanded, requested or otherwise indicated that the
Company is required to so qualify. The Company has full corporate power and
authority to own or lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as now conducted. The Company has delivered to Parent true

Companys minute books, and such minute books contain true and complete

the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Company
Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or

this Agreement by each of Parent and AcquisitionCo) is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms,
and each of the Company Ancillary Agreements has been duly authorized by the
Company and upon execution and delivery by the Company will be (assuming the
valid authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties
thereto) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
application relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
principles of equity (the " _General Exceptions_ ").

the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of each Participant. Each
Participant agrees, by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement (and without
any individual act of such Participant), that all actions taken by the

Escrow Agreement shall be binding upon such Participant and such Participants
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such

[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY

RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

  



45 (a) The Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated in accordance with the following provisions based on their
respective grant dates and their status as vested or unvested options at that
time:

(i) Each Company Option [*] that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than any Company Option described in Section 8.8(a)(ii),
shall be assumed by Parent at the Effective Time and automatically converted
into the right to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock at an adjusted
exercise price per share. Accordingly, following such assumption and
conversion, (A) each such assumed Company Option shall be exercisable solely
for shares of Parent Common Stock, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Company Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by
multiplying the number of unvested shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (C) the per share exercise price for
the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option shall
be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent, (D) any restriction on the
exercise of such Company Option shall continue in full force and effect and
the term, the vesting schedule for the shares purchasable thereunder and all
the other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged,
and (E) any repurchase right or option applicable to any unvested shares of
Parent Common Stock purchased under such Company Option shall be exercisable
by Parent as the Companys successor. It is the intention of the parties that
the Company Options so assumed by Parent qualify, to the maximum extent
permissible following the Effective Time, as incentive stock options
as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. Consistent with the terms
of the Company Stock Plan and the documents governing the outstanding Company
Options under such plan, the Merger shall not terminate any of the Company
Options assumed by Parent or accelerate the vesting of the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to those assumed options. The holders of the Company
Options so assumed shall not be entitled to any of the cash consideration
payable under Section 2.1 of this Agreement.

(ii) Each Company Option [*] that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, to the extent exercisable at that time for vested shares
of Company Common Stock, be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a
cash amount (the " _Vested Option Payment Amount_ ") determined by
multiplying (x) the number of vested shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation by (y) the dollar
amount by which the maximum consideration otherwise payable per share of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Sections 2.1(d)(i) and 2.1(d)(iii) exceeds
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock in effect under such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the
immediately following sentence. Accordingly, the holder of each such Company
Option shall be entitled to receive (A) within 30 days following the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Closing Distribution

 



[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY
BRACKETS, IS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO
RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

  



46  Ratio _multiplied by_ (2) the Vested Option Payment Amount attributable to
such Company Option, and (B) an interest in any cash released from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, as and when released to the other Participants
therefrom, to the extent provided in the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the
Vested Option Payment Amount with respect to each such Company Option that
represents the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(iii) shall be
deposited into the Indemnity Escrow Fund and shall be paid to the holder of
such vested Company Option at the same time that portion of the consideration
(if any) is released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and distributions are
made to other Participants in accordance with Section 2.1(e). All cash
payments made to the holders of the Company Options in cancellation of such
options in accordance with this Section 8.8(a)(ii) shall be subject to
the Companys collection of all applicable federal, state and local income
and employment withholding taxes.

 

(iii) [*]

(iv) [*]

(b) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall (1) take all actions
that may be necessary or that Parent considers reasonably appropriate (under
the Company Stock Plan and otherwise) to effectuate the foregoing provisions
of Section 8.8(a) and ensure that the Company Stock Plan and Company Options
can be assumed or cancelled, as the case may be, in accordance with those
provisions and (2) cause to be effected, in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, any amendments to the Company Stock Plan necessary to give
effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.8. The Company shall
also, prior to the Effective Time, provide each holder of an outstanding
Company Option with written notice of the foregoing provisions of this Section
8.8 relating to the treatment of that option hereunder, and the Company shall
provide Parent in advance with a draft of that notice and the opportunity to
comment on such notice prior to distribution to the holders of the Company
Options.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plan, to the
extent it pertains to the Company Options outstanding at that time that are
to be assumed in accordance with Sections 8.8(a)(i) above. In effecting such
assumption, the portion of the share reserve under such plan that relates to
those outstanding Company Options shall automatically be converted
into shares of Parent Common Stock by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to those outstanding Company Options by the
Option Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the next whole share of Parent Common
Stock.

 

(d) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to file, within 30
Business Days following the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor to Form S-8) so as to register the Parent Common Stock
subject to those assumed Company Options.

Section 8.9 _Closing Calculation Certificate_.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate (in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) duly executed on behalf of the Company by the Chief
Executive Officer or any Senior Vice President of the Company who is a duly
appointed and duly authorized officer of the Company (the

47  " _Estimated Closing Calculation Certificate_ ") setting forth Companys
good faith estimates of (i) the Cash Amount, (ii) the Transaction Costs,

ARTICLE IX

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 9.1 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Liability for Taxes_. Pursuant to Article XII, and solely from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, each Parent Group Member shall be indemnified and held
harmless from and against, any and all Losses and Expenses suffered, incurred
or sustained by any such Parent Group Member relating to, in connection with
or arising from (i) all Taxes imposed on the Company, or for which the Company
may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of a Company
Group (including Taxes for which the Company may be liable pursuant to Treas.
Reg. § 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or foreign Law as a
result of having been a member of a Company Group) at or prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) all Transfer Taxes imposed on the Participants,
and (iii) all Taxes imposed on the Company, or for which the Company may
otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that ends at or before the
Effective Time and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending at and including the Effective Time (including any
obligations to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a
consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to any Company Group);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Parent Group Member shall be indemnified or
held harmless from or against any such Tax liability to the extent that it is
reflected as a liability or reserve for Tax liabilities in the Balance Sheet.
For purposes of this Section 9.1(a), whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for income or sales Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period,
the determination of the Taxes of the Company for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after, the Effective Time shall be determined by assuming
that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which
ended at the Effective Time and the other which began at the Effective Time
and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by

 



[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY
BRACKETS, IS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO
RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

  



50  assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the Effective Time and
the amount of any other Taxes of the Company shall be allocated between such
two taxable years based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the portion of the year being determined and denominator of which
is the number of days in the year. In the event that Parent makes an election
under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the acquisition of the Company
hereunder, then the deemed sale by the Company of its assets pursuant to such
election shall be treated for purposes of this Section 9.1(a) as having taken
place after the Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Participants from any additional Tax recognized by such Participants solely as
a result of such election under Section 338 of the Code.

(b) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Effective Time, the Representative
and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) timely
sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to sales, transfer and similar Taxes,
(ii) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this Section
9.1, and in connection therewith, provide the other party with any necessary
powers of attorney, (iii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any
audits of, or disputes with Governmental Bodies regarding, any Tax Returns of
the Company, (iv) make available to the other and to any Governmental Body as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to
Taxes of the Company, (v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
received from any Governmental Body in connection with any Tax audit or
information request with respect to any such taxable period and (vi) cooperate
in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any Transfer Taxes.

(c) _Tax Returns_. The Company shall file or cause to be filed when due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company at or before the
Effective Time and the Company shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes
due in respect of such Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare and file or cause to
be prepared and filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company and the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time consistent
with the positions taken, elections made and methods used by the Company
in preparing Tax Returns filed in prior periods to the extent that (i) such
positions, elections and methods were permissible and in compliance with Law,
and (ii) an inconsistent position would result in a Loss or Expense for which
the Parent Group Members would be entitled to indemnity pursuant to Section
9.1(a). Parent shall permit the Representative to review each Tax Return that
covers a pre-Effective Time Tax period or any Straddle Period. The
Representative shall have 30 days to review and comment on each such Tax
Return with respect to items affecting the Tax liabilities of the Company for
which Parent Group Members are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section
9.1(a) prior to the filing thereof and Parent shall consider in good faith
such comments with respect to each such Tax Return.

(d) _Contest Provisions_.

 

(i) Parent shall notify Representative in writing upon receipt by Parent, a
Parent Group Member or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits or

 



[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY
BRACKETS, IS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO
RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

  



51  assessments which would materially affect the Tax liabilities of the Company
for which Parent Group Members are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
Section 9.1(a); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to comply with this
provision shall not affect a Parent Group Members right to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent such failure materially impairs
Representatives ability to contest any such Tax liabilities on behalf of the
Participants.

(ii) Subject to Section 9.1(d)(iii) below, the Representative shall have the
sole right to represent the interests of the Participants in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to Tax liabilities for which
Parent Group Members are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section
9.1(a) and which relate to taxable periods ending at or before the Effective
Time, and to employ counsel of the Representatives choice; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Representative shall have no right to participate in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding unless the Representative
shall have first notified Parent in writing (A) of the Representatives
intention to do so, (B) of the identity of counsel, if any, chosen by the
Representative in connection therewith, and (C) that the Representative
agrees with Parent that the Parent Group Member shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Losses and Expenses relating to Taxes that result from
such audit or proceeding subject to, and in accordance with, Article XII;
_provided_ _further_ , that Parent and its representatives shall be permitted,
at Parents expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or
proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect the liability for
Taxes of any Parent Group Member, the Company or any Affiliate thereof for
any period after the Effective Time to any extent without the prior written
consent of Parent.

 

(iii) Parent shall have the sole right to represent the Surviving
Corporations interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to Tax liabilities other than those for which the
Representative has such right pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) and to employ
counsel of Parents choice at Parents expense. Parent shall have the sole
right to defend the Surviving Corporation with respect to any issue arising in
connection with any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding to the
extent Parent shall have agreed in writing to forego any indemnification under
this Agreement with respect to such issue.

(iv) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Parent any obligation to
defend the Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding, but
Parent shall assist the Representative to the extent it is necessary to allow
the Representative to initiate a defense of the Company in any Tax audit
or legal proceeding.

Section 9.2 _Transferred Employees_.

 

(a) With respect to Transferred Employees, in the event that Parent
transitions any such Transferred Employees to benefit plans, programs or
arrangements of Parent or any of

provide any assistance and information (including initial employment
dates, termination dates, reemployment dates, hours of service, compensation
and Tax withholding history in a form that shall be usable by Parent) as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the foregoing, and such
information shall be true and correct in all material respects.

or representatives shall make any communication to any employee or
independent contractor regarding any compensation or benefits to be provided
after the Effective Time without the advance written approval of Parent.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement (i) is
intended to create an employment related contract between Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and any employee nor may any current or former employee
rely on this Agreement as the basis for any breach of any employment
related contract claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (ii)
shall be deemed or construed to require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
continue to employ any particular employee for any period after the Effective
Time, (iii) shall be deemed or construed to limit the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any employee at any time
after the Effective Time, (iv) shall be construed as establishing or amending
any Company Benefit Plan, Contract or any other employment, compensation or
employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement or (v) is intended to
create any rights or obligations except between the parties to this Agreement
and no current or former employee, no beneficiary or dependent thereof, and
no other person who is not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to
assert any claims hereunder.

(e) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
contingent on the Closing, the Company shall take all necessary actions to
terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). The
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has
been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date and contingent on the Closing) pursuant to resolutions of the Companys
board of directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating such other Company Benefit Plans
as Parent may reasonably require.

in to the Indemnity Escrow Fund on behalf of such Participant).

(b) The indemnification provided for in this Section 12.1 shall terminate [*]
after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any Parent Group Member

continue as to any claim of which any Parent Group Member has notified the
Representative in accordance with the requirements of Section 12.2 on or prior

been reimbursed for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in accordance
with this Article XII.

Section 12.1(b) shall not apply in the case of fraud or intentional

determining whether the Basket Amount has been satisfied, for the purpose of
determining whether a breach has occurred and for the purpose of calculating
Losses; and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in or made by or pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Identified
Representations), all materiality qualifiers (such as "materiality,"
"material" and "Material Adverse Effect") shall be disregarded and not given
any effect for all purposes in connection with Article XII (including for the
purpose of determining whether the Basket Amount has been satisfied and for
the purpose of calculating Losses) other than for purposes of determining

shall thereupon cease.

Section 12.2 _Notice of Claims_.

 

(a) Any Parent Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to
the Representative prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any other Contract, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based. A
Claim Notice in respect of any Action by or against a Person that is not (i)
a party to this Agreement or (ii) a Parent Group Member (each, a " _Third
Person_ ") as to which indemnification will be sought (each, a " _Third-Person
Claim_ ") shall be given within a reasonable period of time after Parent
obtains actual knowledge of such Action. The failure of any Parent Group
Member seeking indemnification hereunder (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to
give the Claim Notice to the Representative within a reasonable period of
time as required by this Section 12.2 shall not affect such Indemnified
Partys rights under this Article XII except to the extent such failure is
actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of the Participants. 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article XII shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Representative; (ii) by a final judgment or decree
of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by an Award. The judgment or
decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any,
shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals
taken shall have been finally determined.

 

(c) If any Claim Notice, written agreement between the Indemnified Party and
the Representative, final judgment or decree of any court or any Award is
delivered to a party pursuant to this Section 12.2, a copy of such Claim
Notice, written agreement, final judgment or decree or Award shall be
delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent. Upon the determination of any amount
of indemnification payable to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
12.2(b), if cash remains in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Indemnified Party
and the Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to act in
accordance with such written agreement, final judgment or decree or Award and
distribute cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

limiting the effect of Section 12.1(e), this Article XII shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy for breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein, or otherwise in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto hereby waive, from

parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. The successors and
permitted assigns hereunder shall include, in the case of Parent, any
permitted assignee as well as the successors in interest to such permitted

Section 14.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_.

(a) This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein, and the

(b) This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a

requires consent of the Stockholders shall be effective only to the extent
such Stockholder approval has been obtained for such amendment or waiver (with
it being understood and agreed that, to the maximum extent permitted under
the DGCL, any amendment or waiver of this Agreement shall be effective without
the requirement that such Stockholder approval for such amendment or waiver be
obtained). No course of dealing between or among any Persons having
any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or
discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any
Person under or by reason of this Agreement.

66  to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement
to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. Titles to
Articles and headings of Sections are inserted for convenience of reference
only and shall not be deemed a part of or to affect meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. This Agreement and the Company Ancillary Agreements shall
be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction
or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted.

 

Section 14.6 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party or parties. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right
of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of
any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any
other or subsequent breach.

Section 14.7  _Expenses_. Subject to giving effect to the deduction of the
Unpaid Cost Amount from the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration, each of
the parties hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other
financial, legal, accounting or other advisors), incurred by it or its
Affiliates in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and each of the other documents
and instruments executed in connection with or contemplated by this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
the process relating to the sale of the Company, including, in the case
of the Company, the cost of the DandO Insurance purchased by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.3 (collectively, the " _Transaction Costs_ ").

Section 14.8 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained
herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to
the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.

 

Section 14.9 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to each of the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission or PDF by electronic transmission shall be effective
delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.
