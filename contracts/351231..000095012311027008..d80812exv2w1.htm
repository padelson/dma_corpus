</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, qualified persons are reluctant to serve organizations as directors or officers or in
other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection against risks of claims and
actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of such
organizations;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties hereto recognize that the legal risks and potential liabilities, and the
threat thereof, associated with lawsuits filed against persons serving the Company and/or its
subsidiaries, and the resultant substantial time, expense and anxiety spent and endured in
defending lawsuits bears no reasonable relationship to the compensation received by such persons,
and thus poses a significant deterrent and increased reluctance on the part of experienced and
capable individuals to serve the Company and/or its subsidiaries;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the uncertainties related to obtaining adequate insurance and indemnification have
increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Chapter&nbsp;8 of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the &#147;<U>TBOC</U>&#148;) of the State
of Texas, under which law the Company is organized, empowers a corporation organized in Texas to
indemnify persons who serve as directors and/or officers of the corporation, or persons who serve
at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the Company permit indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to contractually agree to
indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by law, so that such persons will serve or
continue to serve the Company and/or its subsidiaries free from undue concern that they will not be
adequately indemnified; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional
service for and on behalf of the Company on the condition that the Indemnitee is indemnified
according to the terms of this Agreement;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the Indemnitee&#146;s agreement to provide

Counsel, the Company shall furnish notice to the Indemnitee within ten days after
receipt of a claim of or request for indemnification, specifying the identity and
address of the Special Legal Counsel and a certification by the Special Legal
Counsel that the Special Legal Counsel has reviewed and is in compliance with the
requirements to be a Special Legal Counsel. The Indemnitee may, within seven days
after receipt of such written notice of selection, deliver to the Company a written
objection to such selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that
the Special Legal Counsel selected does not meet the requirements of a Special Legal
Counsel as defined in this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with
particularity the factual basis for that assertion. If there is an objection to the
selection of the Special Legal Counsel, either the Company or the Indemnitee may
petition the Court for a determination that the objection is without a reasonable
basis and/or for the appointment of a Special Legal Counsel selected by the Court.
The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of the Special Legal
Counsel incurred in connection with any such determination. If a Change in Control
shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall be presumed (except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement) to be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
upon submission of a request to the Company for indemnification, and thereafter the
Company shall have the burden of proof in overcoming that presumption in reaching a
determination contrary to that presumption. The presumption shall be used by the
Special Legal Counsel, or such other person or persons determining entitlement to
indemnification, as a basis for a determination of entitlement to indemnification
unless the Company provides information sufficient to overcome such presumption by
clear and convincing evidence or the investigation, review and analysis of the
Special Legal Counsel or such other person or persons convinces him or them by clear
and convincing evidence that the presumption should not apply.

Company of the Indemnitee&#146;s written claim for indemnification; provided, however,
that in the case of a determination to be made by Special Legal Counsel the
selection of whom is the subject of an existing objection, such determination, and
the Indemnitee&#146;s notification of such determination, shall be made not later than 20
days after the selection of the Special Legal Counsel is finally determined.

determine entitlement to indemnification have not made a determination within the
applicable period set forth in this Section&nbsp;6(d), the Indemnitee shall be deemed to
be entitled to indemnification unless the Company establishes that a Disqualifying
Event has occurred. Subject to applicable law, determinations of entitlement to
indemnification made, or deemed to have been made, in accordance with the provisions
of this Section&nbsp;6, shall be conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto
unless, in the event the Company has previously determined to indemnify the
Indemnitee, the Company establishes as provided in the final sentence of this
Section&nbsp;6 that: (i)&nbsp;the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material
fact in making the request for indemnification; or (ii)&nbsp;such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable law (each event described in subclause (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;of this

provided, however, that in any such action the Company will have the burden of
proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event.

equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself
adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that (a)
the Indemnitee did not conduct himself in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed,
in the case of conduct in his official capacity, to be in the best interests of the Company, or, in
all other cases, that at least his conduct was not opposed to the Company&#146;s best interests, or (b)
with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was unlawful.

or pursuant to, this Agreement either, at the Indemnitee&#146;s option, in (a)&nbsp;an appropriate court of
the State of Texas or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or (b)&nbsp;an arbitration to be
conducted by a single arbitrator, selected by mutual agreement of the Company and the Indemnitee
(or, failing such agreement by the then sitting Chief Judge of the United States District Court for
the appropriate jurisdiction), pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration Association. In the event that the Indemnitee seeks any such judicial adjudication or
arbitration award to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of rights created
under or pursuant to, this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company,
and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him in such judicial adjudication but only if he prevails therein. If it shall be
determined in said judicial adjudication that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not
all of the indemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the Expenses incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication shall be reasonably prorated in good faith
by counsel for the Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control shall have
occurred, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification

Indemnitee against Expenses pursuant to Section&nbsp;2, in the event there is a Proceeding by reason of
(or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event against several persons, including the
Indemnitee, who have a right of indemnification against the Company with respect to Expenses
relating to such Proceeding and who have totally common interests such that their goals are
identical and there are no conflicts-of-interest among them, then such group of persons shall, by
majority vote of such persons, select a single attorney or law firm to serve as the sole and
exclusive legal counsel for all of the members of such group (including the Indemnitee). In the
event the Indemnitee acts independently by retaining the legal services of any other attorney or
law firm to additionally or separately represent him, all Expenses relating to such independently
retained attorney or law firm shall be the sole responsibility of the Indemnitee.

any other rights to which the Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the
articles of incorporation of the Company, the Bylaws of the Company, agreement, insurance,
arrangement, a vote of shareholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. To the extent that
a change in the TBOC or other applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits
greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company&#146;s articles
of incorporation or bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.

determination whether or not it is practicable for the Company to obtain and maintain a policy or
policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies providing the directors and officers of
the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, with coverage for losses incurred in connection with
their services to the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates or to ensure the Company&#146;s
performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Among other considerations,
the Company will weigh the costs of obtaining such insurance coverage against the protection
afforded by such coverage. To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies
providing directors&#146; and/or officers&#146; liability insurance, the Indemnitee shall be covered by such
policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage
available for any of the Company&#146;s directors and/or officers. The Company shall not be liable
under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the
extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any bylaws, insurance
policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.
