CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Company restricted stock, but excluding any Company Common Stock to be canceled without payment of any consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(d)_), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted automatically into the right to receive, a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock in the ratio provided in _Section 4.1(b)_ below (the "Exchange Ratio") (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.2(e)_ , the "Merger Consideration"), upon surrender, in the manner provided in  _Section 4.2_, of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common 

   #####

represented by book entry (a "Book Entry Share"). 

   

 (b) _Determination of Exchange Ratio_. If the Average Price of Parent Common Stock is, as of the date that is two business days prior to the earliest of the Parent Shareholders Meeting or Company Shareholders Meeting contemplated by _Section 7.4_ hereof (the "Price Determination Date"), equal to or greater than $32.54 but less than or equal to $52.54, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.188; _provided, however,_ that if the Average Price of Parent Common Stock is, as of the Price Determination Date, less than $32.54 or greater than $52.54 (in either case, an "Ultimate Price Event"), then Parent and the Company shall seek, in good faith, to negotiate an Exchange Ratio that is acceptable to both parties, and if such parties fail to reach agreement within two business days of the Price Determination Date, either Parent or Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.2(e)_. 

   

 For purposes of this _Section 4.1(b)_, "Average Price" means the average of the volume weighted average of the trading price of Parent Common Stock, as such price is reported on NASDAQ as reported in the National Edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, such other source as the parties shall agree in writing, for the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the Price Determination Date. 

   

 (c) _Cancellation of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, each such share of Company Common Stock (other than Company Common Stock to be canceled without payment of any consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(d)_) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such share of Company Common Stock and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)_. 

   

 (d) _Cancellation of Remaining Shares of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and held in the CompanyÂ’s treasury and each share of Company Common Stock owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent or Merger Sub, shall, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist without payment of any consideration therefor, and no shares of Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (e) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Entity. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. 

   

 (i) All options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and other awards (collectively, "Company Equity Awards") made under the CompanyÂ’s stock plans (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") prior to the Effective Time, which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, are identified in _Section 4.1(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (ii) In the event a Company Equity Award constitutes a grant of restricted stock and to the extent such award is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Company Restricted Stock Award"), such Company Restricted Stock Award shall be deemed to be fully vested as of the Effective Time, and the holder of such Company Restricted Stock Award shall receive the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock Plan, including any terms and conditions regarding any Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld, if any, with respect to the vesting of such Company Restricted Stock Award. 

   

 (iii) In the event a Company Equity Award constitutes a stock option grant and to the extent such award is outstanding during the 30-day period that ends immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Company Stock Option Award"), (A) such Company Stock Option Award shall be deemed to be fully vested and exercisable during such period, and (B) to the extent such Company Stock Option Award is exercised during such period, the holder of such Company Stock Option Award shall receive the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option Award (to the extent exercised) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock Plan, including any terms and conditions regarding the payment of the exercise price and any Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld, if any, with respect to the exercise of such Company Stock Option Award. To the extent any Company Stock Option Awards remain outstanding and unexercised as of the close of the 30-day period that ends immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Stock Option Awards (A) shall be deemed to be fully vested and exercisable and (B) shall be continued and assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time pursuant to their terms (such awards are referred to herein as the "Rollover Awards"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent Common Stock shall replace the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such awards pursuant to this Agreement and the exercise price, if any, for such awards, if any, shall be adjusted as provided pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (iv) The assumption of Rollover Awards shall be made pursuant to this  _Section 4.1(f)_, so that at the Effective Time, the applicable Company Stock Plans shall be assumed by Parent (with such adjustments thereto as may be required to reflect the Merger, including the substitution of Parent Common Stock for Company Common Stock thereunder) and the Rollover Awards shall be assumed and adjusted by Parent, subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plans and the applicable award agreements entered into 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that for periods beginning
immediately following the Effective Time, (A) each Rollover Award shall be
exercisable only for that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Rollover Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (B) the
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be an amount equal to
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Rollover
Award in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
the Exchange Ratio (the price per share, as so determined, being rounded up
to the nearest whole cent); _provided_ , that in no event shall the exercise
price per share be less than the par value of Parent Common Stock. For the
avoidance of doubt, any exercise of a Rollover Award shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, including any terms and conditions regarding the payment of the
exercise price and any Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld, if
any, with respect to the exercise of such Rollover Award. The adjustments
provided in this paragraph with respect to any Rollover Awards shall be and
are intended to be effective in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and, to the
extent applicable, Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. 

   

 (v) Except as otherwise provided herein or as set forth in _Section 4.1(f)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, from and after the period that begins as of the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall take no action to provide for the extension of the term or exercise period with respect to any Company Equity Award (unless such extension is required under such Company Equity Awards or any applicable employment or change in control agreement pursuant any terms thereunder that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement). To the extent such extension is required under the terms of such Company Equity Awards (or any applicable employment or change in control agreement) or as set forth in _Section 4.1(f)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions (if any) as may be required to cause such extension to occur at the Effective Time and immediately prior to any assumption of the Company Stock Plan by Parent (to the extent permitted under the terms of such Company Stock Plan as of the date of this Agreement). 

   

 (vi) Promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of the Company Equity Awards, and shall cause such registration statement to remain effective for as long as there are outstanding any such Company Equity Awards. Except as otherwise specifically provided by this _Section 4.1(f)_, the terms of the Company Equity Awards and the relevant Company Stock Plans, as in effect on the Effective Time, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the Company Equity Awards after giving effect to the Merger and the assumptions by Parent as set forth above. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Rollover Awards appropriate notices stating that such Rollover Awards and such agreements shall have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 4.1(f)_). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vii) Nothing in this _Section 4.1(f)_ is intended to release any employee or service provider to the Company from any provisions relating to any non-competition, non-solicitation, or confidentiality provisions (or similar provisions) of any Company Equity Award and any associated damages or forfeitures (the "Equity Award Restrictive Covenants"), which shall survive the Effective Time. The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure the survival of the Equity Award Restrictive Covenants and the succession of Parent to the benefits of the Equity Award Restrictive Covenants. 

  

 Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Company Common Stock_. 

    

 (a) _Exchange Fund_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book Entry Shares (the "Exchange Agent"). Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article IV, plus the additional cash amounts sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto in accordance with  _Section 4.2(c)_, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Parent shall deposit such shares of Parent Common Stock with the Exchange Agent by delivering to the Exchange Agent certificates representing, or providing to the Exchange Agent an uncertificated book-entry for, such shares. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of the corresponding Certificates to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agentÂ’s message" with respect to Book Entry Shares and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with  _Section 4.2(c)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested (in accordance with _Section 4.2(i)_) and which shall represent, in the aggregate, that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ and (y) a check representing cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, pursuant to _Section 4.2(e)_ and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV, after giving effect to any required withholding Tax, and any Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

   ##### 

  

    

will be paid or will accrue on the cash in lieu of fractional shares and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Company
Common Stock. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested (in accordance with _Section
4.2(i)_) and which shall represent, in the aggregate, the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV, may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock until the holder of such shares shall surrender such shares in accordance with this Article IV. Subject to Applicable Law, following surrender of any such shares, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 4.1_, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and with a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid, less the amount of any withholding Taxes, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives with a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to the date of such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender, less the amount of any withholding Taxes. 

   

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer Books_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued, and any cash paid, upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article IV shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by Certificates or Book Entry Shares. The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. At or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled to pursuant to  _Section 4.2(e)_) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. 

   

 (i) No certificates of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued pursuant hereto, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a shareholder of Parent. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (x) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock, multiplied by (y) the closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock as such price is reported on the NASDAQ and published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date. 

   

 (iii) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Entity to deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. 

   

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same) that remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the Company as of the date six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable to such former shareholder pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity, any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person for any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock, as provided in _Section 4.2(c)_, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) _Parent Book Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties intend that Parent may, at its sole option, be permitted to utilize a direct registration system in accordance with the NASDAQ rules and Applicable Law for the shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered under this Agreement, so that, if Parent so elects, all or any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in connection with this Agreement may be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested in writing by a holder of one or more Certificates. 

   

 (j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ , that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Article IV. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid promptly to Parent. 

   

 (k) _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

 Section 4.3 _Adjustment of Exchange Ratio_. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction or event, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and other items dependent thereon shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 (d) Parent has (i) established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and (ii) has disclosed to its auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A) any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in the Public Accounting Oversight BoardÂ’s Auditing Standard No. 5) in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which could adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal control over financial reporting.

were effective using the framework specified in ParentÂ’s annual report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. To the knowledge
of Parent, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

All Parent Permits are in full force and effect and there exists no default thereunder or breach thereof in any material respect.

   ##### 

  

    

facilitate, any inquiry or the making or announcement of any proposal or offer

Acquisition Proposal in respect of such No-Shop Party, (ii) engage, continue

to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality agreements contemplated by
this _Section 7.3_), or (iv) propose publicly or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this paragraph by any Representative of a No-
Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise, shall be a breach of this _Section 7.3(a)_ by such No-Shop
Party. 

   

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, as applicable, a No-Shop Party may, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, (i) furnish information and access, but only in response to a written request for information or access, to any person making an Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited, initiated, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by the No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives and (ii) may participate in discussions and negotiate with such Person concerning any such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent all of the following conditions are met: (A) the No-Shop Party has not breached this _Section 7.3(a)_ in any material respect with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (B) the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (C) the No-Shop Party enters into a customary confidentiality agreement with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal which is (1) no less favorable to the No-Shop Party and (2) no less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 28, 2010, as amended on June 1, 2010, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and all such information provided thereunder has previously been provided to the Other Party or is provided to the Other Party concurrently with its provision to such Person.

days upon request by the Other Party (publicly if so requested) the
Company Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as applicable (any
action or failure described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change" or a "Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change", as applicable). 

   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, as
applicable, and subject to the No-Shop PartyÂ’s compliance at all times with
the provisions of this _Section 7.3_, (i) the Board of Directors of the No-
Shop Party may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, or (ii) the No-Shop Party
may terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement, understanding or
arrangement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (a "Superior Acquisition
Proposal Termination"), in each case, if and only to the extent all of the
following conditions are met: (A) the Acquisition Proposal has not been
withdrawn, (B) the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the No-Shop Party under
Applicable Law, and (D) in the case of a Superior Acquisition Proposal
Termination, the concurrent payment of the applicable Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 9.5(a)_ or _Section 9.5(b)_, as applicable;
_provided_ , _however_ , no Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, or Superior Acquisition
Proposal Termination may be made or occur, in each case, 

   

(1) until after the third business day following the Other PartyÂ’s receipt
of written notice (a "Change/Intent to Terminate Notice") from the No-Shop
Party advising the Other Party that the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors
intends to take such action or the No-Shop Party intends to terminate this
Agreement, which Change/Intent to Terminate Notice will specify the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Change/Intent to Terminate Notice and a new
three business day period); 

   

(2) unless during such three business day period, the No-Shop Party
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, upon the Other
PartyÂ’s request, discuss with the Other Party in good faith this Agreement
and any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the
Other Party may propose in response to the Acquisition Proposal; and 

   

(3) if, prior to the expiration of such three business day period, the
Other Party makes a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be at least as favorable as
the Acquisition Proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal; 

   ##### 

  

    

provided, however, that the No-Shop Party need not comply with the provisions
of subclauses (2) and (3) of this _Section 7.3(b)_ if the No-Shop PartyÂ’s
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Superior
Proposal (as specified in the Change/Intent to Terminate Notice issued to the
Other Party pursuant to subclause (1) of this  _Section 7.3(b)_) constitutes
a Special Valuation Proposal. 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of each No-Shop Party set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section 7.3_, each No-Shop Party shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt thereof) advise the Other Party orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto). Each No-Shop Party shall (i) keep the Other Party reasonably informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to the Other Party as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that such No-Shop Party need not inform the Other Party regarding the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit any No-Shop Party or any Board of Directors of a No-Shop Party from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other Applicable Law, if, in the good faith judgment of the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors, after receipt of advice from outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the No-Shop Party under Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the No-Shop Party or its Board of Directors take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by  _Section 7.3(b_). 

   

 (e) Each No-Shop Party (i) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated and shall cause its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal in respect of such No-Shop Party and (ii) shall promptly request the return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives. 

   

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means, with respect to either No-Shop Party, any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not in writing, from any Person other than the Other Party or its Affiliates relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute 20% or 

   ##### 

  

    

more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets (based on
either book or fair market value) of such No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries,
or (ii) 20% or more of any class of equity securities of such No-Shop Party,
(B) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of
such No-Shop Party, or (C) merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or
similar transaction involving such No-Shop Party, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) "Special Valuation Proposal" means a Superior Proposal that the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that, if consummated, would result in such No-Shop PartyÂ’s shareholders receiving consideration valued at 115% or more of the consideration to be received by such No-Shop PartyÂ’s shareholders pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as such consideration may have then been modified by the Other Party in response to such Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (iii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by any Person other than the Other Party or its Affiliates, which, if consummated, would result in such Person (or its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or at least 80% of all the assets of the No-Shop Party, which the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside counsel, to be (A) more favorable to the shareholders of the No-Shop Party from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal, the Person making such proposal and this Agreement (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation, strategic considerations, legal and regulatory considerations, and any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Other Party in response to such offer or otherwise pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ ) and (B) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. For purposes of the definitions of "Acquisition Proposal," "Special Valuation Proposal" and "Superior Proposal," the term "Person" shall include any group within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.

   ##### 

  

    

not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed promptly with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company. 

   

 (e) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company Bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company Board shall, subject to _Section 7.3(b)_, make the Company Recommendation, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with _Section 7.3_ or (ii) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IX and subject to compliance with _Section 7.3_, the Company will submit this Agreement for approval by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 (f) Each party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this  _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that the fee contemplated by this  _Section 9.5_ is not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in amounts reasonably estimated by the parties to compensate the other party for efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay the amount due pursuant to this  _Section 9.5_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment for a fee payable pursuant to this _Section 9.5_, such party shall also reimburse the other partyÂ’s costs and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_. Any payment to be made under this _Section 9.5_ shall be made by wire transfer of same-day funds. 

   

 (g) Each party agrees that in the event that a termination fee is paid pursuant to  _Section 9.5(a)_ or _Section 9.5(b)_, the payment of such termination fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the party to which such fee is paid, its Subsidiaries and any of its respective shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or Representatives (collectively, "Related Persons"), and in no event will the party to which such fee is paid or 

   ##### 

  

    

any of its Related Persons be entitled to recover any other money damages or
any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to, (i) any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
(ii) the termination of this Agreement, (iii) any liabilities or obligations
arising under this Agreement, or (iv) any Proceedings arising out of or
relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this
Agreement, and upon payment to the Company or Parent, as applicable, such
other party shall not have any further liability or obligation to the party
that paid such termination fee or any of its Related Persons relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (h) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to _Section 9.1_ through _Section 9.4_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and all obligations of the parties hereto and their Related Persons shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 9.5, the last sentence of _Section 7.6_, _Section 7.10_ and Article X; _provided_ , that, except as provided in _Section 9.5(g)_, nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability arising out of actual fraud or for any willful and material breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, and all rights and remedies of the nonbreaching party under this Agreement, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and the provisions of such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material delivered by any party hereunder. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party may by action taken by its Board of Directors (or by any duly authorized committee thereof), to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive in whole or in part any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive in whole or in part compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, or delay or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any party as a result of any breach or default hereunder by any other party, shall be deemed to impair any such right, power or remedy, nor will it be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

In the event the provisions of indemnification set forth below are more restrictive than the provisions of indemnification allowed by Chapter 8 of the Code, then such persons named above shall be indemnified to the full extent permitted by Chapter 8 of the Code as it may exist from time to time. 

   

 (2) In case of a suit by or in the right of the Corporation against a person named in paragraph (1) of this ARTICLE VII by reason of such personÂ’s holding a position named in such paragraph (1) hereafter referred to as a derivative suit, the corporation shall indemnify such person for reasonable expenses actually incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of the suit, but only if such person satisfies the standard in paragraph (4) of this ARTICLE VII. 

   

 (3) In case of a threatened or pending suit, action, or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative), other than a derivative suit, hereafter referred to as a non-derivative suit, against a person named in paragraph (1) of this ARTICLE VII by reason of such personÂ’s holding a position named in such paragraph (1), the Corporation shall indemnify such person if such person satisfies the standard contained in paragraph (4) of this ARTICLE VII, for amounts actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of the non-derivative suit as expenses (including court costs and attorneysÂ’ fees), amounts paid in settlement, judgments, and fines. 

   

 (4) Whether in the nature of a derivative suit or non-derivative suit, a person named in paragraph (1) of this ARTICLE VII will be indemnified only if it is determined in accordance with paragraph (5) of this ARTICLE VII that such person:

   ##### 

  

 

The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent will not, of itself, create
a presumption that this person failed to satisfy the standard contained in
this paragraph. 

    

 (5) A determination that the standard of paragraph (4) of this ARTICLE VII has been satisfied must be made: 

   

 (a) by a majority vote of the of directors of the Corporation who at the time of the vote are disinterested and independent, regardless of whether the directors who are disinterested and independent constitute a quorum; or 

   

 (b) by a majority vote of a committee of the Board of Directors, if the committee (i) is designated to act in the matter by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation who at the time of the vote are disinterested and independent, regardless of whether the directors who are disinterested and independent constitute a quorum and (ii) consists solely of two or more directors who are disinterested and independent; or 

   

 (c) by special legal counsel selected by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors by vote as set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above; or 

   

 (d) by the shareholders in a vote that excludes the vote of directors who are not disinterested and independent. 

   

 (6) Authorization of indemnification and determination as to reasonableness of expenses must be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination that indemnification is permissible is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification and determination as to reasonableness of expenses must be made in the manner specified by subparagraph (5)(c) of this ARTICLE VII for the selection of special legal counsel. 

   

 (7) The corporation may reimburse or pay in advance any reasonable expenses (including court costs and attorneysÂ’ fees) which may become subject to indemnification under paragraphs (1) through (6) above, but only in accordance with the provisions as stated in paragraph (5) of this ARTICLE VII, and only after the person to receive the payment (a) signs a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under paragraph (4) of this ARTICLE VII, and (b) undertakes in writing to repay such advances unless it is ultimately determined that such person is entitled to indemnification by the Corporation. The written undertaking required by this paragraph must be an unlimited general obligation of the person to receive the payment but need not be secured. It may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment. 

   

 (8) The indemnification provided by paragraphs (1) through (6) of this ARTICLE VII will not be exclusive of any other rights to which a person may be entitled by law, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 

   #####

 (iii) by special legal counsel selected by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors by vote as set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above; or 

  

 (iv) by the shareholders in a vote that excludes the vote of directors who are not disinterested and independent.

as to reasonableness of expenses, must be made in the manner specified by
paragraph (e)(3) of this Article VI for the selection of special legal
counsel. 

   

 (g) The Corporation may reimburse or pay in advance any reasonable expenses (including court costs and attorneysÂ’ fees) which may become subject to indemnification under subsections (a) through (f) of this Article VI, but only in accordance with the provisions as stated in subsection (e) of this Article VI, and only after the person to receive the payment: (i) signs a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under subsection (d); and (ii) undertakes in writing to repay such advances unless it is ultimately determined that such person is entitled to indemnification by the Corporation. The written undertaking required by this subsection (g) must be an unlimited general obligation of the person to receive the payment but need not be secured. It may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment. 

  

 (h) The indemnification provided by subsections (a) through (f) of this Article VI will not be exclusive of any other rights to which a person may be entitled by law, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 

  

 (i) The indemnification and advance payment provided by subsections (a) through (g) of this Article VI will continue as to a person who has ceased to hold a position named in subsection (a) of this Article VI and will inure to such personÂ’s heirs, executors, and administrators. 

  

 (j) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who holds or has held any position named in subsection (a) of this Article VI against any liability incurred by such person in any such position, or arising out of such personÂ’s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify such person against such liability under subsections (a) through (g) of this Article VI.

   #####

of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

proceeding brought in such a court or any claim that any such
proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum,

such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10(a)or any other
manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service

shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the

CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT.

applicable, in such claim or action. The Company agrees to pay or reimburse
Employee for all of EmployeeÂ’s reasonable travel and other direct expenses
incurred, or to be reasonably incurred, to comply with EmployeeÂ’s obligations

otherwise, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect any method or

value or, if leased, by assuming the lease. Furthermore, (A) if the Company

---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | _Provision of Confidential Information;
Acknowledgements_. During the Term of this Agreement, in order to assist the
Executive with the ExecutiveÂ’s duties, the Company agrees to provide the
Executive with Confidential Information. The Executive acknowledges and
agrees that all Confidential Information is confidential and a valuable,
special and unique asset of the Company that gives the Company an
advantage over its actual and potential, current and future competitors. The
Executive acknowledges and agrees that, as between the Executive and the
Company, the Confidential Information is now, and will at all times remain,
the exclusive property of the Company, and the Executive has no ownership
interest in any Confidential Information. The Executive acknowledges and
agrees that, as part of the ExecutiveÂ’s duties under this Agreement, the
Executive owes the Company a fiduciary duty to preserve and protect all
Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure or use. The Executive  
---|---|---|--- 
     

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | recognizes that disclosure of the Confidential
Information to competitors, non-authorized third parties or the general
public, or use of the Confidential Information by the Executive for the
ExecutiveÂ’s own benefit _,_ would be detrimental and cause irreparable harm
to the Company.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | _Non-Disclosure of the Confidential Information_.
The Executive covenants and agrees that during the Term and following the
termination (for any reason) of this Agreement, the Executive will keep
secret and treat confidentially the Confidential Information, and will not
disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity for any purpose
other than as directed by the Company in connection with the business and
affairs of the Company nor shall the Executive use any Confidential
Information for any purpose other than as directed by the Company
in connection with the business and affairs of the Company. Except in the
proper performance of his duties, the Executive will not copy, reproduce,
decompile, or reverse engineer, any Confidential Information, or remove or
transmit by email or other electronic means Confidential Information from the
premises of the Company absent specific consent. The Executive agrees that
all restrictions contained in this clause are reasonable and valid in the
circumstances. This contractual confidentiality obligation shall be in
addition to, and in no way a limitation of, all such confidentiality
obligations as may exist at law or in equity.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     9.  |   | __Restrictive Covenants__   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | _Consideration; Voluntary Agreement_. The Company
shall provide the Executive access to the Confidential Information for use
only during the Term, and the Executive acknowledges and agrees that the
Company will be entrusting the Executive, in the ExecutiveÂ’s unique and
special capacity, with developing the goodwill of the Company, and in
consideration thereof and in consideration of the access to Confidential
Information, has voluntarily agreed to the covenants set forth in
this Section 9\. The Executive further agrees and acknowledges that the
limitations and restrictions set forth herein, including but not limited to
geographical and temporal restrictions on certain competitive activities, are
reasonable and not oppressive and are material and substantial parts of this
Agreement intended and necessary to prevent unfair competition and to protect
the Confidential Information and substantial and legitimate business
interests and goodwill.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Non-Competition_. During the Term and during the
applicable Non-Competition Period, the Executive agrees that the Executive
will not, directly or indirectly, acting alone or in conjunction with others,
or as an employee, consultant or independent contractor, or as partner,
officer, director, shareholder, manager, member or owner of any interest in
or security of, any partnership, corporation, limited liability company or
other business entity, venture or enterprise, engage or participate, for
compensation or without compensation, in any business which is in competition
with the Company or its Affiliates as conducted at the time of termination of
the ExecutiveÂ’s employment by the Company, in the geographic locations where
the Company or its Affiliates does business; provided, however, the Executive
may have investments in publicly-owned companies which investments do not
constitute more than 5% of the voting securities of any such company.  
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (c)  |   | _Non-Solicitation of Customers_. During the Term
and during the applicable Non-Competition Period, the Executive agrees that
the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, solicit any customer of the
Company or its Affiliates with whom the Executive conducted business during
the Term either to purchase products or services that are competitive to the
products and services then sold by the Company (customer defined as any
person or entity for which the Company has performed services or sold goods
during the Term) or to reduce or cease business with the Company or
its Affiliates.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. During the Term and
during the applicable Non-Competition Period, the Executive agrees that the
Executive will not, directly or indirectly, hire or induce or solicit any
current employee of the Company or any Affiliate or any person who was an
employee of the Company or any Affiliate during the final 12 months of the
ExecutiveÂ’s employment to terminate the employeeÂ’s employment with the
Company or to work for the Executive or the ExecutiveÂ’s employer.  
      
    | (e)  |   | _Non-Disparagement_ _._ During the Term and for five
years after termination (for any reason) of the ExecutiveÂ’s employment, the
Executive agrees to refrain from criticizing, denigrating or speaking
adversely of the Company and its Affiliates and their respective operations
and their respective executives, and disclosing negative information about
the Company or its Affiliates and their respective operations and respective
executives, management, directors, except as required by law. During such
same five-year period, the Company agrees to instruct its senior management
and the senior management of its Affiliates to refrain from criticizing,
denigrating or speaking adversely of the Executive, and disclosing negative
information about the Executive, except as required by law.  
      
    | (f)  |   | _Reasonableness of Scope_. The Executive represents and
agrees that the geographic scope of the restrictive covenants are necessary
and reasonable in light of the scope of the CompanyÂ’s and its AffiliatesÂ’
business. The Executive further represents and agrees that the time periods
of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable given
the value of the good will, customer relationships, Confidential Information
and other tangible and intangible assets. If one or more of the provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to
scope, activity or subject matter so as to be unenforceable at law,
such provision(s) shall be construed and reformed by the appropriate judicial
body by limiting and reducing it (or them), so as to be enforceable to the
maximum extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.  
   

  

     10.  |   | __Discoveries and Inventions__   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | _Assignment of Work Product to the Company_. The
Executive assigns and agrees to assign to the Company, without additional
compensation, all the ExecutiveÂ’s right, title, and interest in and to any
and all Work Product and any related or associated intellectual property. For
clarity, Work Product does not have to be subject to or eligible for federal
or state patent, copyright or trademark protection to be subject to this
provision. If any such Work Product is created wholly or in part by the
Executive during the ExecutiveÂ’s hours of actual work for the Company, or
with the aid of the CompanyÂ’s materials, equipment, or  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | personnel, or at the premises of the Company, or
resulted from or in any way were derived or generated by performance of the
Executives duties under this Agreement, or is in any way related to or
derived from the services or products the Company or its Affiliates produces
or offers, then such creation shall be deemed conclusively to have occurred
in the course of the ExecutiveÂ’s employment. It is recognized that the
Executive will perform the duties assigned to the Executive at times other
than the ExecutiveÂ’s actual working hours and the CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder
shall not be diminished because the Work Product was created at such other
time.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | _Cooperation; Grant of License_. The Executive
agrees to perform all acts necessary or reasonably requested by the Company
to enable the Company to learn of, understand, protect, obtain and enforce
patent or copyright rights to the Work Product, including but not limited to,
making full and immediate disclosure and description to the Company of the
Work Product, and assisting in preparation and execution of documents
required to transfer and convey the Work Product and to convey to the Company
patent, copyright or any other intellectual property protection in the United
States and any foreign jurisdiction. In the event the Company is unable
to secure the signature of the Executive to any document required to file,
prosecute, register or memorialize the assignment of any patent copyright
maskwork, the Executive irrevocably appoints the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company as the ExecutiveÂ’s agent and attorney in fact to act for and on
behalf of and instead of the Executive to take such actions needed to enforce
and obtain the CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder. To the extent any of the
ExecutiveÂ’s rights, title or interest to the Work Product can not be assigned
to the Company, the Executive grants and will grant an exclusive, world
wide, transferable, irrevocable, royalty-license (with rights to sublicense
without consent of the Executive) to the Company to exploit fully such Work
Product. These obligations shall continue beyond the termination of this
Agreement and shall be binding upon the ExecutiveÂ’s assigns, executors,
administrators and other legal representatives.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     11.  |   | __Injunctive Relief__   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | The Executive acknowledges that the provisions of
Sections 8, 9 and 10 are necessary for the protection of the Company. The
Company and its affiliates would be irreparably damaged in the event any of
the restrictions contained in Sections 8, 9 or 10 were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were to be otherwise breached.
Therefore, the Company shall be entitled to temporary restraining orders and
temporary and permanent injunction or injunctions to specifically enforce the
restrictions in Sections 8, 9 or 10 in any court, without the necessity of
proving actual damages or posting a bond of any type or size, in addition to
any other remedy to which the Company may be entitled, at law or in equity,
all of which shall be cumulative and not exclusive. No failure or delay by
the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any whole or
partial exercise of any such right power or privilege preclude any other or
further exercise thereof.

     12.  |   | __Arbitration__   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Subject to Section 12(b), any dispute,
controversy or claim between the Executive and the Company arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the ExecutiveÂ’s employment with the Company
will be finally settled by arbitration in Midland, Texas before, and in
accordance with the rules for the resolution of employment disputes then in
effect of, the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). The arbitration
award shall be final and binding on both parties.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Any arbitration conducted under this Section 12 shall
be heard by a single arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ ") selected in accordance
with the then-applicable rules of the AAA. The Arbitrator shall expeditiously
(and, if possible, within 90 days after the selection of the Arbitrator) hear
and decide all matters concerning the dispute. Except as expressly provided
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Arbitrator shall have the power to (i)
gather such materials, information, testimony and evidence as he or she deems
relevant to the dispute before him or her (and each party will provide such
materials, information, testimony and evidence requested by the Arbitrator,
except to the extent any information so requested is subject to an attorney-
client or other privilege or other valid objection and, if the information
so requested is proprietary or subject to a third party confidentiality
restriction, the arbitrator shall enter an order providing that such material
will be subject to a confidentiality agreement), and (ii) grant injunctive
relief and enforce specific performance. The decision of the Arbitrator shall
be rendered in writing, be final, non-appealable and binding upon the
disputing parties and the parties agree that judgment upon the award may be
entered by any court of competent jurisdiction; _provided_  that the parties
agree that the Arbitrator and any court enforcing the award of the Arbitrator
shall not have the right or authority to award punitive or exemplary
damages to any disputing party.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Each side shall share equally the cost of the
arbitration and bear its own costs and attorneysÂ’ fees incurred in connection
with any arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that compelling
reasons exist for allocating all or a portion of such costs and fees to the
other side.  
      
    | (d)  |   | Notwithstanding Section 12(a), an application for
emergency or temporary injunctive relief by either party shall not be subject
to arbitration under this Section; provided, however, that the remainder of
any such dispute (beyond the application for emergency or temporary
injunctive relief) shall be subject to arbitration under this Section.  
      
    | (e)  |   | By entering into this Agreement and entering into the
arbitration provisions of this Section 12, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE
AND AGREE THAT THEY ARE KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVING
THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL.  
      
    | (f)  |   | Nothing in this Section 12 shall prohibit a party to
this Agreement from (i) instituting litigation to enforce any arbitration
award, or (ii) joining another party to this Agreement in a litigation
initiated by a person or entity which is not a party to this Agreement.

     13.  |   | __Miscellaneous__   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | _Notification of Restrictions to Third Parties_
_._ The Executive agrees that during any period in which Sections 9(b), (c)
or (d) of this Agreement are in effect, if any, the Company may notify any
person or entity employing or contracting with the Executive or evidencing
any intention of employing or contracting with the Executive of the existence
and provisions of this Agreement. After termination of the ExecutiveÂ’s
employment and during any period in which Sections 9(b), (c) or (d) of
this Agreement are in effect, if any, if the Executive enters into an
employment consulting, or independent contractor relationship with any third
party which is in any way competitive with the Company, the Executive agrees
to provide the Company with written notice of the ExecutiveÂ’s job
responsibilities within five business days of the ExecutiveÂ’s acceptance of
such employment or other relationship (the " _Employment Notice_ "). The
Employment Notice shall include (1) a description of the duties
and responsibilities of the proposed position, (2) identity of the
employer(s) or contracting entity, and (3) the territory in which the
Executive will be providing services. If the Executive fails to provide the
required Employment Notice, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Company is entitled to presume that the ExecutiveÂ’s employment or
relationship violates the terms of this Agreement, and the Company will be
authorized by this Agreement to seek immediate injunctive relief as outlined
in this Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Severability_. If any covenant or provision herein is
finally adjudicated to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, it shall
be reformed, or if reformation is not possible, deleted from the remaining
Agreement and shall not affect or impair the validity of any other covenant
or provision of this Agreement. The Executive hereby agrees that all
restrictions in this Agreement are reasonable and valid.  
      
    | (c)  |   | _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains all of the
terms, conditions and agreements of the Parties with respect to the
ExecutiveÂ’s employment by the Company and cancels and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings between the Parties relating to the CompanyÂ’s

 _EXHIBIT F_  

   

 _FORM OF INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT_  

   

 This Indemnification Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of ________ __, 2011, by and between Dawson Geophysical Company, a Texas corporation (the " _Company_ "), and ________________ (the " _Indemnitee_ "). 

   

 WHEREAS, qualified persons are reluctant to serve organizations as directors or officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection against risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of such organizations; 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto recognize that the legal risks and potential liabilities, and the threat thereof, associated with lawsuits filed against persons serving the Company and/or its subsidiaries, and the resultant substantial time, expense and anxiety spent and endured in defending lawsuits bears no reasonable relationship to the compensation received by such persons, and thus poses a significant deterrent and increased reluctance on the part of experienced and capable individuals to serve the Company and/or its subsidiaries; 

   

 WHEREAS, the uncertainties related to obtaining adequate insurance and indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons; 

   

 WHEREAS, Chapter 8 of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the " _TBOC_ ") of the State of Texas, under which law the Company is organized, empowers a corporation organized in Texas to indemnify persons who serve as directors and/or officers of the corporation, or persons who serve at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the Company permit indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; 

   

 WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to contractually agree to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by law, so that such persons will serve or continue to serve the Company and/or its subsidiaries free from undue concern that they will not be adequately indemnified; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for and on behalf of the Company on the condition that the Indemnitee is indemnified according to the terms of this Agreement; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the IndemniteeÂ’s agreement to provide services to the Company and/or its subsidiaries and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

       ##### 

  

     

 1\. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (a) " _Agreement_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the preamble. 

   

 (b) " _Board_ " means the Board of Directors of the Company. 

   

 (c) " _Change in Control_ " means a change in control of the Company occurring after the date hereof in any of the following circumstances: (i) there shall have occurred an event required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or in response to any similar item on any similar schedule or form) promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation or other entity owned directly or indirectly by the shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, shall have become the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the CompanyÂ’s then outstanding voting securities without prior approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board in office immediately prior to such person attaining such percentage interest; (iii) the Company is a party to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale of assets or other reorganization, or a proxy contest, as a consequence of which members of the Board in office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the Board thereafter; or (iv) during any fifteen-month period, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board (including for this purpose any new director whose election or nomination for election by the CompanyÂ’s shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of such period) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board. 

   

 (d) " _Company_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the preamble. 

   

 (e) " _Disqualifying Event_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 6(d). 

   

 (f) " _Exchange Act_ " means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

   

 (g) " _Expenses_ " means any judgment, penalty, settlement, fine, excise or similar tax and all reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the types customarily incurred in connection with 

   ##### 

  

   

prosecuting, defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating,
or being or preparing to be a witness or otherwise participating in a
Proceeding. 

   

 (h) " _Indemnifiable Event_ " means any event or occurrence related to the fact that the Indemnitee is or was serving as a member of the Board and/or an officer of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. 

   

 (i) " _Indemnitee_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the preamble. 

   

 (j) " _Special Legal Counsel_ " means a law firm, or member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the five years previous to his selection or appointment has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party; (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder; or (iii) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the CompanyÂ’s then outstanding voting securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Special Legal Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing in the State of Texas, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the IndemniteeÂ’s rights to indemnification under this Agreement. 

   

 (k) " _Proceeding_ " includes (i) any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing and any other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, investigative or other, (ii) any appeal of an action or proceeding described in (i), or (iii) any inquiry or investigation, whether conducted by or on behalf of the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or any other party, formal or informal, that the Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of an action or proceeding described in (i), except one initiated by the Indemnitee (other than as provided pursuant to Section 8). 

   

 (l) " _TBOC_ " shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the recitals. 

  

 2\. _Indemnification Arrangement_. In the event the Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Proceeding by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, to the fullest extent permitted by the TBOC or other applicable law as the same may exist or be hereinafter amended (by statute or judicial decision) (but in the case of any such amendment, with respect to matters occurring before such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), the Company shall, subject to 

      ##### 

  

    

and in accordance with the provisions of Section 6, indemnify and hold
harmless the Indemnitee against any and all Expenses of such Proceeding as
soon as practicable but in any event no later than (a) in the case of an
initial written request for indemnification in connection with a Proceeding,
five days after a determination has been made, or is deemed to have been made,
that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification and (b) in the case of a
written request for indemnification made pursuant to Section 5 in connection
with a Proceeding for which a determination has been made that the Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification in connection with such Proceeding, five days
after such written request. 

   

 3\. _Advancement or Reimbursement of Expenses_. The rights of the Indemnitee provided under Section 2 shall include, but not be limited to, the right to be indemnified and to have all Expenses advanced (including the payment of Expenses before final disposition of a Proceeding) in all Proceedings to the fullest extent permitted, or not prohibited, by the TBOC or other applicable law. In addition, to the extent the Indemnitee is, by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, a witness or otherwise participates in any Proceeding at a time when he is not named a defendant or respondent in the Proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. The Indemnitee shall be advanced Expenses, within five days after any request for such advancement, to the fullest extent permitted, or not prohibited, by Chapter 8 of the TBOC; provided that the Indemnitee has provided to the Company all affirmations, acknowledgments, representations and undertakings that may be required of the Indemnitee by Chapter 8 of the TBOC. 

   

 4\. _No Settlement without Consent_. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent. The Company shall not settle any action or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the IndemniteeÂ’s written consent. Neither the Company nor the Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay their consent to any proposed settlement. 

   

 5\. _Request for Indemnification_. To obtain indemnification as herein provided, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the Company a written claim or request. Such written claim or request shall contain sufficient information to reasonably inform the Company about the nature and extent of the indemnification or advance sought by the Indemnitee. The Secretary of the Company shall promptly advise the Board of such request. 

   

 6\. _Determination of Request_. 

    

 (a) Upon written request to the Company by the Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the IndemniteeÂ’s entitlement thereto shall be made in accordance with Section 8.103(a)(1) or (2) of the TBOC; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, such determination shall be made by a Special Legal Counsel selected by the Board, unless the Indemnitee shall request (at the time the Indemnitee submits the written request for indemnification) that such determination be made in accordance with Section 8.103(a)(1) or (2) of the TBOC. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) If entitlement to indemnification is to be determined by a Special Legal Counsel, the Company shall furnish notice to the Indemnitee within ten days after receipt of a claim of or request for indemnification, specifying the identity and address of the Special Legal Counsel and a certification by the Special Legal Counsel that the Special Legal Counsel has reviewed and is in compliance with the requirements to be a Special Legal Counsel. The Indemnitee may, within seven days after receipt of such written notice of selection, deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Special Legal Counsel selected does not meet the requirements of a Special Legal Counsel as defined in this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis for that assertion. If there is an objection to the selection of the Special Legal Counsel, either the Company or the Indemnitee may petition the Court for a determination that the objection is without a reasonable basis and/or for the appointment of a Special Legal Counsel selected by the Court. The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of the Special Legal Counsel incurred in connection with any such determination. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall be presumed (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) to be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement upon submission of a request to the Company for indemnification, and thereafter the Company shall have the burden of proof in overcoming that presumption in reaching a determination contrary to that presumption. The presumption shall be used by the Special Legal Counsel, or such other person or persons determining entitlement to indemnification, as a basis for a determination of entitlement to indemnification unless the Company provides information sufficient to overcome such presumption by clear and convincing evidence or the investigation, review and analysis of the Special Legal Counsel or such other person or persons convinces him or them by clear and convincing evidence that the presumption should not apply. 

   

 (c) The Indemnitee will cooperate with the person or persons making the determination under this Section 6 with respect to the IndemniteeÂ’s entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement, including providing to such person or persons, on reasonable advance request, any documentation or information that is: (i) not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure; (ii) reasonably available to Indemnitee; and (iii) reasonably necessary to that determination. 

   

 (d) Any determination of the IndemniteeÂ’s entitlement to indemnification to be made pursuant to this Section 6 shall be made, and the Indemnitee shall be notified of such determination, not later than 20 days after receipt by the Secretary of the Company of the IndemniteeÂ’s written claim for indemnification; provided, however, that in the case of a determination to be made by Special Legal Counsel the selection of whom is the subject of an existing objection, such determination, and the IndemniteeÂ’s notification of such determination, shall be made not later than 20 days after the selection of the Special Legal Counsel is finally determined. Notwithstanding anything herein to 

   ##### 

  

   

the contrary, if the person or persons empowered under this Section 6
to determine entitlement to indemnification have not made a determination
within the applicable period set forth in this Section 6(d), the Indemnitee
shall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification unless the Company
establishes that a Disqualifying Event has occurred. Subject to applicable
law, determinations of entitlement to indemnification made, or deemed to have
been made, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6, shall be
conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto unless, in the event the
Company has previously determined to indemnify the Indemnitee, the Company
establishes as provided in the final sentence of this Section 6 that: (i) the
Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the
request for indemnification; or (ii) such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable law (each event described in subclause (i) or (ii) of this Section
6, a " _Disqualifying Event_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Texas or
any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the
Indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of a
Disqualifying Event; provided, however, that in any such action the Company
will have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event. 

  

 7\. _Effect of Certain Proceedings_. The termination of any Proceeding or of any matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that (a) the Indemnitee did not conduct himself in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed, in the case of conduct in his official capacity, to be in the best interests of the Company, or, in all other cases, that at least his conduct was not opposed to the CompanyÂ’s best interests, or (b) with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

   

 8\. _Expenses of Enforcement of Agreement_. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of rights created under or pursuant to, this Agreement either, at the IndemniteeÂ’s option, in (a) an appropriate court of the State of Texas or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or (b) an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator, selected by mutual agreement of the Company and the Indemnitee (or, failing such agreement by the then sitting Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the appropriate jurisdiction), pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. In the event that the Indemnitee seeks any such judicial adjudication or arbitration award to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of rights created under or pursuant to, this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in such judicial adjudication but only if he prevails therein. If it shall be determined in said judicial adjudication that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication shall be reasonably prorated in good faith by counsel for the Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification 

      ##### 

  

    

under this Section 8 regardless of whether the Indemnitee ultimately prevails
in such judicial adjudication. 

   

 9\. _Common Attorney_. Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company to indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses pursuant to Section 2, in the event there is a Proceeding by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event against several persons, including the Indemnitee, who have a right of indemnification against the Company with respect to Expenses relating to such Proceeding and who have totally common interests such that their goals are identical and there are no conflicts-of-interest among them, then such group of persons shall, by majority vote of such persons, select a single attorney or law firm to serve as the sole and exclusive legal counsel for all of the members of such group (including the Indemnitee). In the event the Indemnitee acts independently by retaining the legal services of any other attorney or law firm to additionally or separately represent him, all Expenses relating to such independently retained attorney or law firm shall be the sole responsibility of the Indemnitee. 

   

 10\. _Nonexclusive Rights; Subsequent Change in Law_. The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the articles of incorporation of the Company, the Bylaws of the Company, agreement, insurance, arrangement, a vote of shareholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. To the extent that a change in the TBOC or other applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the CompanyÂ’s articles of incorporation or bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. 

   

 11\. _D andO Liability Insurance_. The Company shall from time to time make a good faith determination whether or not it is practicable for the Company to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies providing the directors and officers of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, with coverage for losses incurred in connection with their services to the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates or to ensure the CompanyÂ’s performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Among other considerations, the Company will weigh the costs of obtaining such insurance coverage against the protection afforded by such coverage. To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directorsÂ’ and/or officersÂ’ liability insurance, the Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any of the CompanyÂ’s directors and/or officers. The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any bylaws, insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. 

   

 12\. _No Employment Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create in the Indemnitee any right to continued service as a director and/or officer with the Company. 

   

 13\. _Amendments; Waiver_. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto. No 

      ##### 

  

    

waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar)
nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. 

   

 14\. _Subrogation_. In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 

   

 15\. _Term_. This Agreement shall be effective from and after the date hereof, and shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) the sixth anniversary after the Indemnitee has ceased to be a member of the Board and/or an officer of the Company or otherwise hold a position that could give rise to an Indemnifiable Event or (b) the final termination or resolution of all Proceedings with respect to which the Company is indemnifying the Indemnitee against any and all Expenses relating to such Proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that are commenced prior to such six-year anniversary. 

   

 16\. _Notification and Defense of Claims_. The Indemnitee agrees to notify the Company promptly in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information, or other document relating to any matter which may be subject to indemnification hereunder, whether civil, criminal, or investigative; provided. however, that the failure of the Indemnitee to give such notice to the Company shall not adversely affect the IndemniteeÂ’s rights under this Agreement except to the extent the Company has been materially prejudiced as a direct result of such failure. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of the CompanyÂ’s right to seek participation at its own expense in any Proceeding which may give rise to indemnification hereunder. 

   

 17\. _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors or assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company), spouses, heirs, executors and personal or legal representatives. This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether the Indemnitee continues to serve as a director and/or officer of the Company. 

   

 18\. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable in any respect, and the validity and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. To the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 

   

 19\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and 

      ##### 

  

    

interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving
