shall survive the Closing for the Survival Period (as defined below) but, except as provided in
Section&nbsp;6.2(c) of this Agreement, shall not survive any termination of this Agreement. The
representations and warranties shall survive the Closing for the relevant period (the &#147;<B>Survival
Period</B>&#148;) determined as follows: (a)&nbsp;the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in
Section&nbsp;2.1, Section&nbsp;2.2, Section&nbsp;2.3 and Section&nbsp;2.4 of this Agreement and of the Buyer contained
in Section&nbsp;3.1, Section&nbsp;3.2, Section&nbsp;3.3 and Section&nbsp;3.4 of this Agreement shall survive the
Closing indefinitely; (b)&nbsp;the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section
2.12, Section&nbsp;2.13, Section&nbsp;2.14 and Section&nbsp;2.17 shall survive until the expiration of 90&nbsp;days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or prescription period (after
giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof); and (c)&nbsp;all other representations
and warranties of the Sellers contained in Article&nbsp;II of this Agreement and of the Buyer contained
in Article&nbsp;III of this Agreement shall survive until the expiration of a period of 18&nbsp;months
following the Closing Date. The parties agree that no claims or causes of action may be brought
against the Sellers or the Buyer based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the representations or
warranties contained in Articles II and III of this Agreement after the applicable Survival Period
or, except as provided in Section&nbsp;6.2(c) of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement;
<I>provided </I>that nothing herein shall preclude Sellers or Buyer from bringing or pursuing claims after
the end of the applicable Survival Period if notice thereof is given to the other party before the
end of such Survival Period. This Section&nbsp;7.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the
parties, including the covenants and agreements set forth in Section&nbsp;4.7 and Section&nbsp;4.9 of this
Agreement. Except as expressly provided in Section&nbsp;4.10, any claim by an indemnified party for
indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any investigation by or opportunity to
investigate afforded to such party, nor shall such a claim be adversely affected by such party&#146;s
knowledge on or before the Closing of any breach of the type specified in Section&nbsp;7.2(a)(i) or (ii)
or Section&nbsp;7.3(a)(i) or (ii)&nbsp;unless it shall be determined by a final judgment of a Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction over such Proceeding that the party seeking indemnification had actual
and express knowledge of such breach on or before the Closing.
