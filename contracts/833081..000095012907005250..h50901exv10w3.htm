 Section 1.9 _Intercompany Accounts and Agreements_.

Subject to Section 1.10 of this Agreement, no adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price as a result of any such cancellation. 

   

 Section 1.10 _Distribution; Purchase Price Adjustments_  

   

 (a) The parties agree that, so long as any distributions made are reflected in the Closing Date Schedule and in any adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 1.10(c), the Sellers shall have the right, at or prior to the Closing, to cause any Company and its Subsidiaries to distribute cash, accounts receivable and any other working capital items (except inventory) to the Sellers or their affiliates, by one or more dividends, repurchases of existing stock and/or other distributions; provided, however, that no Company or Subsidiary incorporated in Argentina will pay a dividend or otherwise make any distribution to its shareholders. 

   

 (b) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing, PII shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Buyer a schedule of components of combined Net Working Capital of the Companies and the Subsidiaries thereof listed in the notes to the Financial Statements (as defined below) as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Schedule") and a statement (the "Closing Statement") reflecting the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 1.10(c), accompanied by a certificate of an officer of PII to the effect that such statement has been prepared in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, (i) "Net Working Capital" means the amount of combined Current Assets of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries _minus_ the amount of combined Current Liabilities of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) "Current Assets" means the sum of cash and cash equivalents, net trade receivables, net parts and supplies and prepaid and other current assets (excluding deferred mobilization costs on _Rig 321_ ); and (iii) "Current Liabilities" means the sum of accounts payable, accounts payableaffiliates, note payableaffiliates and accrued expenses and other current liabilities (excluding deferred mobilization revenues on _Rig 321_ ); in each case as of the Closing Date and determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and consistent with the financial reporting policies and procedures used by the Sellers to prepare the combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 included in the Financial Statements; _provided, however,_ that Current Assets and Current Liabilities shall not include Taxes payable, Taxes receivable or deferred Taxes, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 1.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth the calculation of Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2006. The Buyer shall have a period of 45 calendar days after delivery of the Closing Date Schedule and the Closing Statement to review (and cause Buyers auditors to review) such documents and make any objections it may have in writing to PII. During such 45-day period, Buyer and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review the working papers of PIIs 

       ##### 

  

    

independent auditors relating to the Closing Date Schedule. If written
objections are delivered to PII by the Buyer within such 45-day period, then
the Buyer and PII shall attempt to resolve the matter or matters in
dispute. If no written objections are made by Buyer within such 45-day
period, then such Closing Date Schedule and Closing Statement shall be final
and binding on the parties. If disputes with respect to such Closing Date
Schedule or such Closing Statement cannot be resolved by Buyer and PII
within 30 calendar days after timely delivery of any objections thereto,
then, at the request of either Buyer or PII, the specific matters in dispute
shall be submitted to Ernst and Young LLP or such other independent accounting
firm as may be approved by PII and the Buyer (the "Auditors"), which
firm shall render its opinion as to such specific matters. If no such
referral is made within 45 days after the delivery of the objections, then
such Closing Date Schedule and such Closing Statement shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto. Based on such opinion, the Auditors will
then send to PII and the Buyer its determination of the specified matters in
dispute, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Auditors in any
court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Auditors shall be borne one-half
by the Sellers and one-half by the Buyer. 

   

 (c) If the Net Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Schedule as finally determined under Section 1.10(b) is less than $208,191,916 ("Base Net Working Capital"), then within five days following the final determination thereof, PII will pay, or cause the applicable Seller to pay, to the Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Buyer the amount of such deficiency, plus interest thereon at 6% per annum, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of such payment. If the Net Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Schedule is greater than Base Net Working Capital, then within five days following the final determination thereof, the Buyer will pay to PII, for the account and as agent of the applicable Seller, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by PII the amount of such excess, plus interest thereon at such interest rate from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of such payment.

made available to the Buyer true and complete copies of its corporate charter
and bylaws (or equivalent governing documents), in each case as amended

      #####

At the Closing, the Financing, together with the Buyers immediately available funds, in cash, will be sufficient to provide the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries with sufficient working capital and to pay any other amounts payable under this Agreement and to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, all without any third-party consent or approval required.

 (b) All such information and access shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement between the Buyer and PII dated April 23, 2007 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the Sellers, the Companies or any of their affiliates will have any obligation

consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by the Sellers or any of
their affiliates (excluding the Companies), or any related material.

 (d) The Sellers acknowledge that, subsequent to the Closing, they may be furnished with, receive or otherwise have access to, proprietary information of the Buyer, the Companies or their Subsidiaries (collectively, "Buyer Proprietary Information"). Subsequent to the Closing, the Sellers shall not disclose, and shall maintain the confidentiality of, all Buyer Proprietary Information. The Sellers shall use at least the same degree of care to safeguard and to prevent the disclosure, publication, dissemination, destruction, loss or alteration of the Buyer Proprietary Information as they employ to avoid unauthorized disclosure, publication, dissemination, destruction, loss or alteration of their own information (or information of its customers) of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care. Except as expressly provided herein, the Sellers shall not (A) use any Buyer Proprietary Information in any manner, (B) make any copies of any Buyer Proprietary Information, (C) acquire any right in or assert any Lien against any Buyer Proprietary Information, (D) sell, assign, transfer, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any Buyer Proprietary Information to third parties or commercially exploit any Buyer Proprietary Information, including through derivative works, or (E) refuse for any reason (including a default or breach of this Agreement by Buyer) to promptly provide any tangible embodiments of the Buyer Proprietary Information (including copies thereof) to Buyer if requested to do so, in the form reasonably requested. Except as may otherwise be provided in Section 4.2(c) or Section 4.7, none of the Buyer, the Companies and their Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates shall be obligated to disclose any Buyer Proprietary Information to the Sellers, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring on the Sellers, expressly or impliedly, any right, title, interest or license to any Buyer Proprietary Information or any components thereof. 

   

 (e) It is understood that the Sellers shall not have any liability or obligation hereunder with respect to any Buyer Proprietary Information that (i) at the time of disclosure or 

   ##### 

  

   

thereafter is generally available to and known by the public (other than as a
result of a disclosure or other act or omission by the Sellers or any of
their affiliates or any of their respective representatives after the
Closing), or (ii) the Sellers or any of their affiliates or any of
their respective representatives are legally required (by deposition,
interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process or by Law, governmental Proceeding, stock exchange rule or
court order) to disclose. In the event that the Sellers or any of their
affiliates or their representatives are requested or legally required (by
deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process or by Law, governmental Proceeding,
stock exchange rule or court order) to disclose any of the Buyer Proprietary
Information, the Sellers shall provide the Buyer with prompt written notice of
such request or requirement (together with a copy of the material proposed to
be disclosed) prior to any disclosure thereof, and the Sellers shall
cooperate with the Buyer so that the Buyer may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy or, if it so elects, waive compliance with
this Section 4.2. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, or the Buyer waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the
Sellers or any of their affiliates or their representatives, as the case may
be, may disclose only that portion of the Buyer Proprietary Information that
is legally required to be disclosed, _provided_ that the Buyer has been given
a reasonable opportunity to review the specifics of such disclosure before it
is made. The Sellers shall exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the information so
disclosed. Nothing provided in this Section 4.2 shall limit PII
from disclosing financial and other information with respect to the Companies
or the Business in satisfaction of its obligations as a publicly traded,
exchange-listed company. 

   

 (f) The Sellers will promptly request all persons who have heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such persons consideration of acquiring, directly or indirectly, the Business to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such persons by or on behalf of the Sellers, or any affiliate thereof, and will, or will cause any affiliate a party thereto to, enforce all obligations of such persons and all rights and remedies of the Sellers or such affiliate under such confidentiality agreements.

 (b) The Sellers and the Buyer shall file with any applicable Governmental Entity, all filings, reports, information and documentation required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers and the Buyer shall furnish to each others counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with its preparation of any such filing or submission.

The Sellers and the Buyer acknowledge and agree that, within seven days after the Closing, they will each file with the applicable Argentine Governmental Entities the filings 

   ##### 

  

   

required under the Argentine Antitrust Regulations. Each of the Sellers and
the Buyer shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in order to effect such

The Sellers acknowledge that any such consultation shall not constitute a waiver by the Buyer of any rights it may have under this Agreement, and that Buyer shall not have any liability or responsibility for any actions of any Seller or any of their respective officers or directors with respect to matters that are the subject of such consultations unless Buyer expressly consents to such action in writing.

 Section 4.6 _Public Announcements_.

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 4.7 _Tax Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Indemnification_. 

    

 (i) _Sellers  Indemnification of the Buyer. _The Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Buyer against (i) any Taxes imposed on any Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date, including Taxes payable in connection with the Proceedings listed in Section 2.10 and Section 2.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, (ii) any Taxes that may be imposed on any Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of being a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of corporations or other taxpayers at any time prior to the Closing, and (iii) any Taxes of any other person that may be imposed upon any Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of being a successor to such other person for Tax purposes prior to the Closing or as a result of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries being a party to a Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreement prior to the Closing, but, in each case, not including (A) any Transfer Taxes for which the Buyer is liable under Section 4.7(e) of this Agreement and (B) any Taxes, or portions thereof, resulting from a change in Law occurring after the Closing Date. 

   

 (ii) _Buyer s Indemnification of the Sellers. _The Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers from, against and in respect of any liability of the Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries for (i) any Taxes imposed on any Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) any Taxes that may be imposed on any Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of being a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of corporations or other taxpayers at any time after the Closing, (iii) any Taxes of any other person that may be imposed upon any Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of being a successor to such other person for Tax purposes after the Closing or as a result of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries being a party to a Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreement after the Closing, (iv) any Transfer Taxes for which the Buyer is liable under Section 4.7(e) of this Agreement, (v) any Taxes, or portions thereof, resulting from a change in Law occurring after the Closing Date and imposed on any Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date and (vi) any Tax liability resulting from an election by the Buyer under Section 338 of the Code. 

   

 (iii) _Section 338 and Similar Elections. _Not later than 30 business days after the Closing Date Schedule and Closing Statement become final and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 1.10(b) of this Agreement, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a schedule (the "Section 338 Schedule") of the estimated Foreign Tax Credit Loss Amount with respect to each Company and each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries eligible to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the purchase or deemed purchase of its shares (in each case, a "Target"). The "Foreign Tax Credit Loss Amount" with respect to any Target shall be equal to the excess of (A) the foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid by PII and its subsidiaries under Section 902 of the Code (whether by reason of Sections 301, 367(b), 960, 964(e) or 1248 or other relevant provisions of the Code) as a result of the transactions contemplated by Section 1.1 of this Agreement or dividends paid by PIIs subsidiaries in the taxable year that includes the Closing Date had no such election been made with respect to the purchase of shares of Target over (B) the foreign income taxes that will be deemed paid by PII and its subsidiaries under Section 902 of the Code (whether by reason of Sections 301, 367(b), 960, 964(e) or 1248 or other relevant provisions of the Code) as a result of the transactions contemplated by 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 1.1 of this Agreement or dividends paid by PIIs subsidiaries in the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date taking into account such election
made by Buyer. The Sellers shall also include on the Section 338 Schedule an
estimate of the taxable periods in which each portion of the lost tax benefit
corresponding to the aggregate Foreign Tax Credit Loss Amount with respect to
all Targets that would have been realized by PII and its subsidiaries had
no election under Section 338(g) of the Code been made with respect to any
Target. Not later than 5 business days after the Buyer or any of its
affiliates has made an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect
to any Target (an "Electing Target"), the Buyer shall notify the Sellers of
such election. The Buyer shall pay to PII, for the account and as agent of
each of the Sellers, that portion of the lost tax benefit corresponding to
the aggregate Foreign Tax Credit Loss Amount with respect to all Electing
Targets that would have been realized by PII and its subsidiaries in each
taxable period had no elections under Section 338(g) of the Code been made
with respect to the Electing Targets. The payment with respect to each
taxable period shall be due within 30 business days after PII notifies
the Buyer of the amount with respect to such taxable period, but in no case
earlier than the date that PII or its successor files the federal income tax
return for such taxable period. If as a result of an adjustment in a Tax
Audit (as defined below) or an amended Tax Return the amounts otherwise
computed above would be different, then the Buyer and PII will make payments
between them to reflect the consequences of such adjustment. 

  

 (b) _Allocation of Taxes and Earnings and Profits_. To the extent permitted by Law or administrative practice, the taxable years of the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall end at the close of business on the Closing Date. Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes, or the earnings and profits, of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a portion of a taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of the Taxes or the earnings and profits for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the taxable year or period ended at the close of business on the Closing Date, except that (A) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis and Taxes imposed on the ownership, use or operation of real or personal property shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days in the annual period elapsed through the Closing Date as compared to the number of days in the annual period elapsing after the Closing Date, and (B) any transaction that would be treated under the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-1(d) as occurring at the beginning of the day following the transaction shall be treated as occurring after the Closing Date. Whenever it is necessary to determine for any taxable period the amount of Taxes, or portions thereof, resulting from a change in Law occurring after the Closing Date, such amount shall equal the amount by which the Taxes imposed for such taxable period determined taking into account such change in Law exceed the Taxes that would have been imposed for such taxable period absent such change in Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Tax Returns_. Except as provided in Section 4.7(e): 

   

 (i) The Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed when due Tax Returns with respect to the Companies and their Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. The Sellers shall bear all costs of preparing such Tax Returns and shall timely pay any Taxes due on such Tax Returns with respect to the Companies and their Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. 

   

 (ii) The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed when due all other Tax Returns with respect to the Companies and their Subsidiaries. The Buyer shall bear all costs of preparing such Tax Returns and shall timely pay any Taxes due on such Tax Returns with respect to the Companies and their Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. 

   

 (iii) If either the Buyer or the Sellers may be liable for any portion of the Tax payable in connection with any Tax Return to be filed by the other, the party responsible under this Agreement for filing such return (the "Preparer") shall prepare and deliver to the other party (the "Payor") a copy of such return and any schedules, work papers and other documentation then available that are relevant to the preparation of the portion of such return for which the Payor is or may be liable under this Agreement not later than 45 days before the Due Date (as defined in Section 4.7(j) of this Agreement). The Preparer shall not file such return until the earlier of either the receipt of written notice from the Payor indicating the Payors consent thereto, or the Due Date. 

   

 (iv) The Buyer shall provide the Sellers with copies of all Tax Returns filed, or caused to be filed, by the Buyer with respect to the Companies and their Subsidiaries for periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing, and the Sellers shall provide the Buyer with copies of all Tax Returns filed, or caused to be filed, after the Closing Date by the Sellers with respect to the Companies and their Subsidiaries. The Sellers shall reimburse the Buyer for all Taxes allocated to the portion of the taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date on such Tax Returns, to the extent such Taxes have not been previously paid by the Sellers, any Company, or any Subsidiary of a Company to the relevant taxing authority. 

   

 (v) The Payor shall have the option of providing to the Preparer, at any time at least 15 days prior to the Due Date, written instructions as to how the Payor wants any, or all, of the items for which it may be liable reflected on such Tax Return. The Preparer shall, in preparing such return, cause the items for which the Payor is liable under this Agreement to be reflected in accordance with the Payors instructions (unless, in the opinion of a partner of an internationally recognized law or accounting firm retained by the Preparer, complying with the Payors instructions would likely subject the Preparer to any criminal penalty or a non-criminal penalty in an amount equal to at least 20% of the Tax on any such item) and, in the absence of having received such instructions, in accordance with past practice. The Payor shall pay to the Preparer the amount of the Taxes with respect to such Tax Return for which the Payor is liable not later than five days before such Tax Return is due. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vi) If the Preparer fails to satisfy its obligations under this Section 4.7(c), the Payor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Preparer for any incremental Taxes that are reflected on any such return as a result of such failure or any related Loss, and shall retain any and all remedies it may otherwise have that arise out of such failure. 

   

 (d) _Contest Provisions._  

   

 (i) Notification of Contests. After the date hereof, each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand (the "Recipient"), shall notify the Sellers or the Buyer, as the case may be, in writing within five days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments, assessments or other proceedings (a "Tax Audit") that may affect the liability for Taxes of such other party. If the Recipient fails to give such prompt notice to the other party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit if such failure to give notice adversely affects the other partys right to participate in the Tax Audit. 

   

 (ii) _Which Party Controls._  

   

 (A) _Sellers  Items. _If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes for which the Sellers are liable under this Agreement, the Sellers shall, at their expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. 

   

 (B) _Buyer s Items. _If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes for which the Buyer is liable under this Agreement, the Buyer shall, at its expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. 

   

 (C) _Combined and Mixed Items._ If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both the Sellers and the Buyer are liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable such Tax Items (as defined in Section 4.7(j)) will be distinguished and each party will control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable. 

   

 (D) _Inseparable Items._ If such Tax Audit relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning before and ending after the Closing Date and any Tax Item cannot be identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item for which the other party is liable, the Sellers shall control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit, provided that the Sellers defend the items as reported on the relevant Tax Return, otherwise the Buyer shall control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit. 

  

 (e) _Transfer Taxes._ All excise, sales, use, value added, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes, levies, assessments, customs, duties, imposts, charges or fees, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly from the sale and transfer by the Sellers to the Buyer of the Shares (the "Transfer Taxes"), shall be borne fully by the Buyer. Notwithstanding Section 4.7(c) of this Agreement, which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax 

   ##### 

  

   

Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to
the other party at least 10 days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Returns.
If, pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, a Seller is required to
file a Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes, the Buyer shall pay to such
Seller the Transfer Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return no later than five
days after a Seller has provided a copy of such Tax Return to the Buyer. 

   

 (f) _Buyer s Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds, Overpayments and Prepayments. _If, after the Closing, the Buyer, any Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) receives any refund (whether by payment, offset, credit or otherwise) or (B) utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes (including any overpayment that results in a value-added Tax asset or credit) that, in each case (A) and (B), (x) relates to Taxes for which the Sellers are liable or paid by the Sellers, any Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date, or (y) is the subject of indemnification by the Sellers under this Agreement, the Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the Sellers the entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest) received or utilized by the Buyer, any Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, a prepayment on or before the Closing Date of Taxes for which the Buyer is liable shall be treated in the same manner as an overpayment of Taxes for which the Sellers are liable. The Buyer agrees to notify the Sellers within 15 days following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. The Buyer agrees to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as possible and to furnish to the Sellers all information, records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment. 

   

 (g) In the event the liability of or with respect to Taxes for which the Sellers are liable hereunder is increased and the particular item that produced such increase results, directly or indirectly, in an actual or potential reduction in the liability of the Buyer or its affiliates for Taxes (a "Buyer Tax Benefit"), the Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay to the Sellers the amount of such Buyer Tax Benefit; provided that such amount shall not exceed the amount of the additional Taxes payable by the Sellers resulting from such item (a "Seller Tax Detriment"). Such payment shall be made within 30 days after the later of (i) the due date (without regard to waivers or extensions) of the Tax Return for the Tax period during which the Buyer Tax Benefit was realized or (ii) the date notice is given by the Sellers to the Buyer with respect to such payment. In the event of the later adjustment, in whole or in part, of any item that produced the Buyer Tax Benefit or the Seller Tax Detriment, the Sellers shall refund to the Buyer any amount previously paid under this Section 4.7(g) that is determined not to be owing as a result of such adjustment, or the Buyer shall further remit to the Sellers the amount of any increase in the amount required to be paid under this Section 4.7(g) as a result of such adjustment. The parties shall promptly notify each other of any Buyer Tax Benefit or Seller Tax Detriment and provide details supporting the calculation of the amount thereof. The amount of any Buyer Tax Benefit or Seller Tax Detriment shall be calculated by comparing the Taxes payable without the adjustment in question with the Taxes payable after taking into account such adjustment, without regard to loss carryforwards or carrybacks. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (h) _Post-Closing Actions That Affect the Sellers  Liability for Taxes_. Neither the Buyer, any Company nor any affiliate of any of them shall take any action (including amending any Tax Return) on or after the Closing Date that could materially increase the Sellers (or Sellers shareholders) liability for Taxes (including any liability of the Sellers to indemnify the Buyer for Taxes under this Agreement and any liability of Sellers or their direct or indirect shareholders for Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 951 through 964 of the Code), without the prior written consent of PII. 

   

 (i) _Assistance and Cooperation._ The parties agree that, after the Closing Date: 

    

 (i) Each party shall assist (and cause its affiliates to assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns that such other party is responsible for preparing and filing; 

   

 (ii) The parties shall cooperate fully in preparing for any Tax Audits, or disputes with taxing authorities, relating to any Tax Returns or Taxes of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including providing access, as reasonably needed, to relevant books and records relating to Taxes at issue; 

   

 (iii) The parties shall make available to each other and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested all relevant books and records relating to Taxes; 

   

 (iv) Each party shall promptly furnish the other party with copies of all relevant correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax Audit or information request relating to Taxes for which such other party may have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement; and 

   

 (v) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the party requesting assistance or cooperation shall bear the other partys out-of-pocket expenses in complying with such request to the extent that those expenses are attributable to fees and other costs of unaffiliated third-party service providers. 

  

 (j) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean taxes of any kind, levies or other like assessments, customs, duties, imposts, charges or fees, including income taxes, gross receipts, ad valorem, value added, excise, real or property, asset, sales, use, license, payroll, transaction, capital, net worth, withholding, estimated, social security, utility, workers compensation, severance, production, unemployment compensation, occupation, premium, windfall profits, transfer and gains taxes or other governmental taxes imposed or payable to the United States, or any state, county, local or foreign government or subdivision or agency thereof, together with any interest, penalties or additions with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties; "Due Date" shall mean, with respect to any Tax Return, the date such return is due to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions); and "Tax Item" shall mean, with respect to Taxes, any item of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit or other tax attribute. 

   

 Section 4.8 _Withholding Taxes_. Any payments from the Buyer to the Sellers hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes, 

   ##### 

  

   

unless such deduction or withholding is required by applicable Law. If the
Buyer is required by applicable Law to deduct or withhold Taxes from such
payments, then the Buyer shall pay, in addition to the amount otherwise due
to Sellers hereunder, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that
the net amount actually paid to Sellers will equal the full amount Sellers
would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. 

   

 Section 4.9 _Employees; Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (a) The Buyer shall be permitted to offer employment to any of the employees of any subsidiary of PII (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) who are identified in Section 4.9(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "Operating Employees"), provided that the Buyer shall condition such employment on the resignation of the Operating Employee from his or her employer that is PII or any affiliate of PII so that the Operating Employees termination of employment with PII or any affiliate of PII shall not give rise to any benefit under any applicable severance plan. The Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless PII and its affiliates for severance or similar benefits made to any Operating Employee who accepts employment with the Buyer effective as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) The Buyer agrees that, for a period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, it will not, and will cause any of its affiliates not to, directly or indirectly solicit the employment of any of the employees of PII or its affiliates, other than the Operating Employees and the employees of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that a general advertisement or general solicitation for potential employees shall not be considered a breach of this Section 4.9(b), and a decision to hire any employee of PII or its affiliates who applies in response to such solicitation shall not be considered a breach of this Section 4.9(b). 

   

 (c) On and after the Closing, until at least the first anniversary of the Closing, the Buyer shall provide the employees and former employees of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Operating Employees who accept employment with the Buyer (the employees of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Operating Employees who accept employment with the Buyer are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Affected Employees") with compensation and benefits substantially similar in the aggregate than those provided by PII or the applicable affiliate of PII immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) If any Affected Employee becomes a participant in (i) any "employee benefit plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, (ii) any plan that would be an employee benefit plan if it were subject to ERISA or the Code, such as plans outside the jurisdiction of the United States, (iii) any bonus, deferred compensation, excess benefit, or incentive compensation plan, (iv) any supplemental unemployment, sick leave, vacation pay, long-term disability, post-retirement medical or life insurance, and (v) any other plan, program, policy, or arrangement providing benefits to employees (collectively, "Benefit Plans") of the Buyer or any of its affiliates (a "Buyer Plan"), such employee shall be given credit under such Buyer Plan for all service prior to the Closing Date with PII or the employer affiliate (to the extent such credit was given by PII or the employer affiliate) and all service prior to the time each employee becomes such a participant, for purposes of eligibility and vesting and for all other purposes for which such service is either taken into account or recognized (other than for 

    ##### 

  

    

purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit plans); provided, however,
such service need not be credited to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits. The Buyer shall amend or cause to be amended any of
the Buyer Plans to the extent necessary to recognize all service of the
Affected Employees as required by this Section 4.9(d). 

   

 (e) In the event that any person who is an employee of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing is discharged by the Buyer, any Company or such Subsidiary, or is deemed discharged or can bring a claim of discharge, as of or after the Closing Date, then the Buyer shall be responsible for any severance costs for such employee including (i) such severance costs that become payable under applicable Law and (ii) costs as set forth in Section 4.9(e) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The Buyer shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices or payments due to any such employees, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments due to any law (including common law), statute or ordinance of any nation or state or any regulation, policy, protocol, proclamation or executive order promulgated by any union representing Affected Employees or any national, federal, regional, state, local or other governmental agency, authority, administrative agency, regulatory body, commission, instrumentality, court, official or arbitral tribunal having governmental or quasi-governmental powers with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees by Buyer or any affiliate as of or after the Closing, including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any rules or regulations as have been issued in connection with the foregoing. 

   

 (f) If an Affected Employee is participating in a Benefit Plan sponsored by PII or any of its subsidiaries that provides health benefits, whether or not subject to U.S. Law, immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees that, upon the Closing, such Affected Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in a Buyer Plan that provides health benefits, and Buyer shall credit such Affected Employee under such Buyer Plan, for the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs, with the deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions and any other applicable expenses already incurred during the portion of the year preceding the Closing Date under the applicable Benefit Plan sponsored by PII or any of its subsidiaries that provides health benefits. The Buyer shall be responsible and assume all liability for obligations, if any, relating to post-retirement welfare plans covering the Affected Employees or former employees of any Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which obligation is summarized in Section 4.9(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (g) The Buyer acknowledges that, at the Closing, the participation by each of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries in all Benefit Plans not sponsored or maintained solely by any of the Companies and such Subsidiaries shall terminate, and the Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing any successor or alternate plans. 

   

 (h) The Buyer shall cause the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to honor any collective bargaining agreements identified on Section 2.5 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (i) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless, the Sellers and their respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates and agents and the fiduciaries (including plan administrators) of the Benefit Plans, from 

    ##### 

  

    

and against, any and all claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) and other liabilities and
obligations relating to or arising out of (i) all compensation,
salaries, commissions and vacation entitlements accrued but unpaid as of the
Closing and post-Closing bonuses due to any Affected Employee, (ii) the
liabilities assumed by the Buyer under this Section 4.9 or any failure by the
Buyer to comply with the provisions of this Section 4.9, and (iii) any
claims of, or damages or penalties sought by, any Affected Employee, any
national, federal, regional, state, local or other governmental agency,
authority, administrative agency, regulatory body, commission,
instrumentality, court, official or arbitral tribunal having governmental
or quasi-governmental powers on behalf of or concerning any Affected
Employee, or any union representing any Affected Employee, with respect to
any act or failure to act by the Buyer to the extent arising from the
employment, discharge, layoff or termination of any Affected Employee on
or after the Closing Date. 

   

 Section 4.10 _Supplemental Disclosure_. The Sellers shall have the right from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Letter with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered that if existing or known at the date of this Agreement would have been required to be set forth or described in such Seller Disclosure Letter. Any such supplemental or amended disclosure will not be considered when determining whether the condition set forth in Section 5.3(a) or any other condition to Closing has been satisfied. Such supplemental or amended disclosure will, however, for purposes of determining whether any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2, be deemed to amend the Seller Disclosure Letter to reflect the matters set forth in such disclosure and to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 4.11 _Advice of Changes_. The Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, will give prompt notice to the other upon becoming aware of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date. Except as set forth in Section 4.10 or Section 7.1, no notice pursuant to this Section 4.11 will affect any representations or warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or conditions set forth herein or limit or otherwise affect any available remedies. 

   

 Section 4.12 _Performance Bonds_. If any Seller or any of its affiliates (other than any Company or any of its Subsidiaries) has posted a performance, local import or other similar bond, letter of credit or other guarantee in connection with the operation of the Business, the Buyer and such Seller shall cooperate with each other in order (i) for such Seller or any such affiliate to obtain the release of any such bond, letter of credit or guarantee and (ii) to the extent required, for the Buyer to obtain a substitute bond, letter of credit or guarantee or to assume such Sellers or such affiliates existing bond, letter of credit or guarantee. The Buyer shall reimburse such Seller for all costs incurred by such Seller or any such affiliate as a result of such Sellers or such affiliates leaving a performance, local import or similar bond, letter of credit or other guarantee in place after the Closing Date in order to permit the Buyer to operate the Business after the Closing Date. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 4.13 _Restricted Activities_. 

   

 (a) In consideration of the payment of the Purchase Price, and to further induce the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, PII hereby agrees that, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing for a period of three years from the Closing Date, neither PII nor any of its subsidiaries, during the period an entity is a subsidiary, will directly or indirectly, either acting on its own behalf or through or in connection with any person, (i) engage in, invest in or derive any profit from Restricted Activities in the Territory (each as defined below); (ii) solicit, recruit or hire any employee of the Companies and their Subsidiaries; or (iii) solicit or encourage any employee of the Company and such Subsidiaries to leave the employment of the Company and such Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that a general advertisement or general solicitation for potential employees shall not be considered a breach of this Section 4.13(a), and a decision to hire any employee of any Company or any such Subsidiary who applies in response to such solicitation shall not be considered a breach of this Section 4.13(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.13 shall not restrict: (i) the ownership by PII or any of its subsidiaries of less than an aggregate of 20% of any class of stock of a person engaged, directly or indirectly, in Restricted Activities within the Territory; or (ii) the acquisition and continued ownership by PII or any of its subsidiaries of any person that, prior to the acquisition thereof, is not an affiliate of PII and that engages, directly or indirectly, in Restricted Activities within the Territory (A) if such Restricted Activities within the Territory account for less than 20% of such persons consolidated annual revenues for its most recently completed fiscal year or (B) if PII or such subsidiary disposes of or agrees to dispose of or discontinues such persons business engaged in Restricted Activities within the Territory within one year after the closing of such acquisition. 

   

 (b) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and restrictions contained in this Section 4.13 are an essential element of the Buyers agreeing to acquire the Shares and pay the Purchase Price as set forth herein, and that the Buyer would not have done so but for the agreement by PII to comply with the terms and provisions of this Section 4.13. 

   

 (c) Each Seller hereby agrees that the geographic and business scope and the duration of the covenants and restrictions in this Section 4.13 are fair and reasonable. However, if any provision of this Section 4.13 is held to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of the geographic or business scope or duration thereof, the court or other tribunal is hereby directed to construe and enforce this Section 4.13 as if the geographic or business scope or the duration or such provision has been more narrowly drawn as so not to be invalid or unenforceable, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect or render invalid or unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Section 4.13, (i) the term "Restricted Activities" means the business of providing (x) services using land drilling or land workover rigs or (y) pressure pumping, formation testing, underbalance drilling, drilling fluids, directional drilling, fishing tools or production services with respect to onshore oil and natural gas wells; and (ii) the term "Territory" shall mean Mexico, Central America and South America. 

   

 Section 4.14 _Financing_. The Buyer shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms 

   ##### 

  

   

and conditions described in the Financing Commitment (provided that the Buyer
may replace or amend the Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, or otherwise replace or amend
the Financing Commitment so long as (a) after such actions, the Financing
Commitment does not include any additional conditions precedent that are not
contained in the Financing Commitment provided to the Sellers as of the date
of this Agreement, and (b) such actions are not reasonably likely to delay,
or diminish the likelihood of, the Buyer obtaining the Financing (clauses (a)
and (b) together being referred to as the "Financing Modification
Requirements"; for purposes of this Agreement, the term "Financing
Commitment" shall be deemed to include any such replacement or amended
financing), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Financing Commitment or any Alternative Financing (as defined
below), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Buyer
to obtaining the Financing set forth therein, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitment or any Alternative
Financing, and (iv) consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing at or
prior to the Closing. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing
Commitment, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms and conditions that are
not materially less beneficial to the Buyer than those contained in the
Financing Commitment as in effect on the date of this Agreement as determined
in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Buyer and consistent with the
Financing Modification Requirements (any such alternative financing actually
obtained by the Buyer, "Alternative Financing") as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event.

 (d) by PII, if the Buyer breaches or fails to perform its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or breaches or failure or failures to perform (i) would, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.2(a) or (b) and (ii) cannot be cured or, if curable, is not or are not cured within 10 days after written notice from PII; or 

   

 (e) by the Buyer, if one or more of the Sellers breach or fail to perform their representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or breaches or failure or failures to perform (i) would, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.3(a) or (b) and (ii) cannot be cured or, if curable, is not or are not cured within 10 days after written notice from the Buyer; 

 

 _provided, however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to clause

one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, and except that the
obligations provided for in Section 6.2, Section 8.6, Section 8.9 and Section

The representations and warranties shall survive the Closing for the relevant period (the "Survival Period") determined as follows: (a) the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section 2.1, Section 2.2, Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 of this Agreement and of the Buyer contained in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 of this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely; (b) the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section 2.12, Section 2.13, Section 2.14 and Section 2.17 shall survive until the expiration of 90 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or prescription period (after giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof); and (c) all other representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Article II of this Agreement and of the Buyer contained in Article III of this Agreement shall survive until the expiration of a period of 18 months following the Closing Date.

Except as expressly provided in Section 4.10, any claim by an indemnified party for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any investigation by or opportunity to investigate afforded to such party, nor shall such a claim be adversely affected by such partys knowledge on or before the Closing of any breach of the type specified in Section 7.2(a)(i) or (ii) or Section 7.3(a)(i) or (ii) unless it shall be determined by a final judgment of a Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over such Proceeding that the party seeking indemnification had actual and express knowledge of such breach on or before the Closing.

arising out of or resulting from: 

    

 (i) a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article II of this Agreement when made or at and as of the Closing Date (or at and as of such different date or period specified for such representation or warranty) as though such representation and warranty were made at and as of the Closing Date (or such different date or period);

 (i) a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article III of this Agreement when made or at and as of the Closing Date (or at and as of such different date or period specified for such representation or warranty) as though such representation and warranty were made at and as of the Closing Date (or such different date or period);

If a Seller Indemnitee actually receives any amount under insurance coverage or from such other party with respect to Seller Damages at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by the Buyer under this Section 7.3, then such Seller Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Buyer, as the case may be, for any payment made by the Buyer in connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount received by the Seller Indemnitee; and 

   

 (iv) The Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) only for those claims giving rise to Seller Damages as to which the Seller Indemnitees have given the Buyer written notice thereof prior to the end of the Survival Period.

 Section 7.4 _Third-Party Indemnification_. The obligations of PII to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 7.2 of this Agreement with respect to Buyer Damages and the obligations of the Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees under Section 7.3 of this Agreement with respect to Seller Damages, in either case resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties (each, as the case may be, a "Claim"), will be subject to the following terms and conditions: 

   

 (a) Any party against whom any Claim is asserted will give the indemnifying party written notice of any such Claim promptly after learning of such Claim, and the indemnifying party may, at its option, undertake the defense of such Claim by counsel of its own choosing; _provided_ that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim under this Agreement shall not affect the indemnifying partys obligations under this Article VII, except to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give prompt notice. If the indemnifying party, within 30 days after notice of any such Claim, or such shorter period as is reasonably required, fails to assume the defense of such Claim, the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, against whom such Claim has been made will (upon further notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the expense, of the indemnifying party. 

   

 (b) Anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any action, suit or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment (i) that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Seller Indemnitee or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be, of a written release from all liability in respect of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) for other than monetary 

   ##### 

  

    

damages to be borne by the indemnifying party, without the prior written
consent of the Seller Indemnitee or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (c) The indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall cooperate fully in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which indemnity is sought under this Article VII, including by providing the other party with reasonable access to employees and officers (including as witnesses) and other information. 

  

 Section 7.5 _No Setoff_. Neither the Buyer nor PII shall have any right to setoff any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, respectively, against any payments to be made by either of them under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.6 _Insurance_. The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to the rights of any indemnified party in respect of any insurance relating to Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be, to the extent of any indemnification payments made under this Agreement, and the indemnified party shall provide all reasonably requested assistance to the indemnifying party in respect of such subrogation. 

   

 Section 7.7 _No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts (i) giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) taken into account in determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 1.10(c). Article VII shall not apply to Tax claims to the extent those claims are separately indemnified under Section 4.7. 

   

 Section 7.8 _Sole Remedy_. 

   

 (a) The parties agree that the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of any party to this Agreement, any Buyer Indemnitee or any Seller Indemnitee or their respective affiliates with respect to this Agreement or any other claims relating to the Business, the events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions provided for in this Agreement or contemplated by this Agreement or by any other such claims relating to the Business, events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions provided for in this Agreement (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be limited to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 4.7 and this Article VII and, in furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, waives and releases the other parties to this Agreement (and such other parties affiliates) from, to the fullest extent permitted under any applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or its affiliates may have against the other parties to this Agreement (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 4.7 and this Article VII. 

   

 (b) The parties intend that, even though indemnification and other obligations appear in various sections and articles of this Agreement, the indemnification procedures and limitations contained in this Article VII shall apply to all indemnity and other obligations of the 

   ##### 

  

   

parties under this Agreement, except as provided in Section 4.7 and except to
the extent expressly excluded in this Article VII. 

   

 Section 7.9 _No Special Damages_. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY BUYER DAMAGES OR SELLER DAMAGES HEREUNDER INCLUDE EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE PAYABLE TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM. 

   

 Section 7.10 _Express Negligence_. THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

 Section 8.6 _Dispute Resolution_. 

   

 (a) _Negotiation; Mediation_. 

    

 (i) In the event of any dispute or disagreement between the Sellers and the Buyer as to the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement (or the performance of obligations under this Agreement), the matter, on written request of either party, shall be referred to representatives of the parties for decision, each party being represented by a senior executive officer who has no direct operational responsibility for the matters contemplated by this Agreement (the "Representatives"). The Representatives shall promptly meet in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute. If the Representatives do not agree upon a decision within 30 calendar days after reference of

exercise the remedies available to it under Section 8.6(b). 

   

 (ii) The Representatives may elect at any time to undertake mediation.

 (b) _Arbitration_. 

    

 (i) Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions arising hereunder that cannot be resolved by negotiation or mediation pursuant to Section 8.6(a) shall be settled exclusively by final and binding arbitration in New York, New York. Such arbitration will apply the laws of the State of New York and the commercial arbitration rules of AAA to resolve the dispute.

Each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and those appointed arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator, who shall be the presiding arbitrator.

The arbitrators shall render their award within 90 days of the conclusion of the arbitration hearing. The arbitrators shall not be empowered to award to either party any punitive damages in connection with any dispute between them, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to recover such damages.

   ##### 

  

    

shall be final and not subject to judicial review and judgment thereon may be
entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 Section 8.10 _Interpretation_. 

   

 (a) The phrase "to the knowledge of the Sellers" or any similar phrase shall mean such facts and other information that as of the date of this Agreement are actually known to the persons listed in Section 8.10 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

   

 (b) As used in this Agreement:

 Section 8.12 _No Waivers_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any party, and no course of dealing between the parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. No waiver by a party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any such prior or subsequent occurrence. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced. 

   

 Section 8.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement and immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.
