_Agreement_ "), is among Plato Learning, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Project Cayman Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Archipelago Learning, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used in this
Agreement are used as defined in _Section 8.13_.

Recitals

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company and Merger Sub
have approved and declared advisable, and the board of directors of Parent has
approved, this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions
provided for in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to the CompanyÂ’s willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Thoma Bravo Fund X, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the " _Guarantor_
"), has provided a guarantee (the " _Limited Guaranty_ ") in favor of the
Company, in the form set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, with respect to the
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations under this
Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent has required as a condition to its willingness to enter into
this Agreement that certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Supporting
Stockholders_ ") enter into Support Agreements, each dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Support Agreements_ "), simultaneously herewith, pursuant to
which, among other things, each Supporting Stockholder has agreed to vote to
adopt this Agreement and take certain other actions in furtherance of the
Merger, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for
in the Support Agreements.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (Central Standard Time) on a date to be specified by
the parties, which date shall be no later than the second Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in  _Article VI_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time),
at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 300 N. LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL
60654, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later
time as is mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and shall immediately
thereafter be amended to read in substantially the form as the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

 

SECTION 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 



2 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company as treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive $11.10 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of: (i) a certificate which represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), or (ii) any non-
certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by a book-entry (each,
a " _Book-Entry Share_ "), in each case, that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares
in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest.

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than any holders in respect
of shares of Company Restricted Stock set forth on _Section 2.2_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the
holders of Options, Company RSUs, Dividend Equivalents or Shadow Options) in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms
reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_. Parent shall deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the
Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, in accordance with
ParentÂ’s instructions and pending its disbursement to such holders, be
invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated
the highest quality by either MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
PoorÂ’s Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a
combination of the foregoing. No such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced
by, such investments will, at ParentÂ’s direction, be distributed to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (other than the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any Subsidiary of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, holders of Company Restricted Stock in respect
of such shares of Company Restricted Stock set forth in _Section 2.2_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or holders of Dissenting Shares who have not
subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of appraisal): (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the
Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other
customary provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agentÂ’s message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form)
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or upon receipt
of an agentÂ’s message in the case of Book-Entry Shares), together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or held in book-entry form, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates representing Company Common Stock
held by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this _Article II_, without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and at
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-

 



4  Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last
sentence of _Section 2.2(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
delivery of a written indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or investment
income received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to a holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Stock, Options, Company
RSUs, Dividend Equivalents or Shadow Options or amounts otherwise payable
under this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. If any withholding obligation may be
avoided by such Person providing information or documentation to Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such information
shall be requested prior to any such withholding.

 



5 SECTION 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, then, as of the occurrence of such event or the Effective
Time, whichever last occurs, each of such holderÂ’s Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be a Dissenting Share and shall be converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
_Section 2.1_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent
reasonable notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Common Stock, offer to settle
or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

SECTION 2.4 _Company Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to provide that each option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) that represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock (each, an " _Option_ ," and collectively, " _Options_ ") shall, as of
the Effective Time, be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right to
receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock then subject to the Option. The Option Consideration
shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll system within
five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common
Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over
(ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common
Stock issuable under such Option. For the avoidance of doubt, each Option
with an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Option that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled and terminated and no Option Consideration shall be payable with
respect thereto.

 



6 SECTION 2.5 _Company Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each share of
Company Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other restrictions and any
accrued stock dividends with respect thereto (each, a share of " _Company
Restricted Stock_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is vested or that, upon consummation of the Merger, will
automatically vest in accordance with its terms, shall, as of the Effective
Time, be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right to receive a
payment in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, together with accrued cash
dividends (if any). For the avoidance of doubt, any share of Company
Restricted Stock that is unvested at the Effective Time and that is
not automatically vested pursuant to its terms upon consummation of the
Merger shall be forfeited as of the Effective Time, without any consideration
paid to the holder thereof.

SECTION 2.6 _Company Restricted Stock Units; Dividend Equivalents_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide
that each restricted stock unit (a " _Company RSU_ ") and related dividend
equivalent right (a " _Dividend Equivalent_ ") granted subject to vesting or
other restrictions that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall, as of the Effective Time,
be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right of the individuals set
forth on _Section 2.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule to receive a
payment in cash equal to such percentage of the Merger Consideration as is
set forth in _Section 2.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with
an amount equal to the corresponding percentage of the per share dividends
accrued to such Dividend Equivalent (if any) (the " _Dividend Consideration_
"). The Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Company RSUs and any
Dividend Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation through its
payroll system within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date.

SECTION 2.7 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. No later than the earlier
to occur of (i) the last day of the CompanyÂ’s regularly scheduled payroll
period following the Offer Period (as defined in the CompanyÂ’s Amended and
Restated 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) in progress on
the date of this Agreement and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the then-current Offer Period shall terminate
(the " _Final Date_ ") and the payroll deductions of each ESPP participant
accumulated as of the Final Date in each participantÂ’s Payroll Account (as
defined in the ESPP) shall be used to purchase that number of whole shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP (taking into
account a participantÂ’s withdrawal rights under the ESPP), which number of
shares shall be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(c)_. The board of directors
of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") or the compensation committee
thereof shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to provide that with respect to the ESPP: (i) participants may
not increase their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of
this Agreement or make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or
following the date of this Agreement; (ii) no new participants may enroll to
commence participation in the ESPP following the date of this Agreement;
(iii) no new Offer Period under the ESPP may commence following the date of
this Agreement; (iv) the Offer Period in progress on the date of this
Agreement shall not be modified or extended in any way; and (v) the ESPP
shall terminate immediately following the Final Date and no further rights
shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

 



7 SECTION 2.8 _Shadow Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to provide that each shadow option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) that represents the right to receive a cash payment based on the
value of the Company Common Stock upon the occurrence of certain events
(each, a " _Shadow Option_ ," and collectively, _Shadow Options_ ") shall, as
of the Effective Time, be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right
to receive a cash amount equal to the Shadow Option Consideration. The Shadow
Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation through its
payroll system within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Shadow Option Consideration_ " means, with
respect to each Shadow Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i)
the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the date
of grant price of (A) $10.09, in the case of a Shadow Option granted in 2011,
or (B) $9.97, in the case of a Shadow Option granted in 2012. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Shadow Option with a date of grant price set forth in
clause (ii) above that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled and terminated and no Shadow Option Consideration shall be
payable with respect thereto.

in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or

the avoidance of doubt, this clause (D) shall not preclude either party from
asserting that the underlying cause of any such change in stock price or
trading volume or failure is a Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ , that in

occurrences or effects do not affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in a
materially disproportionate manner as compared to other participants such

standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by

excluding employee discounts, holidays, holiday gifts, business gifts, Company
events, business expense reimbursements, business travel, use of Company
equipment or services, salary rates, wage rates, overtime, shift
differentials, payroll practices, or other benefits or compensation that
either (A) are terminable at any time without liability as to future events or
occurrences or (B) are of a type that has been included as a liability, cost
or expense in the CompanyÂ’s financial statements within the preceding five
years), in each case which are not government programs or statutory benefits
and as to which the Company or any Subsidiary has any obligation or
liability, contingent or otherwise (collectively, the " _Company Plans_ ").

otherwise, under ERISA or the Code with respect to any "employee benefit plan"

compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws. Except as
disclosed in  _Section 3.11(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all
Company Plans that are intended to be tax qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code have received a current favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of such Company Plan (after
taking into account, after any event or condition which could adversely affect
the qualification of any such plan, commercially reasonable actions to
maintain such qualification that do not result in a material liability to the
Company taken as a whole). Except with respect to Company Benefit Plans set
forth in _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as required by
Law, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation under any
Company Benefit Plan to provide any post-termination health or life insurance
benefits coverage to any Person other than (i) as mandated by Section 4980B

claims, proceedings, audits, investigations, suits or actions pending or, to

Company Plans that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, other than routine claims for benefits. There has been no non-
exempt "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) and no breach of fiduciary duty (as determined under
ERISA) with respect to any Company Plan that would result in liability to the
Company or any Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each Company Plan, all contributions,
distributions, reimbursements and premium payments that are due have been made
and all contributions, distributions, reimbursements and premium payments for
any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due have been
made or properly accrued. With respect to each Company Plan, all
contributions, distributions, reimbursements and premium payments that are
due have been timely made before any material, additional penalty or liability
has been incurred (excluding any such penalties or liabilities that are
reflected in the CompanyÂ’s financial statements).

 

(g) Except as disclosed on _Section 3.11(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby will (alone or in
combination with any other event) (i) result in any payment becoming due to
any current or former employee, officer, or director of the Company or
any Subsidiary or satisfy any prerequisite to any payment or benefit to any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary, (ii) increase any benefits or compensation under any Company Plan
or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or
funding of any benefits or compensation under any Company Plan.

employment and labor practices, including, without limitation, those
applicable Laws relating to equal opportunity employment, employment
discrimination and harassment, collective bargaining, immigration, layoffs,
worker classification (including proper classification of workers as
independent contractors and consultants), wages and hours, occupational safety
and health, and the withholding and payment of all required employment taxes,
other than instances of noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

reasonably be expected to give rise to a Material Adverse Effect, (A) each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is and has for the past three (3) years been

released or exposed any person to any hazardous substance or petroleum, or, to

no such property or facility is or has been contaminated by any such
substance), in a manner that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Environmental Laws.
To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has made available to Parent
copies of all environmental reports, assessments or other material
environmental documents relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their
business, or any properties or facilities currently or formerly owned, leased

Lender, and such Affiliates, the " _Lender Parties_ ") (the " _Debt Financing
Commitment_ "), regarding the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the Merger, the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and related fees and expenses (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and (b) the executed
equity commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, among
Parent, Merger Sub and the Sponsor (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ " and

arrangements or understandings relating to the funding of the Financing or the
terms thereof, other than the terms thereof set forth in the Financing
Commitments and except for fee letters with respect to fees, market flex and
related arrangements with respect to the Debt Financing (which documents do
not relate to the aggregate amount of, conditionality of, or contain any
conditions precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing). Assuming the
Financing Commitments are funded, Parent and Merger Sub will have at the
Closing funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and to pay
all of fees and expenses relating to the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a

Date. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment and other fees that have
been incurred and are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof in

the other terms and conditions required to be satisfied pursuant to the terms
of the Financing Commitments on or prior to the date hereof, and Parent will

Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Limited Guaranty,
dated as of the date hereof, in favor of the Company, in the form set forth
in _Exhibit A_ hereto. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect as of
the date hereof and no event has occurred which, with or without the giving of
notice or the lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Limited Guaranty.

Consideration and aggregate Dividend Consideration and payment of all related
fees and expenses payable in connection with the Transactions, and (b) any
estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries have
been prepared by them in good faith based upon assumptions that were and
continue to be reasonable, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 4.8_, the term " _Solvent_ " with
respect to any Person means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person exceeds, as
of such date, the sum of (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such

Laws governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; and (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the business in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date; and (c)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For the purposes of this definition, "not
have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" mean that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

 

SECTION 4.9 _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns any
shares of Company Common Stock, beneficially, of record or otherwise, as of

SECTION 4.11 _Investigations; Litigation_. There are no (a) suits,
claims, actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (b) Orders to which Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties is or are subject, in
each case, that would reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder or
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions on a timely
basis.

SECTION 4.12 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokerÂ’s, finderÂ’s,
financial advisorÂ’s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the

36 SECTION 5.2 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) Provided there shall not have been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
permitted by _Sections 5.4(d)_ or _5.4(e)_  hereof, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare the Proxy
Statement, (ii) Parent shall promptly provide to the Company any information
required for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide such
other information or assistance in the preparation thereof as may be
reasonably requested by the Company and (iii) the Company shall file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC. The Company shall thereafter use its commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable
after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC (the " _SEC Clearance Date_
"); _provided_ , that if the SEC has failed to affirmatively notify the
Company within ten (10) calendar days after the filing of the Proxy
Statement with the SEC that it will not review the Proxy Statement, then the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confirmation
from the SEC that it will not comment on, or that it has no additional
comments on, the Proxy Statement and the date on which the Company receives
such confirmation shall be the "SEC Clearance Date." Subject to _Sections
5.4(d)_ and _5.4(e)_ , the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board
Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall give
due consideration to including in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or response comments reasonably and timely proposed by
Parent.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall
provide such other party with copies of all correspondence between such party
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the
other hand. In the event that the Company or Parent receives any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement, each such party shall promptly provide
to the other any information or assistance as may reasonably be requested by
the other party in connection with the response to such comments or such
request. As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC
and after the furnishing by the Company and Parent of all information
required to be contained therein, the Company shall, in consultation with the
Parent, prepare and file any required amendments to the Proxy Statement with
the SEC.

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should be
discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the
Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the shareholders of
the Company.

 



37 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall not be required
to solicit proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval unless the Company Board thereafter reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation.

 

SECTION 5.3 _Stockholders Meeting; Record Date_. As soon as practicable
following the SEC Clearance Date, the Company shall establish a record date
for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at
the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "). Once the Company has
established the Record Date, the Company shall consult with Parent prior to
changing the Record Date or establishing a different record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting, unless required to do so by applicable Law. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable following the SEC Clearance Date (but
in no event later than thirty-five (35) calendar days following the SEC
Clearance Date), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Sections 5.4(d)_ and
5.4(e) hereof, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company
Board Recommendation. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request
of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to advise Parent during the last
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect
to the Company Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions (including the
Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters or such
matters as required by Law) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by
the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting (a) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders, (b) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such
meeting, or (c) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law, Order or a request from the
SEC or its staff; _provided_ , that no adjournment may be to a date on or
after two (2) Business Days prior to the Expiration Date.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Non-Solicitation_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Representatives to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing
with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and deliver a written notice to each such
Person to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such Person with respect to any Takeover Proposal and such
notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries. From the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ ,

 



38  the Company will not, and will not authorize or permit any Subsidiary or
Representative to (and shall instruct its Representatives not to), directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly facilitate or
encourage (including by providing consent or authorization to make a Takeover
Proposal to any officer or employee of the Company or to the Company Board (or
any member thereof) pursuant to any confidentiality agreement) any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding or provide any information or data concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any Takeover
Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Takeover Proposal; (iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill or confidentiality agreement, any rights agreement or "poison pill"
arrangement or Takeover Statute; (iv) approve, endorse, recommend, execute or
enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement; or (v) resolve, propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval the Company has received a written Takeover
Proposal from a Third Party which it believes in good faith to be _bona fide_
and that was not initiated or solicited in breach of this _Section 5.4_ and
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and the CompanyÂ’s independent financial advisor) that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company may: (i) furnish any information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , that, prior to taking any action described in  _Section
5.4(b)(i)_ or _5.4(b)(ii)_ , the Company shall enter into a confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less favorable to the Company than the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_
"), it being understood and hereby agreed that such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement need not contain a "standstill" or similar provision that prohibits
such Person(s) from making or consummating any Takeover Proposal, and the
Company shall provide to Parent a copy of all such information not previously
provided to Parent (or its Representatives) prior to, or at the same time as,
such information is provided to such Third Party. In making
such determination the Company Board shall take into consideration, among
other factors: (x) whether such Third Party is reasonably likely to have
adequate sources of financing or adequate funds to consummate such Takeover
Proposal and (y) whether approval of such Third PartyÂ’s stockholders is
required as a condition to its obligation to consummate such Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-public
information to any competitor in connection with the actions contemplated by
this _Section 5.4(b)_, except in a manner consistent with the CompanyÂ’s past
practice in dealing with the disclosure of such information in the context of
considering Takeover Proposals prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Company shall require any Person submitting an unsolicited Takeover Proposal
to provide a definitive agreement that marks any proposed changes to the terms
of this Agreement. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status of any Takeover Proposal.

 



39 (c) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 5.4(d)_ or _5.4(e)_ , none
of the Company Board, any committee thereof or Representative of the Company
shall (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the unanimous recommendation by the Company Board that
stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger (the
" _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (B) adopt, approve or recommend or
propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) a Takeover
Proposal, (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests, (D) fail to recommend
against any Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act
in a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Takeover
Proposal, or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any action described in this clause (i)(A)Â—(E) being referred to
as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause, permit or
authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any merger,
acquisition or similar agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a
material development or change in material circumstances occurring or arising
after the date hereof, the existence and material consequences of which were
not known by the Company Board at or prior to the date hereof (and not
relating to any Takeover Proposal, which shall be governed by clause (e) of
this _Section 5.4_) (such material development or change in circumstances, an
" _Intervening Event_ ") the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if it determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such action is
advisable in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event unless:

(i) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable after
becoming aware of it (and in any event within three (3) Business Days);

 

(ii) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days
before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifying the reasons
therefor; and

(iii) if Parent makes a proposal during such five (5) Business Day period to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change is necessary in order for the Company
Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



40 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company
Board receives a Takeover Proposal from a Third Party that is a binding,
written offer capable of acceptance that the Company Board determines
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or (y) enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Company shall have
concurrently with entering into such Company Acquisition Agreement terminated
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, in the case of each of
clauses (x) and (y), if and only if:

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such action is
necessary in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), which notice
shall specify the basis for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the
material terms thereof and include copies of the final forms of all relevant
documents relating to such Superior Proposal;

(iii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and ParentÂ’s
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company Board to determine that any such Takeover Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that in the event of any
material revisions to such Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.4(e)_ with respect to such material revisions (in such event,
however, the Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days);

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement offered by Parent and shall have determined that such Takeover
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were
to be given effect; and

 

(v) in the case of any action described in clause (y) of this _Section
5.4(e)_ above, the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, including the payment of the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3_.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



41 " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Third Party which the Company believes in good faith to be _bona fide_
relating to any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the
ordinary course of business) equal to 20% or more of the CompanyÂ’s
consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the CompanyÂ’s revenues on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of 20% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company, in each of clauses (A) - (D) above, other
than the Transactions.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Takeover Proposal which the Company
believes in good faith to be _bona fide_ to acquire, directly or indirectly
(whether by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, tender or exchange offer, asset sale or
otherwise), for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
80% of the equity securities of the Company or more than 80% of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a Third
Party, and which is otherwise on terms and conditions which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors) to be more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders than the
Merger and the other Transactions, after taking into consideration, among
other things, (i) the identity of the Third Party making the Takeover Proposal
(including whether stockholder approval of such Third Party is required),
(ii) the likelihood of shareholder litigation regarding the Takeover Proposal,
(iii) all of the terms, conditions, impact and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal and this Agreement,
including break-up fee and expense reimbursement provisions, and (iv) any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
5.4(e)_).

 

" _Third Party_ " means any Person, including as defined in Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act, other than Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M A promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if the Company Board
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so
disclose such position would reasonably be expected to constitute a violation
of applicable Law (including any fiduciary duties of the Company Board arising
thereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that that the Company and the Company
Board may not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, except to the
extent permitted by _Sections 5.4(d)_ or _5.4(e)_. In addition, it is
understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement (including 
_Article VII_), a factually accurate public statement by the Company that
describes the CompanyÂ’s receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act, or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company,
shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a proposal by
the Company Board to withdraw or modify such boardÂ’s recommendation of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 



42 (h) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48
hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Takeover
Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company or any of its representatives indicating, in connection with such
notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer or
proposal, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of
any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the CompanyÂ’s
intentions as previously notified.

(i) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Representatives takes any
action authorized or permitted by the Company which, if taken by the Company,
would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.4_, then the Company shall be
deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.4_.

(j) Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(a)_, the Company Board shall be
permitted to grant a waiver or release under any standstill agreement in
effect on the date hereof with respect to any class of equity securities of
the Company solely to the extent necessary to permit the Person subject to
such standstill agreement to make and engage in discussions with respect to
and negotiate a Takeover Proposal that is conditioned upon entering into
mutually satisfactory definitive documentation with the Company and which
prohibits without the CompanyÂ’s consent any open market purchases of equity
securities or securities convertible into equity securities of the Company,
any Takeover Proposal not approved by the Company Board or other action,
including a proxy contest, not approved by the Company Board. The Company
shall provide written notice to Parent within forty-eight (48) hours of the
waiver of any standstill by the Company and shall otherwise comply with
_Sections 5.4(d)_ and _5.4(e)_.

 

SECTION 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon
as practicable; and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state Takeover

relating to the exchange of information, each party hereto shall consult and
cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of
the other parties in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation,

connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
legal proceeding. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Authority or by Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other legal proceeding, each party hereto shall
permit authorized Representatives of the other parties (x) to be present at
each meeting or conference with a representative of a Governmental Authority
relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other legal
proceeding and (y) to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
legal proceeding.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.5_, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions.
Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the Company shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions, on or before the
Expiration Date, including by defending through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in any court by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the
consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and
in any event no later than the Expiration Date).

 



44 SECTION 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except as set
forth in _Section 5.4_, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the
extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with
respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law, applicable fiduciary
duties or by any applicable listing agreement with a national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market as determined in the good faith judgment
of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall
not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without (i) prior consultation with the other party and (ii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such other partyÂ’s prior
consent); _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to _Section 5.4_, the Company
need not consult with Parent or Merger Sub in connection with any press
release or public statement to be issued or made in connection with any
Takeover Proposal or any Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and _provided_
, _further_ , that each of Parent and the Company may make any public
statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls,
so long as such statement is substantially similar to previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the
Company (or individually, if approved by the other party).

SECTION 5.7  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and ParentÂ’s
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ properties, books, Contracts and records and
the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) such other information concerning
its business and properties as Parent may reasonably request ( _provided_ ,
that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company). The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish, to the extent currently prepared by the Company in the
ordinary course of business, for the period beginning after the date of this
Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, as soon as practicable after the
end of each month during such period, a copy of the monthly internally
prepared financial statements of the Company, including statements of
financial condition, results of operations and statements of cash flow.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information pursuant to this  _Section 5.7_ if (x) the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third
party, jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, expose the
Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information or result in the disclosure of any trade secrets, _provided_ ,
that the parties shall cooperate in good faith in seeking to find a means
of disclosure of such information (including by entering into a joint-defense
or similar agreement, if appropriate) that would not result in such violation,

 



45  jeopardy or exposure, or (y) such information relates to or includes the
evaluation, deliberations or minutes of the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) related to the Transactions or any other strategic alternatives
involving the Company or any materials provided to the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) in connection therewith. Until the Effective Time, any
information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ will be deemed "
_Business Information_ " (as such term is defined by the Confidentiality
Agreement) subject to the terms of that certain letter agreement regarding,
among other things, the confidentiality of certain information provided to
Parent in connection with its evaluation of the Transactions, dated as of
November 18, 2011, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions. No investigation, or information
received, pursuant to this _Section 5.7_, will modify any of the
representations and warranties of the Company.

SECTION 5.8  _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, and (iii)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that would cause or result in
any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ not being
satisfied.

SECTION 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) assume all obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities (and advancement of expenses) for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in: (i) the
Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (ii) the indemnification agreements
listed on _Section 5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall
survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Effective Time until all applicable statutes of
limitations have expired, shall cause the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable
to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers, indemnification and advancement of expenses than are set forth as of
the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.

 



46 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase, and, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain with reputable
and financially sound carriers, fully pre-paid six-year "tail" policies to the
current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciaries liability
insurance policies maintained as of the date hereof by the Company (the "
_Current Policies_ "), which tail policies shall cover a period from the
Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Closing Date
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred
prior to or at the Effective Time, and which tail policies shall contain at
least the same coverage (including the scope and amount thereof) as, and
contain terms and conditions that are equivalent to, the coverage set forth
in the Current Policies; _provided_ , that the aggregate cost of such "tail"
policies (for the entire six-year tail coverage period) shall not exceed more
than 300% of the aggregate premium paid by the Company for the Current
Policies for the current fiscal year; _provided_ , _further_ , that should the
cost of such "tail" policies exceed the 300% cap, the Company shall instead
purchase the best available coverage for 300% of the aggregate premium paid
by the Company for the Current Policies for the current fiscal year.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her Representatives, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this _Section 5.9_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_). Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to,
or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Company shall share equally in
the filing fee under the HSR Act.

 



47 SECTION 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 5.12 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent shall, for a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date,
cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to provide employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed during such period (the "
_Company Employees_ ") with (x) base salary that, on an individual-by-
individual basis, is no less favorable to the base salaries in effect on the
date hereof and (y) employee benefits (other than any equity-based benefits)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee
benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Company Employees on
the date hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide,
Company Employees whose employment terminates during the one-year period
following the Effective Time with severance pay (and other separation
benefits) as set forth on _Section 5.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
taking into account all such employeeÂ’s service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries in determining the amount of severance benefits payable to such
employee.

(c) Parent and its Affiliates shall recognize the service of Company Employees
with the Company prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with any tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan and any
severance, vacation and holiday policies maintained by Parent or one of its
Affiliates which is made available to Company Employees following the Closing
Date by Parent or one of its Affiliates for purposes of vesting, eligibility
to participate and calculation of severance and vacation benefits, except to
the extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. Parent shall (i) waive, or use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations
as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under
any health benefit plan which is made available to Company Employees by Parent
or one of its Affiliates in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to
the extent such limitations or conditions are waived or satisfied under a
comparable Company Plan as of the Closing Date, and (ii) in the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs, provide credit to Company Employees for any co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under
the health benefit plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the portion
of the plan year including the Closing Date.

(d) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that, (i) neither this _Section
5.12_ nor any other provision of this Agreement shall create any right in any
Person (including any Company Employee) to employment or continued employment
or any particular term or condition of employment with Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates or preclude
the ability of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee (including
any Company Employee) at any time and for any or no reason, (ii) Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates shall not
be required to

 



48  establish or continue any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract or arrangement and neither this _Section 5.12_ nor any other
provision of this Agreement shall prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Closing, and (iii) any Company Employee or any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement shall not have any rights or
remedies (including any third-party beneficiary rights) under or by reason of
this _Section 5.12_.

SECTION 5.13 _Delisting_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to enable the Surviving Corporation
to de-list the CompanyÂ’s securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market and de-
register the CompanyÂ’s securities under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.14 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partyÂ’s
rights or obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
_Section 5.1_), the parties understand and agree that: (i) nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its operations.

SECTION 5.15  _Litigation_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking
damages or other relief as a result of, the Merger, this Agreement or the
other Transactions, including seeking to have any Order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions entered by any court
or other Governmental Authority promptly vacated or reversed.

SECTION 5.16 _Parent Vote_. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228
of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a
written consent adopting the Agreement.

SECTION 5.17 _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments, and shall not permit any amendment or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing
Commitments if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing unless the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount), or (ii) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions,
to the receipt of the Financing, in any such case of (i) or (ii) above, in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing,
(B) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or (C) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub or, with respect to the Equity Financing, the
Company to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or the likelihood of
consummation of the Transactions.

 



49 (b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.17(a)_ to the contrary, Parent
and Merger Sub may (i) amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) otherwise
amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letter so long as: (x) such action would
not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, (y) the terms are
not, taken as a whole, materially less beneficial to Parent or the Company
than those in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and (z) with respect to replacements, the replacement debt
commitments otherwise satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternative
Financing Commitment set forth below. Notwithstanding anything in _Section
5.17(a)_ to the contrary, Parent may enter into discussions regarding, and may
enter into arrangements and agreements relating to, the Equity Financing to
add other equity providers, on the condition that such arrangements or
agreements: (i) do not reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing,
(ii) do not impose terms or conditions that would reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the Closing, and (iii) with respect to any such equity
provider, such equity provider enters into an Equity Commitment Letter on
substantially the same terms and conditions as the Equity Commitment Letters
then in effect.

 

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect
the Financing Commitments (including any definitive agreements entered into
in connection with any such Financing Commitments), (ii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or consistent in all
material respects with the Debt Commitment Letter (such definitive agreements,
together with the Financing Commitments, the " _Financing Agreements_ ") and
promptly upon execution thereof provide complete executed copies of such
definitive agreements to the Company, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions in the Financing Agreements applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to
obtaining the Financing, (iv) consummate the Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing substantially concurrently with the Closing, and (v) fully enforce
the counterpartiesÂ’ obligations and its rights under the Financing Agreements.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the
status of ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s efforts to arrange the Financing and to
satisfy the conditions thereof, including, upon CompanyÂ’s reasonable request,
(i) advising and updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with
respect to status, proposed Closing Date and material terms of the material
definitive documentation for the Financing and (ii) providing copies of then
current drafts of all such definitive documentation.

 

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the applicable Financing Agreements, (i) Parent
shall promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and
conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company than the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Financing Agreements (" _Alternative Financing Commitments_ ") as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. In such event, (i) the
term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement

 



50  shall be deemed to include any Alternative Financing Commitments, (ii) the
term "Financing" shall be deemed to include the Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing as modified by clause (i) of this sentence, (ii) the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letters with
respect to the Alternative Financing Commitments and any related fee letters,
and (iv) the term "Financing Agreements" shall be deemed to include any
definitive agreement with respect to the Alternative Financing Commitments.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 5.17_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or of the
Financing Agreements.

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Financing (including
any Alternative Financing Commitments) is not a condition to the Closing, and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing, subject to the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_.

SECTION 5.18 _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall (x) cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and
(y) use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, use its
and their reasonable best efforts to, provide all cooperation that is
customary in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be
reasonably requested in writing by Parent ( _provided_ , that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), including: (i) participation in a reasonable
number of meetings, due diligence sessions, lender presentations, "road
shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation
of materials for rating agency presentations, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda and similar documents required in connection with
the Debt Financing, (iii) furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing sources
with such pertinent and customary information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including information required under "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, all financial statements and
projections and other pertinent information required by the Debt Financing
Commitment, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit reports

such information in this clause (iii), the " _Required Information_ "), (iv)

requested in writing by Parent, (v) obtaining such consents, approvals and
authorizations which shall be reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the Debt Financing and collateral arrangements in connection therewith,
(vi) executing and delivering any customary pledge and security documents,
other definitive financing documents or other requested certificates or
documents, including, including, a customary solvency certificate by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company ( _provided_ , that (A) none of the letters,
agreements, documents and certificates shall be executed and delivered except
in connection with the Closing, (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be
conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence of the Closing
and (C) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its Representatives
shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any liability in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time and (D) such
documents or

 



51  certificates shall not impose any personal liability on the officers,
directors, employees or agents involved), and (vii) obtaining any assignments
of Intellectual Property set forth in  _Section 5.18(a)(vii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and making all necessary filings with governmental
registration agencies to update ownership title in the Company Intellectual
Property in the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and to record the release
of any security interests granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
the Company Intellectual Property that have been released.

(b) Parent shall promptly, upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred and documented by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 5.18_ and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with
respect to any information provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.19 _FIRPTA_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver to Parent at or prior to the closing an affidavit, under penalties
of perjury, stating that the Company is not and has not been a United States

reasonably acceptable to Parent.

reasonable efforts to update the registration information for the Internet
domain name registrations required to be set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule that are material to the operation of the
CompanyÂ’s business to reflect the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as the
registrant of such Internet domain names (to the extent the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries is not the registrant of such Internet domain names as of the
date hereof).

of Parent and Merger Sub by an executive officer of Parent and Merger Sub to
such effect; and

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger
Sub shall have performed or complied in all material respects with all of the
obligations required to be performed or complied with by them under this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of
Parent and Merger Sub to such effect.

SECTION 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
6.1_, _6.2_ or _6.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure
was caused by such partyÂ’s failure to use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, as required by and subject
to _Section 5.5_.

 



54 ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

SECTION 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

Company Stockholder Approval:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective boards of directors; or 

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before one hundred and
twenty (120) days from the date hereof (the " _Expiration Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the date that is thirty-five (35)

" _Earliest Closing Date_ ") would occur after the Expiration Date, the
Expiration Date shall be extended to the earlier of the next calendar day
following the Earliest Closing Date and the date that is one hundred and fifty
(150) days from the date hereof; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on
or before the Expiration Date was primarily due to the failure of such party
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final,
non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate

(c) by Parent,

(i) if the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ and (y) has
not been waived by Parent or cured by the Company within ten (10) days after
the CompanyÂ’s receipt 

 



55  of written notice thereof from Parent or is incapable of being cured by the
Company by the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or

 

(ii) if (A) there shall have been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
_provided_ , that any termination pursuant to this Clause (A) must be made
within five (5) Business Days of any such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, (B) the Company shall have committed a Willful Breach of any of its

the Company Board shall have refused to affirm publicly is recommendation of
this Agreement within three (3) Business Days after any written request
therefore by Parent; or 

(d) by the Company:

(i) if Parent shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_ and (ii)
has not been waived by the Company or cured by Parent within ten (10) days
after ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice thereof from the Company or is
incapable of being cured by Parent by the Expiration Date, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any termination by the Company pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(d)(i)_ shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if the Company
is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement;

(ii) at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in
order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal (so long as such
Superior Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a breach of
_Section 5.4_); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.2(d)(ii)_ unless (A) the
Company Board shall have complied with the procedures set forth in _Section
5.4(e)_, (B) the Company enters into a definitive Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal concurrently with such
termination, and (C) and the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee
concurrently with such termination; or

 

(iii) if: (A) the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that (x) by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and that would be capable of
being satisfied if there were a Closing, or (y) have not been satisfied as a
result of Parent or Merger SubÂ’s breach or failure to perform any of their
respective covenants in this Agreement), and (B) Parent fails to close the
Transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger, within two (2)
Business Days thereof.

 



56 SECTION 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than _Sections 5.9_, _5.10_ , _5.18(b)_ , _7.2_ , _7.3_
, _7.4_ , _7.5_ , _Article VIII_ and the second to last sentence of _Section
5.7_, and the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms, all of
which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
directors, officers and Affiliates, except that:

 

(a) the Company may have liability as provided in _Section 7.3_;

 

(b) Parent may have liability as provided in _Section 7.4_; and

 

(c) nothing in this _Section 7.2_ shall relieve any party hereto from any
liability for Fraud.

 

SECTION 7.3 _Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement_.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_, _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, _Section 7.1(c)(i)_, _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ or  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall promptly, and
in any event within two (2) Business Days (in the case of a termination by
Parent) or immediately upon such termination of this Agreement (in the case of
a termination by the Company), pay or cause to be paid to Parent (or, at
SponsorÂ’s election, Sponsor), by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the Company Termination Fee (less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously
paid to Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.3(b)_, if any); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of a termination solely pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_, _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(i)_: (A) such payment
shall be made only if the Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement
with a Third Party within twelve (12) months following such termination, and
(B) such payment shall be made promptly, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days, after the entering into of such Company Acquisition Agreement.
ParentÂ’s acceptance of the Company Termination Fee shall constitute conclusive
evidence that this Agreement has been validly terminated.

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_
under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not then payable
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, then the Company shall, following receipt of an
invoice therefor, promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay
up to $2,000,000 of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on
or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the
Transactions (including the Financing) (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by wire
transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the existence of circumstances which could
require the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_ shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)_ except to the extent indicated in  _Section 7.3(a)_.

 



57 SECTION 7.4 _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ or _Section
7.1(d)(iii)_, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee
to the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days
following such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Company.

SECTION 7.5 _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_.

(a) Subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ and ParentÂ’s right to specific performance
set forth in _Section 8.8(a)(i)_, (i) ParentÂ’s right to receive the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ shall constitute the exclusive
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates and assignees (the Company, its Subsidiaries and
such other Persons being referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and (ii) upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the maximum liability of the Company and the
Company Related Parties under this Agreement shall be limited to the amount of
the Company Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 7.5(a)_ shall limit in anyway the partiesÂ’ agreements in _Section
8.12_.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay,
or cause to be paid, the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Company be obligated to pay, or
cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) Subject to the CompanyÂ’s right to specific performance set forth in
_Section 8.8(b)_ and the CompanyÂ’s rights under the Limited Guaranty, the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Sections 5.18(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , the CompanyÂ’s
right to receive the Parent Termination Fee from Parent or from the Guarantor
pursuant to the Limited Guarantee pursuant to _Section 7.4_ shall constitute
the exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent and the Parent Group for
any damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated, and, upon payment of such amount, none of Parent or any member of
the Parent Group shall have any further liability to the Company arising out
of this Agreement or the Transactions. In the event the Company has received
all amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to this _Section 7.5(c)_, none
of Parent, Parent Group or the Lender Parties shall have any further liability
under this Agreement or the other Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 7.5(c)_ shall limit in anyway the partiesÂ’
agreements in _Section 8.12_.

may be, except that the agreements set forth in _Article II_ and _Sections

written agreement of the parties hereto authorized by action taken by their

Transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant
to the express terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the parties hereto
expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or entitled to any remedies
not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each
hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations
of sophisticated parties derived from armÂ’s-length negotiations, and all

special relationship with another party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary purchaser and an ordinary seller in an

confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder, except for

7.5(c)_, _Section 8.6_,  _Section 8.7(b)_ and _Section 8.7(c)_ and shall
be entitled to enforce such provisions directly (and no amendment or
modification to such provisions or to _Section 8.12_ in respect of the Lender

(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, the Related Documents or the negotiation, execution,
termination, validity, interpretation, construction, enforcement, performance
or nonperformance of this Agreement or the Related Documents or otherwise
arising from the relationship between the parties (including, without
limitation, any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or the Related Documents or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement

 



60  or the Related Documents) (all such claims or causes of action, a " _Cause
of Action_ ") shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware
(including its laws regarding statutes of limitations), without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rules (whether of the State of
Delaware or otherwise) that would cause the application of Laws of any other
jurisdiction.

 

(b) All actions and proceedings that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to a Cause of Action shall be exclusively heard and determined in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the case of appeals,
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such Cause of Action brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient
forum for the maintenance of such dispute. The consents to jurisdiction set
forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of
process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any claim, action,
suit or proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Lender Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof), and that the provisions of _Section 8.7(c)_ relating to the waiver
of jury trial shall apply to any such action; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not limit in any way the partiesÂ’ agreements in _Section
8.12_.

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights
to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to a Cause
of Action.

SECTION 8.8 _Remedies_.

pursuant to _Article VII_ , Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek
and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, including the CompanyÂ’s obligation to
consummate the Merger.

(ii) _Company Termination Fee_. Parent shall be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee if and when payable under _Section 7.3(a)_ hereof.

 



61 (iii) _Parent Expenses_. Parent shall be entitled to reimbursement of Parent
Expenses if and when payable under _Section 7.3(b)_ hereof.

(iv) _Termination_. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to terminate this

officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons, assignees or
Affiliates of any of the foregoing have the right to seek or obtain money
damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) from the Company under this Agreement other than the right
of Parent and Merger Sub to payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent
Expenses as set forth in _Sections 8.8(a)(ii)_ and _(a)(iii)_ above. For the
avoidance of doubt, so long as this Agreement remains in effect, Parent and
Merger Sub shall be entitled to settle such claims, at Parent and Merger
SubÂ’s election, by agreeing to consummate and actually consummating the Merger
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Remedies of the Company_.

(i) _Specific Performance  Â– Closing_. Prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof, the Company shall be entitled to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to cause, or to require Parent to cause, the Equity Commitment Letter to be
funded and to consummate the Merger, only in the event that each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that (x) by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing
and that would be capable of being satisfied if there were a Closing, or (y)
have not been satisfied as a result of Parent or Merger SubÂ’s breach or
failure to perform any of their respective covenants in this Agreement) and
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to  _Section 1.2_, (B) the Debt Financing
(or, if an Alternative Financing Commitment is being used in accordance with
this Agreement, such alternative financing) has been funded or will be funded
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (C) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent and
the Lenders that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically the ParentÂ’s right to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded
(or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the specific
circumstances and as specifically set forth in this _Section 8.8(b)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, while the

 



62  Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and the payment of
the Parent Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company be
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee.

(ii) _Specific Performance Â– Other Covenants_. Prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and other than as it relates to
the right to cause Parent to cause the Equity Commitment Letter to be funded
and to consummate the Merger (which are governed by the provisions of

injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including to cause Parent to
seek enforcement of the Financing Agreements pursuant to _Section 5.17(c)_.

the Parent Termination Fee if and when payable under _Section 7.4_ hereof.

(iv) _Termination_. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Article VII_ hereof.

(v) _Damages; Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.5(c)_, in no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
equityholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons,
assignees or Affiliates of any of the foregoing have the right to seek or
obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) from Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement
other than as set forth in _Section 5.18(b)_ and other than the right of the
Company to payment of the Parent Termination Fee as set forth in _Section
8.8(b)(iii)_ above.

 

(c) _Money Damages Not Adequate_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement to
which the right of specific performance is applicable were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any
breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases
by monetary damages alone. Solely to the extent specific performance is
available to it under this _Section 8.8_, it is accordingly agreed that prior
to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, each party shall not raise any objections to the equitable remedies
provided by this  _Section 8.8_. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction sought
in accordance with the terms of this _Section 8.8_.

provided for in this _Section 8.8_ shall be the partiesÂ’ sole and exclusive
remedies for any breaches this Agreement or any claims relating to the
Transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
other rights, claims and causes of action, known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that such party may have
against the other party or any of its Representatives arising under or based
upon any federal, state or local Law (including any securities law, common law
or otherwise) for any breach of the representations and warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement.
