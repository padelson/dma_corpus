ARTICLE 2

  

The Offer

  

  

Section 2.01. The Offer. (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
but in no event later than ten Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer. The Offer
shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (the "Offer
Conditions"). The date on which Merger Subsidiary commences the Offer is
referred to as the "Offer Commencement Date".

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to the
satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Merger Subsidiary shall, and
Parent shall cause it to, promptly after the Expiration Date, accept for
payment all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer (the time at which Shares are first accepted for payment pursuant to and
subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer, the "Acceptance Time"). The
obligation of Merger Subsidiary to accept for payment and pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to: (i) the number of Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not
validly withdrawn prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date representing,
together with the Contributed Shares and the Shares beneficially owned by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary (if any), at least 67.2% of the Shares outstanding
on a fully-diluted basis as of the Expiration Date (the "Minimum Tender
Condition"); (ii) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated (the "HSR Act Condition") and (iii) the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary of each of the other Offer Conditions. Promptly (within the meaning
of Section 14e-1(c) under the 1934 Act) after the Acceptance Time, Merger
Subsidiary shall pay the Offer Price for such Shares. The date of acceptance
for payment of Shares pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing," and the date on which
the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Closing Date." The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to
the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary expressly reserve the right to waive any of
the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to
the Offer (including raising the Offer Price); provided that, without the
prior written consent of the Company or unless otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall:

  

  

(i) waive or change the Minimum Tender Condition;

  

  

(ii) decrease the Offer Price;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

  

  

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

  

  

(v) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer except as
otherwise provided herein; or

  

  

(vi) impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner
materially adverse to the holders of the Shares.

  

  

(d) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire on the date that is 20
business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-l(g)(3) under the 1934 Act)
after the Offer Commencement Date (the "Initial Expiration Date"). The date on
which the Offer finally expires (taking into account any extensions that may
be elected or required pursuant to and in accordance with this Section
2.01(d)) is referred to herein as the "Expiration Date." Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (including the
Initial Expiration Date), (i) Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause
it to, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer or for
any period otherwise required by Applicable Law; (ii) Merger Subsidiary may,
and, if requested by the Company, shall, extend the Offer for one or more
periods if any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived;
provided, however, that Merger Subsidiary shall not have the right to extend
the Offer pursuant to this clause (ii) (A) beyond the earlier of (x) December
5, 2012 and (y) the date that is five Business Days following the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date, or (B) if such extension is prohibited by any
Applicable Law or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or Nasdaq; and (iii) Merger Subsidiary may extend the Offer if, at the date
upon which the Offer is scheduled to expire, all of the Offer Conditions have
been satisfied or waived and the Initial Marketing Period has not ended as of
the last Business Day prior to such scheduled expiration date until the
earliest to occur of (1) the first Business Day after the Debt Providers have
waived the condition in the Debt Commitment Letter relating to the Initial
Marketing Period and (2) the first Business Day after the final day of the
Initial Marketing Period. The Offer may be terminated prior to the Expiration
Date if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 11.

  

  

(e) If (i) at any then-scheduled Expiration Date (including the Initial
Expiration Date), any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived
and no further extensions or re-extensions are required or permitted pursuant
to Section 2.01(d) or (ii) five Business Days have elapsed since the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date, then Merger Subsidiary may irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. If (A) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article 11 or (B) there shall exist a Top-Up Impediment and Merger
Subsidiary elects to terminate the Offer, then, in each case, Merger
Subsidiary shall promptly irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer.
The parties hereto

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

  

 

  

acknowledge and agree that the termination of the Offer shall not give rise to
a right of termination of this Agreement except as expressly provided for
herein and that, absent any such termination of this Agreement, the
obligations of the parties hereunder other than those related to the Offer
shall continue to remain in effect, including those obligations with respect
to the Merger.

  

  

(f) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall include
the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement
(collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer
Documents") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders
of Shares to the extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act).
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the Offer Documents to (A) comply
with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and (B) not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, no covenant, representation or warranty is made
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary with respect to information supplied by the
Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall cause the information supplied by Parent and its Affiliates specifically
for inclusion in the Company's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9"), at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC, not
to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become (or
shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by
Applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any Offer Document each time before any
such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
give due consideration to any reasonable comments made by the Company and its
counsel. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide the Company and its
counsel with (1) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to any of the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (2) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to
which due

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

  

 

  

consideration shall be given to reasonable comments), including by
participating with Parent and Merger Subsidiary or their counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

  

  

Section 2.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and
represents that the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of
Directors"), at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and the Company's stockholders; (ii) approved, adopted and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of Delaware Law;
(iii) resolved, subject to Section 7.03(b), to recommend that the Company's
stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Subsidiary in the
Offer, and, to the extent applicable, adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger; and (iv) elected that the Offer and the Merger not be subject to any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination," "fair
price" or other form of anti-takeover laws of any jurisdiction that may
purport to be applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated herein. The Company has been advised that all of its directors
and executive officers who own Shares intend to tender their Shares pursuant
to the Offer. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case
true and correct as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to
Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer or the Merger.

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall
file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by Applicable Law, the Schedule 14D-9 that, subject to
Section 7.03(b), shall reflect the recommendations of the Board of Directors
referred to above. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in
its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in
accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act (regardless
of whether such item is applicable). The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (i) comply with
the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and (ii) not (A) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or (B) omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to
information supplied by Parent or Merger Subsidiary specifically for inclusion
in the Schedule 14D-9

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(including any such information included in the Company Proxy Statement). The
Company shall cause the information supplied by it specifically for inclusion
in the Offer Documents, at the respective times the Offer Documents are filed
with the SEC, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
agrees promptly to correct any information supplied by it specifically for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become
(or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by Applicable Law.
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is
filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their
counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel
with (1) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that
the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications, and (2) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the Company's response to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which due consideration shall be given to
reasonable comments), including by participating with the Company or its
counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. The Company shall respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments to the SEC with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9.

  

  

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable furnish to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary all information concerning the Company that may be required by
Applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Subsidiary
specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents.

  

  

Section 2.03. Directors. (a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this Section); and (ii) the percentage
that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger
Subsidiary (including Shares accepted for payment), together with the
Contributed Shares, bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the
Company promptly shall cause Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to
the Board of Directors, including by increasing the number of directors, and
seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors or amending the
Company's bylaws as is necessary to give effect to the foregoing provision;
provided that until the Effective Time, at least two Independent Directors
shall remain on the Board of Directors. At such time, the Company shall also
cause individuals designated by

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole
number, on (A) each committee of the Board of Directors and (B) as requested
by Parent, each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each
committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals
represented on the Board of Directors. Except as provided in the first and
second sentences of this Section 2.03(a), the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all of the members of the Board of Directors and
such committees and boards as of the date hereof who are not employees of the
Company remain members of the Board of Directors and such committees and
boards.

  

  

(b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Board of
Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder require in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act
and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent
(the "Independent Directors") shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors and
no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of
this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring
action by the Board of Directors, any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, and any waiver
of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for
the benefit of the Company.

  

  

Section 2.04. Top-Up Option. (a) Subject to Section 2.04(b) and Section
2.04(c), the Company grants to Merger Subsidiary an irrevocable option, for so
long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions
hereof (the "Top-Up Option"), to purchase from the Company up to the number of
Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares
owned by Merger Subsidiary at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
together with the Contributed Shares, constitutes at least 90% of the Shares
outstanding on the Offer Closing Date, on a fully-diluted basis (such Shares
to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the "Top-Up Shares");
provided that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the extent (i) the
number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the
number of authorized but unissued and unreserved Shares plus the number of
Shares held as treasury shares or (ii) any provision of Applicable Law would
prohibit the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares with
respect to such exercise.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 9.01(a), the Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger
Subsidiary in whole or in part, only once, at any time during the 10 Business
Day period following the Acceptance Time, and only if Merger Subsidiary shall
own, together with the Contributed Shares, as of such time less than 90% of
the Shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. The aggregate purchase price
payable for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to
the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up
Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid
by Merger Subsidiary, at its election, either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) by
paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of
such Top-Up Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory
note having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price.
Any such promissory note (A) shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum,
(B) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and
delivery of such promissory note, (C) may be prepaid without premium or
penalty, (D) shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, and (E)
shall have no other material terms. The Company shall include in the Schedule
14D-9 a description of the material terms of the Top-Up Option, including the
terms of any such promissory note.

  

  

(c) In the event Merger Subsidiary exercises the Top-Up Option, Merger
Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company a notice (the "Top-Up Notice") setting
forth (i) that Merger Subsidiary is exercising the Top-Up Option; (ii) the
manner in which Merger Subsidiary intends to pay the applicable purchase
price; and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of
such Top-Up Shares by Merger Subsidiary (the "Top-Up Closing") is to take
place. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, deliver written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary specifying the
number of Shares then outstanding and, based on such number and based on the
information provided by Merger Subsidiary in the Top-Up Notice, the number of
Top-Up Shares to be purchased. The Company shall make available to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary all information reasonably requested to enable Parent and
Merger Subsidiary to independently verify and calculate the number of Shares
necessary for Merger Subsidiary to be merged into the Company without a vote
or consent of the Company's stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of
Delaware Law. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary that, as promptly as practicable following such
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary intends to (and Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, as promptly as
practicable after such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with
Section 253 of Delaware Law as contemplated by Section 9.01(e). At the Top-Up
Closing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Subsidiary a
certificate representing the Top-

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Up Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Top-Up Closing to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is
deemed received by the Company pursuant to Section 12.01, and if not so
consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties
further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be
consummated in accordance with Section 253 of Delaware Law as contemplated by
Section 9.01(e) as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent
possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

  

  

(d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option
is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger Subsidiary for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with
any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 1933 Act. Any certificates
evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by applicable
securities laws.

  

  

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any dilutive impact on
the value of the Shares as a result of the Top-Up Option, the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares or the payment by Merger Subsidiary to the Company of any
consideration for the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any dissenting Shares in any appraisal
proceeding pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law as contemplated by Section
3.04.

  

  

ARTICLE 3

  

The Merger

  

  

Section 3.01. The Merger. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the
"Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place (i) if the Offer Closing shall not have occurred
prior to the Closing, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two
Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions
(such date being the "First Eligible One-Step Closing Date"), or (ii) if the
Offer Closing shall have occurred on or prior to the Closing, on the date of,
and immediately following the later to occur

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

  

 

  

of (A) the Offer Closing and (B) the Top-Up Closing (if applicable), in each
case at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York, 10017, or at such other place, at such other time or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may agree. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, if the Offer Closing shall not have occurred prior to the Closing,
at the option of Parent the Closing may take place on either (x) a Business
Day on or after the First Eligible One-Step Closing Date during the One-Step
Marketing Period to be specified by Parent on no less than three Business
Days' notice to the Company or (y) the Business Day after the final day of the
One-Step Marketing Period.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later
time as may be agreed upon by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company and
specified in such certificate of merger).

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the properties, rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject
to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, in each case as provided under Delaware Law.

  

  

Section 3.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any
holder of securities thereof:

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b), Section 3.02(c) or
Section 3.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than Shares in an
Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary
(including the Contributed Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 3.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated
Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not
later than five Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Paying Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

  

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon)
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment only as general creditors thereof of the Merger Consideration in
respect

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

  

 

  

of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares twenty-four months after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent,
free and clear of any claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  

  

Section 3.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
(a) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
(b) has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance, and in compliance in
all respects, with Section 262 of Delaware Law shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with,
and to the extent provided by, Section 262 of Delaware Law, unless such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value thereof shall cease and such Shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  

  

Section 3.05. Company Stock Options. (a) At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each option to acquire Shares granted or issued pursuant to
any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the "Company Stock Options"), whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall be canceled, and, at or promptly after the Effective Time,
the Company shall pay each holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option
an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such cancelled
Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have
purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had such holder exercised
such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain consents from holders of Company Stock Options and (ii) make
any amendments to the terms of any Company Stock Plans or Company Stock
Options that, in the case of either clauses (i) or (ii), are necessary to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 3.05(a); provided that the
Company shall not pay any amounts (other than any payments pursuant to Section

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

  

 

  

3.05(a)) for such consents without the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding any provision of Section 3.05, payment may be withheld in
respect of any Company Stock Option until any such consent is obtained with
respect to such Company Stock Option.

  

  

Section 3.06. Company RSUs. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary, if any, to provide that, at or immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each restricted Share unit granted or issued pursuant
to any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Company RSUs") shall be fully vested and
converted automatically into the right to receive from the Company at or
promptly after the Effective Time solely an amount in cash equal to the
product of (a) the Merger Consideration and (b) the total number of Shares
subject to such Company RSU.

  

  

Section 3.07. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, and without prejudice to Section 7.01, the
outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be adjusted appropriately.

  

  

Section 3.08. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to Article 2 and Article 3 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Applicable Law. If the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  

  

Section 3.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 3.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE 4

  

The Surviving Corporation

  

  

Section 4.01. Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated as
set forth in Exhibit A and shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 4.02. Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 4.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
Applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of
Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

warrants to Parent as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time that:

  

  

Section 5.01. Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all Consents required to
carry on its business as now conducted, except for such corporate powers and
Consents the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a

Company Securities. The Company is not a party to any voting agreement with
respect to the voting of any Company Securities. There have been no re-
pricings of any Company Stock Options through amendments, cancellation and
reissuance or other means during the current or prior two calendar years. None
of the Company Stock Options were granted with an exercise price below the

internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal

arrangements (whether or not written) binding the Company that provide for the
allocation, apportionment, sharing or assignment of any Tax liability or
benefit, or the transfer or assignment of income, revenues, receipts, or gains
for the purpose of determining any Person's Tax liability.

  

  

Section 5.17. Employees, Labor and Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section 5.17(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list
identifying each material Employee Plan. "Employee Plans" means each "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and whether or not subject
to ERISA, each employment, consulting, severance, change in control,
transaction bonus retention or similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy
and each other plan, agreement or arrangement (written or oral) providing for
compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related
rights (including the Company Stock Plans) or other forms of incentive or
deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance (including any self-
insured arrangements), health or medical benefits, employee assistance
program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers' compensation,
supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and post-employment or
retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life
insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered or contributed to by the
Company and covers any employee, individual independent contractor or former
employee or individual independent contractor of the Company, or with respect
to which the Company has or may have any material actual or contingent
liability. Copies of such plans, agreements, arrangements, and policies (and,
if applicable, related trusts, summary plan descriptions or funding agreements
and insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations
thereof have been made available to Parent, together with the most recent
annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and Tax
Return (Form 990) prepared in connection with any such plan or trust, funding
agreement or insurance policy.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessors thereof
sponsors, maintains, contributes to or is required to contribute to, and in
the past six years has not sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been
required to contribute to, any Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate contributes to or has in the
past six years contributed to any multiple employer plan (as described in
Section 413(c) of the Code) or multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA.

  

  

(d) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending or
has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company has no knowledge of any
reason why any such determination letter should be revoked or not issued or
such tax-qualified status would be lost. The Company has made available to
Parent copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Employee Plan has been maintained in
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, Orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which
are applicable to such Employee Plan; (ii) no event has occurred with respect
to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or against
the Company of any excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979,
4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code; and (iii) there has been no breach of
any fiduciary duty with respect to any Employee Plan or funding arrangement.

  

  

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company to any
payment of money or other property, including any bonus or severance,
retirement, job security or other material payment or benefit or accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or trigger any material payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
materially increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any current or former employee,
director or individual independent contractor of the Company that,
individually or collectively, could, as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code or
that would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. No
Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under
Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

  

  

(f) The Company does not have any material liability in respect of post-
retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or
current employees or individual independent contractors of the Company except
as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

  

  

(g) There has been no amendment to, interpretation or announcement (whether or
not written) by the Company relating to, or change in employee

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

  

 

  

participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of
the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2011.

  

  

(h) The Company is not a party to or subject to, or is currently negotiating
in connection with entering into, any collective bargaining agreement or other
Contract with a labor union or organization. The Company has not engaged in
any unfair labor practices, and there is no unfair labor practice complaint,
or union organizing effort, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company. There are no strikes, slowdowns or work
stoppages, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company. There are no other employment-related claims, including wrongful
termination, discrimination and sexual harassment claims, pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company is in compliance with all Applicable Laws relating to employment and
employment practices, including those relating to terms and conditions of
employment, wages and hours, collective bargaining, unemployment compensation,
equal employment opportunity, employment discrimination, workers'
compensation, employee classification, information privacy and security and
immigration.

  

  

(i) All material contributions and payments due or accrued under each Employee
Plan, determined in accordance with Applicable Law and GAAP and prior funding
and accrual practices, as adjusted to include proportional accruals for the
period ending as of the date hereof, have been timely and fully discharged and
paid on or prior to the date hereof except to the extent not yet due and then
reflected as a liability on the Company Balance Sheet.

  

  

(j) There is no Proceeding pending against or involving or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan.

  

  

(k) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Employee Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation § 1.409A-1(a)(l)(a) and subject to Section 409A of the Code (a
"Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan") was administered in material
compliance with Section 409A of the Code between January 1, 2005 and December
31, 2008, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A
of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder, and each Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan has been maintained and operated in material compliance with
Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2009.

  

  

Section 5.18. Environmental Matters. (a) Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Adverse Effect: (i) no notice, notification, demand, request for information,
citation, summons or Order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no

otherwise arising under or relating to any Environmental Law or any Hazardous
Substance.

  

  

(b) The Company has provided or made available to Parent complete and accurate
copies of all material reports and other documentation addressing

performed to which the Company is a party as of the date hereof pursuant to
which the Company is reasonably expected to spend or receive, in the

in any material respect, and the respective commitments contained therein have
not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any material respect.
As of the date hereof, (i) no event has occurred which, with or without

44  

  

 

 

  

 

  

default or material breach on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary under
any Financing Commitment Letter, and (ii) Parent has no reason to believe that
it will not be able to satisfy any material term or condition of closing of
the Financing that is required to be satisfied as a condition of the
Financing, or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent at the
Closing; provided that neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is making any
representation or warranty regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the

related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective
Representatives on the terms therein.

Section 7.02. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement dated as
of July 13, 2012 between the Company and Avista Capital Holdings, LP (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company shall (a) give Parent and its
Representatives and Financing Sources reasonable access to the offices,
properties, systems, personnel, officers, employees, agents, Contracts, books
and records of the Company, (b) furnish to Parent and its Representatives and
Financing Sources such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request, and (c) instruct the authorized
Representatives of the Company to cooperate with Parent in its investigation
of the Company. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Company;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

  

 

  

provided, however, that no investigation or access pursuant to this Section
7.02 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
or deemed made by the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent and its Representatives shall not be permitted to conduct any
"Phase II" or other intrusive environmental testing or sampling without the
prior written consent of the Company, which may be withheld at its sole
discretion.

  

  

Section 7.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) General Prohibitions. The
Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors
(collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information relating to the
Company or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records
of the Company to or otherwise cooperate in any way with any Third Party that
is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Neither the Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify
(including in the Schedule 14D-9) in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) publicly propose or announce an
intention to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing in
clauses (i) through (iv), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). The Company
shall not grant any waiver or release under any standstill, confidentiality or
similar provision of any agreement to which the Company is a party, shall
enforce to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law the standstill
provisions of any agreement to which the Company is a party and shall
immediately take steps within its power necessary to terminate any waiver that
may have been heretofore granted to any Person other than Parent and its
Affiliates under any such provisions. Any violation of the restrictions on the
Company set forth in this Section 7.03 by any Affiliate or Representative of
the Company shall be a breach of this Section 7.03 by the Company.

  

  

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 7.03(a), at any time from and after
the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Offer Closing and
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

  

  

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party (and its
Representatives) that, subject to the Company's compliance with Section
7.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a bona fide, unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation, is or would be reasonably likely to
result in a Superior

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party (and its Representatives) non-
public information relating to the Company pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only
to Parent) with such Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with
any of the provisions of this Section 7.03; provided, further, that all such
information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent,
as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided or made available to such Third Party (or its Representatives); and

  

  

(ii) subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7.03,
the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that (A)
a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change
violates its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, or (B) in the absence of
an Acquisition Proposal, if due to events or changes in circumstances after
the date hereof that were neither known nor reasonably foreseeable by the
Company as of or prior to the date hereof (such events or changes in
circumstances, collectively, an "Intervening Event"), the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change violates its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law.

  

  

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this Section 7.03, or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and
listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act.

  

  

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions
referred to in Section 7.03(b) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01(d)(i) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written
notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action and, after taking
such action, the Company shall continue to keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the applicable
Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal (including of the material terms
and conditions thereof) or any request for information relating to the Company
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company by any Third Party that may be considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. The

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the
Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details of any such
Acquisition Proposal or request. Any material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the
Company's compliance with this Section 7.03(c) and Section 7.03(d).

  

  

(d) "Last Look". (i) The Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 7.03(b)(ii)(A) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(i) unless (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in
writing at least five Business Days before taking that action, of its
intention to do so, attaching the most current version of the draft agreement
under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the
identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal, and (C) Parent
does not make, within five Business Days after its receipt of that written
notification, an offer that renders such Superior Proposal no longer a
Superior Proposal (provided that any amendment to the terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and an
additional five Business Day period under this Section 7.03(d)); and

  

  

(ii) The Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to Section 7.03(b)(ii)(B), unless, prior to taking such action, (A)
the Board of Directors has given Parent at least five Business Days prior
notice of its intention to make such Adverse Recommendation Change and a
reasonable description of the Intervening Event that serves as the basis of
such Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) at the end of such notice period, the
Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or any new transaction, agreement or structure
proposed by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would nevertheless still
constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law if such
revisions or any new transaction, agreement or structure proposed were to be
given effect, and (C) in the event of any change to the material facts and
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (A) above of this Section 7.03(d)(ii) and an additional
five Business Day notice period under clause (A) of this Section 7.03(d)(ii)
shall commence, during which time the Company shall be required to comply with
the requirements of this Section 7.03(d) anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (A) through (C) above of this Section 7.03(d)(ii).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that is
not subject to any due diligence condition and is for all of the outstanding
Shares or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company
on terms that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority
vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal,
including conditions contained therein and the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal and any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation, are more favorable from a financial point of view
to the Company's stockholders than as provided hereunder (taking into account
any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.03(d)), which the Board of Directors determines is reasonably likely
to be consummated and for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether or
not in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to
be available by the Board of Directors.

  

  

(f) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party and its Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company (and all
analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that
contains, reflects or analyzes that information), and the Company shall
provide to Parent all certifications of such return or destruction from such
other Persons as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure all such certifications as
promptly as practicable.

  

  

Section 7.04. Compensation Arrangements. As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, but in no event later than ten Business Days following the date
of this Agreement, the Company (acting through its Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee")) will take all steps
necessary to cause each Employee Plan pursuant to which consideration is
payable to any officer, director or employee to be approved by the
Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors" determined
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act
and the instructions thereto) as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)
under the 1934 Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the 1934 Act.

  

  

Section 7.05. Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall cause its

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Affiliates and Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide, in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, all reasonable
cooperation requested by Parent that is customary in connection with the
arrangement of debt financing for transactions that are substantially similar
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (a) furnish the Debt Providers in a timely manner
with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company required
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and necessary to commence the Required
Marketing Period as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter (all such
information, the "Required Information") and any supplements to the Required
Information required by the Debt Commitment Letters; (b) participate in a
reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions, road shows, rating agency
presentations and due diligence sessions; (c) furnish Parent for distribution
to the Debt Providers as promptly as practicable with pertinent information as
is customary in connection with the Debt Financing regarding the Company's
assets and operations and any security required therefor, including providing,
as promptly as practicable following a request therefor, monthly financial and
operating data relating to the Company's assets and operations that is
reasonably requested by Parent; (d) assist Parent and the Debt Providers in
the preparation of (i) a customary offering document for any of the Debt
Financing, and (ii) materials for rating agency presentations; (e) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain such UCC, bankruptcy, litigation and similar
lien searches reasonably requested by Parent and consistent with the
requirements of Parent or its lenders; (f) take all corporate actions, subject
to the consummation of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit
the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to
be made available to Parent; (g) cause the appropriate authorized
Representatives of the Company to execute and deliver any pledge and security
documents, definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents
as may be reasonably requested by Parent or otherwise facilitate the pledging
of Collateral (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) for delivery at the
consummation of the Financing at and as of the Effective Time (unless
otherwise specified, but not before the Effective Time); (h) cause the
appropriate authorized Representatives of the Company to execute and deliver
any credit agreements or indentures or other definitive financing documents on
terms satisfactory to Parent at and as of the Effective Time; (i) provide, if
requested by Parent, authorization letters to the Debt Providers authorizing
the distribution of information to prospective lenders; (j) cooperate
reasonably with the Debt Providers' due diligence, to the extent customary and
reasonable; (k) cooperate reasonably with the Debt Providers to obtain
accountant's comfort letters, which comfort letter shall comply with the
requirements of PCAOB AU Section 634, and legal opinions reasonably requested
by Parent and customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing; (l) at
least five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, provide all documentation and
other information about the Company as is reasonably requested in writing by
Parent which relates to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT
ACT; and (m) take all actions reasonably necessary to permit the Debt
Providers

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

  

 

  

to evaluate the Company's inventory, current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto. Nothing in this
Section 7.05 shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (i) require
the Company to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement, (ii) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company, or (iii) reasonably be
expected to result in a violation of Applicable Law or loss of attorney-client
privilege. No liability or obligation of the Company or its Affiliates or
Representatives, under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument relating to the Debt Financing shall be effective until the
Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
used in connection therewith, in each case other than to the extent any of the
foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of, or material breach of this Agreement by, the Company or any of its
Affiliates. Any information provided by the Company in connection with seeking
the Debt Financing shall be prepared in good faith. Parent shall reimburse the
Company for all of its documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
in connection with this Section 7.05 on or prior to the Effective Time or
promptly following the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.06. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Shares in connection with the Merger (including Company Stock Options and
Company RSUs) by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

  

  

ARTICLE 8

  

Covenants of Parent

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  

  

Section 8.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.02. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

  

  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

  

 

  

their capacity as officers or directors, as applicable, of the Company
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware Law and any other Applicable Law and permitted under the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time
to time under Applicable Law.

  

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period or time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies; provided, however,
that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the selection of such tail policy and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof, or the
Surviving Corporation shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-
year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than as provided in the Company's existing policies as
of the date hereof; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 225% of the amount per annum the Company
paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section
8.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

  

 

  

be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 8.02.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, under Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the
Company. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

  

  

Section 8.03. Employee Matters. (a) For a period of no less than twelve (12)
months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to all employees of the Company as of the Effective Time who continue
employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates ("Continuing Employees") (i)
compensation and benefits that are in the aggregate substantially comparable
to the compensation and benefits provided by the Company to the Continuing
Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits set
forth on Section 8.03(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule which Continuing
Employees would have received from the Company upon a termination of
employment immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Except as would result in a duplication of benefits, with respect to any
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in which
any Continuing Employee becomes a participant (excluding any equity
compensation or benefit accrued under a defined benefit plan), such Continuing
Employee shall receive full credit for service with the Company (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past service
credit) to the same extent that such service was recognized as of the
Effective Time under a comparable plan of the Company in which the Continuing
Employee participated.

  

  

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the welfare plans of the Company prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket maximums incurred prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Section 8.03 shall (i) be treated or construed as an
amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan, (ii)
prohibit Parent, the Company or any of Parent's Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan, (iii) obligate Parent, the Company or
any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

  

 

  

of Parent's Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any particular employee,
or (iv) confer any rights or benefits on any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.04. Financing. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (a) arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitment Letters, (b) enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto (that are customary for financings of this type) on the terms
and conditions contained in the Financing Commitment Letters, which agreements
shall be in effect as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no
event later than the Effective Time, and (c) consummate the Financing no later
than the Effective Time in accordance with the terms contained in the
Financing Commitment Letters; provided that Parent may agree to or permit any
amendment, modification or waiver of the Financing Commitment Letters that
would not, or would not reasonably be expected to, (i) materially adversely
impact (A) the ability of Parent to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) the likelihood of consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters;
provided, further, that Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of
any such amendment, modification or waiver following the execution of the
same. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitment
Letters, (1) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (2) Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from

The parties hereto agree that:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57

take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as promptly as practicable in accordance with Delaware Law.

  

  

(b) Proxy Material. The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within ten Business Days) after the date hereof, prepare and
file with the SEC in preliminary form, and shall thereafter use its reasonable
best efforts to have cleared by the SEC, the Company Proxy Statement that will
be provided to the Company's stockholders in connection with the solicitation
of proxies for use at the meeting of the Company's stockholders called to vote
upon the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of Merger (the "Company
Stockholder Meeting").

  

  

(c) Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall afford Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Company Proxy Statement
prior to its filing with the SEC, including any amendments or supplements
thereto, and shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. The Company shall (i)
promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments from the SEC with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information, (ii) promptly
provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any
of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement, (iii) provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on any
such amendment, supplement or response to the SEC, and (iv) give due

faith judgment of the Company, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, prepare, file and distribute to its stockholders any supplement
or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement, if any event shall occur that
requires such action.

  

  

(d) Company Stockholder Meeting. If adoption of this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders is required by Applicable Law and the Offer has been
terminated pursuant to Section 2.01(e), the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days) after the
Proxy Statement Clearance Date, (i) take all action necessary in accordance
with Applicable Law, Nasdaq rules, the Company's certificate of incorporation
and the Company's bylaws to establish a record date for and give notice of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, and (ii) mail to the holders of Shares as of the
record date the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall duly call, convene
and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within 35 days) following the date the Company Proxy Statement is
mailed to the Company's stockholders. Any adjournment or postponement of the
Company

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Stockholder Meeting shall require the prior written consent of Parent, except
that (A) the Company may adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in the case
and then only to the extent that such adjournment is required to allow

disclosure which the SEC has instructed the Company is necessary under
Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting, and (B) the Company, after consultation with Parent, may
(and, upon the written request of Parent, shall) adjourn or postpone the

person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at
the Company Stockholder Meeting or (2) insufficient affirmative votes to adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger; provided, that the record date shall
not be changed without Parent's consent, except as required by Applicable Law
or by the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company in effect as
of the date hereof. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption
of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be the only matter (other than (x) procedural
matters and (y) an advisory vote with respect to golden parachute compensation
arrangements in accordance with applicable federal securities laws) which the
Company shall propose to be acted on at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The
Company shall, upon the request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily

the Company Stockholder Meeting as to the aggregate tally of affirmative
proxies received by the Company. The Company shall (a) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, (b)
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholder

Merger Subsidiary and any other Subsidiary of Parent shall collectively own at
least the number of Shares necessary for Merger Subsidiary to be merged into
the Company without a vote or consent of the Company's stockholders in
accordance with Section 253 of Delaware Law, the parties shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable without the Company Stockholder Meeting in accordance with
Section 253 of Delaware Law.

  

  

Section 9.02. Regulatory Undertakings. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions

other public statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except in respect of any public statement or press

to cause any Offer Condition not to be satisfied; and

  

  

(e) any failure of that party, or any Representative thereof, to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement in this Agreement that could
reasonably be expected to cause any Offer Condition or any of the conditions

In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly of any change or event
having, or which is reasonably expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or which would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any

partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 12.04. Fees and Expenses. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided
herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

  

  

(b) Termination Fee.

  

  

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(i)
or Section 11.01(c)(iii) or by the Company pursuant to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 11.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty by wire transfer in immediately available funds
$5,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by Parent,
within one Business Day after such termination and, in the case of a
termination by the Company, immediately before and as a condition to such
termination.

  

  

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 11.01(b)(i) or Section 11.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section
11.01(c)(ii), (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to such
termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise been communicated to the Company's stockholders and not withdrawn
prior to such termination, and (C) within 12 months following the date of such
termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to or recommended to its stockholders an Acquisition Proposal or an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (provided that for purposes
of this clause (C), each reference to "10%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall
pay to Parent in immediately available funds, concurrently with the occurrence
of the applicable event described in clause (C), the Termination Fee, less any
Parent Expenses previously paid by the Company to Parent.

  

  

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 11.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(ii), then the
Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer in immediately available funds
within one Business Day after such termination, the reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Subsidiary in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Financing) in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000 (the "Parent
Expenses").

  

  

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
11.01(d)(ii), Section 11.01(d)(iii) or Section 11.01(d)(iv), Parent shall
promptly pay (but in no event later than one Business Day after the date of
such termination) to the Company as liquidated damages and not as a penalty by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, $10,000,000 in cash (the "Parent
Termination Fee").

  

  

(c) Other Costs and Expenses. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 12.04
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent
shall fail to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

  

 

  

pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by the other party in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the party who has failed to make such payments when due for
such amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or
expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date
such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date.

  

  

(d) Exclusive Remedies. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that
neither the payment of the amounts by the Company nor the payment of the
amounts by Parent specified in this Section 12.04 is a penalty, but in each
case is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
and Merger Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances
in which such fees are payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the parties agree that (i)(A) the Company's right to terminate
this Agreement and to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 12.04 and any costs and expenses pursuant to Section 12.04(b) and (B)
the specific performance remedies set forth in Section 12.13 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of the Company and its Affiliates against Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, Financing Source and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, Affiliates or Representatives (each a "Parent Related Party") for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated
hereunder to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent
or Merger Subsidiary or any other Parent Related Party shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, an
agreement executed in connection herewith (including the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Limited Guarantee and the Debt Commitment Letter) or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; and (ii)(A) Parent's right to
terminate this Agreement and to receive the Termination Fee and the Parent
Expenses, where applicable, pursuant to this Section 12.04 and any costs and
expenses pursuant to Section 12.04(b) and (B) the specific performance
remedies set forth in Section 12.13 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary against the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries former, current or future stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates or Representatives (each a "Company Related Party") for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereunder to be
consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company or any other
Company Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
In no event shall Parent be entitled to receive more than one payment of the
Termination Fee or Parent Expenses. In no event shall the Company be entitled
to receive more than one payment of the Parent Termination Fee. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing is intended to mean that no party or
its Affiliates can seek damages from the Company or any other Company Related
Party on one the hand, or from Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other Parent
Related Party on the other hand,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

  

 

  

except upon termination of this Agreement and pursuant to the liquidated
damages provisions described in this Section 12.04 or pursuant to Section
11.02(b). If, notwithstanding the parties' intent, a court determines to award
damages, (1) the Company agrees that the maximum aggregate liability (other
than liability or damages incurred or suffered as a result of fraud) of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any other Parent Related Party to the Company or
any of its Affiliates shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee and (2) Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that the
maximum aggregate liability (other than liability or damages incurred or
suffered as a result of fraud) of the Company and any other Company Related
Party to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates shall
be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Termination Fee.

  

  

Section 12.05. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. (a) The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
(i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (ii)any other representations and warranties of such party that
is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as
an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. The
mere inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty (or
covenant, as applicable) shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of any
Company SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) the Company's representations and warranties if
the relevance of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent
to a person who has read that information concurrently with such
representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part
of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

  

  

Section 12.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 8.02, shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as provided in Section 8.02, Section 12.04 and this Section
12.06, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

  

 

  

and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that the
Financing Sources and their respective current, former or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons,
Affiliates or Representatives shall be third party beneficiaries of Section
11.02, Section 12.04, this Section 12.06, Section 12.07, Section 12.08,
Section 12.09 and Section 12.14 (which may not be changed as to any Financing
Source without its prior written consent).

  

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time and, after the Acceptance
Time, to the Offer to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations under the
Offer, enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or
due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or prejudice the rights of tendering
stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer.

  

  

Section 12.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

  

  

Section 12.08. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery
Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding
in any such court or that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01
(except for notice by e-mail) shall be deemed effective service of process on
such party. Without in any way limiting any waiver of Financing Source
liability or any other provision relating to the Financing Sources and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party hereto,
nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives, will bring, or support the
bringing of, any claim, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

  

 

  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of relating in any way to the Financing Commitment Letters or the performance
thereof, anywhere other than in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof) and the laws
of New York shall govern any such action. The parties also hereby agree (a)
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law and (b) to irrevocably waive and hereby waive any right to a
trial by jury in any such action to the same extent such rights are waived
pursuant to Section 12.09.

  

  

Section 12.09. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  

  

Section 12.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Delivery of an executed signature page of
this Agreement by facsimile or other customary means of electronic
transmission (e.g., "pdf") shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart hereof.

  

  

Section 12.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 12.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 12.13. Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this Agreement shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the courts contemplated by Section 12.08, this
being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to
this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or
similar collateral in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Subsidiary to draw
down the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Commitment Letter, and to consummate the Offer and the Merger, only if (a)
with respect to the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied
at the expiration of the Offer (and which are, at the time that the Company
seeks specific performance pursuant to this Section 12.13, capable of being
satisfied if the Acceptance Time were to occur at such time)), (b) with
respect to the Merger, all of the conditions set forth in Sections 10.01 and
10.02 shall have been satisfied or waived as of the time when the Closing
would have occurred pursuant to Section 3.01 but for the failure of the Equity
Financing to be funded, (c) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at or promptly after the Offer Closing or at or prior to the Closing,
as applicable, upon delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent and/or notice from
Parent that the Equity Financing will be funded at such date, (d) Parent and
Merger Subsidiary fail to consummate the Offer or effect the Closing in
accordance with Section 2.01 or Section 3.01, respectively, and (e) with
respect to the Merger, the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the
Offer or the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be
funded at or promptly after the Acceptance Time or at or prior to the Closing,
as applicable, if the Equity Financing is funded at such time). Under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance causing Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary to
accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer pursuant to this Section 12.13 and the payment of all or
any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

Section 12.14. Certain Agreements with Respect to Debt Providers. The Company
agrees, on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties that the Debt
Providers, each other lender participating in the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing and each of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Representatives and Affiliates and each of their successors and assigns
(collectively, "Debt Related Parties") shall be subject to no liability or
claims, whether for any claims

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

  

 

  

at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, by the Company Related
Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the Debt Financing,
or the performance of services by such Debt Related Parties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 12.03, (a) no
amendment or modification to this Section 12.14 (or amendment or modification
with respect to any related definitions as they affect this Section 12.14)
shall be effective without the prior written consent of the Debt Providers and
(b) each Debt Related Party shall be an express third party beneficiary of,
and shall have the right to enforce, this Section 12.14.

(d) there is a law, rule or Order of any Governmental Authority with competent
jurisdiction directly or indirectly restraining, prohibiting, delaying or
otherwise making illegal the Offer, the acceptance for payment of or payment
for some or all of the Shares by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or the Merger;

  

  

(e) (1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
the first, second or fourth sentence of Section 5.05(a) or the first or second
sentence of Section 5.05(b) shall not be true (other than such inaccuracies as
are de minimis to (i) the equity capitalization of the Company in the
aggregate or (ii) the aggregate purchase price to be paid hereunder) at and as
of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of
such time; (2) any of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in any of Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.20 or Section 5.21
shall not be true at and as of immediately prior to the expiration of the

time, which shall be true only as of such time); or (3) any of the other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate or other writing delivered by the Company pursuant hereto
(disregarding all materiality and Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained therein except as set forth on Section I of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) shall not be true at and as of immediately prior
to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than
any such representation and warranty that by its terms addresses matters only
as of another specified time, which shall be true only as of such time),
except, in the case of this clause (3) only, where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so

(f) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or comply in any
material respect with any of its obligations, agreements or covenants under

any material limitation by any Governmental Authority in the United States
that materially affects the extension of credit generally by lenders that
regularly participate in the U.S. market in loans to large corporations, any
commencement of a war involving the United States or any commencement of armed
hostilities or other national or international calamity involving the United
States that has a material adverse effect on bank syndication or financial
markets in the United States or, in the case of any of the foregoing
occurrences existing on or at the time of the commencement of the Offer, a
material acceleration or worsening thereof;

  

  

(h) there shall have occurred any event, change, occurrence or development
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be

that Merger Subsidiary owns at least one Share more than the number of Shares
necessary for Merger Subsidiary to be merged into the Company without a vote
or consent of the Company's stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of
Delaware Law immediately after the Acceptance Time, (1) there shall exist
under Applicable Law or other restraint any restriction or legal impediment on
(i) Merger Subsidiary's ability and right to exercise the Top-Up Option, or
(ii) the Company's ability to issue the Top-Up Shares to Merger Subsidiary, or
(2) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option, when

"Top-Up Impediment"); or

  

  

(j) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

rights of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to extend, terminate or modify the
Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

Annex I - Page 2  

  

 

 

  

 

  The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
Applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than
the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or Merger Subsidiary at
any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver
of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that
may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
