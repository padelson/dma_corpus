  WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, 
certain stockholders of the Company, who collectively ownapproximately 33.8%
of the  Company Common Stock outstanding on the date hereof(collectively,

Law (the  " _DGCL_ "), at the  Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate  existence of Merger Sub shall

  SECTION  1.02   _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have  been
terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.01, the closing of the
Merger  (the " _Closing_ ") will  take place on the third Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to  applicable Law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be  satisfied until the
Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted,  waiver of
those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in Article 8, unless another 
time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the date of the
Closing,  the " _Closing Date_ "). The  Closing shall be held at the offices
of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, The Met Life Building,  200 Park Avenue, New York,
New York, unless another place is agreed to in writing by  the parties
hereto.

  

  SECTION  1.03 _Effective  Time_. Upon the Closing, the parties
shall file with the  Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a
certificate of merger (the  " _Certificate of  Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective at such  time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with and accepted by the Secretary of  State of the State of Delaware or at
such subsequent date and time as Parent and the  Company shall agree and as
shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date  and time the
Merger becomes effective being the  " _Effective  Time_ ").

  

  SECTION  1.04 _Effect of the  Merger_. From and after the
Effective Time, the effect of the  Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting  the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the 
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub  shall vest entirely in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities,  obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of
the Company and Merger  Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and  duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  SECTION  1.05 _Certificate of  Incorporation_. At the Effective
Time, the certificate of  incorporation of the Company shall be amended to
read in its entirety as the  certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the  Effective Time, and, as so amended, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the  Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as  provided therein or by
applicable Law.

  

  SECTION  1.06   _Bylaws_. The bylaws of Merger Sub as in  effect
at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and 
thereafter may be amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  SECTION  1.07 _Directors;  Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to  the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation and, unless  otherwise directed by Parent in writing
prior to the Effective Time, the officers of  the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the  Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected  and qualified
or until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL  and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation.

  

  SECTION  1.08 _Effect on  Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger  and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holders of  any of the following securities:

  



    

       

  

     |  

  2

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

  (a)   Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled
pursuant to  Section 1.08(b) and, except as provided in Section 1.08(e),
Appraisal Shares)  shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest  and subject to any required Tax withholding.
At the Effective Time, all such shares of  Company Common Stock shall cease
to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired  and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to  the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a  "
_Certificate_ ") shall  thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common  Stock, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest and  subject to any required Tax withholding.

  

  (b)   Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of
the Company  and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub,
Parent or any direct or  indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, in each case  immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be canceled without any conversion  thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  (c)   Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into  one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving  Corporation.

  

  (d)   If prior to the Effective Time, the Company should split,
combine or  otherwise reclassify the Company Common Stock, or pay a stock
dividend or other stock  distribution in Company Common Stock, or otherwise
change the Company Common Stock into  any other securities, or make any other
such stock dividend or distribution in capital  stock of the Company in
respect of the Company Common Stock, then the Merger  Consideration will be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination,  dividend or other
distribution or change.

  

  (e)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares (the  " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of  Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  that are held by any
holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this  Agreement or
consented thereto and who has properly exercised appraisal pursuant to and 
in accordance with, and who has otherwise complied with, the provisions of
Section 262  of the DGCL (" _Section  262_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive  the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
1.08(a), but instead such holder shall  be entitled only to payment of the
appraised value of such Appraisal Shares in  accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to  perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses his, her or its rights to appraisal and 
payment under the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no
longer be  outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each  holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented  Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right  to receive the appraised value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of  Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or 
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a  court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the  relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the appraised  value of such holder's Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease and such  Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and  shall

  



    

       

  

     |  

  3

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

have  become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 1.08(a).  The Company shall serve prompt written notice to Parent of
any demands for appraisal of  any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals
of any such demands and any other  related instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company, and Parent  shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with  respect to such demands.
Unless required by a final and non-appealable order, decree,  ruling or
injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not, 
without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld  or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such  demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing.

  Section 1.09

     |  

  _Treatment of  Options_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

  (a)   Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(individually a  " _Company Option_ " and  collectively, the " _Company 
Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time pursuant to
any Company Option Plan or otherwise will at the Effective  Time be cancelled
and the holder of such Company Option will, in full settlement of  such
Company Option, receive from the Company an amount (without interest and
subject  to any required Tax withholding), if any, in cash equal to the
product of (i) the  excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of  Company Common Stock underlying such Company
Option multiplied by (ii) the number of  shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, whether or not vested or  exercisable;
_provided_ that the  aggregate amount of such payment shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole cent. If  the applicable exercise price of any Company
Option equals or exceeds the Merger  Consideration, such Company Option shall
be cancelled without payment of additional  consideration, and all rights
with respect to such Company Option shall terminate as of  the Effective
Time. Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay,  the
amount of cash payable in respect of each Company Option as soon as
practicable  following the Effective Time (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days after  the Effective Time). The holders of Company Options
shall have no further rights in  respect of any Company Options from and
after the Effective Time.

  

  (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such
resolutions  and take such other actions as are necessary in order to (i)
effectuate the actions  contemplated by this Section 1.09 or to otherwise
cancel the Company Options prior to  the Effective Time and (ii) terminate
each Company Plan, including providing notice to,  or obtaining the consent
of, each holder of a Company Option necessary or desirable to  effect the
provisions of this Section 1.09, in each case without paying any 
consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company,
Parent or  the Surviving Corporation other than as contemplated by Section
1.09(a);  _provided_ that such resolutions and actions  shall expressly be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other  transactions
contemplated hereby and shall be of no effect if this Agreement is 
terminated.

  

  ARTICLE 2

  

  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  SECTION  2.01 _Exchange  Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit  with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the  Company (the " _Exchange  Agent_ "), in
trust for the benefit of holders of shares  of Company Common Stock,

  



    

       

  4

    
--- 
   

  



     

for  exchange in accordance with Section 1.08, the cash to be paid pursuant
to this  Agreement in exchange for outstanding Company Common Stock. Any cash
deposited with the  Exchange Agent, and any interest or other distributions
thereon, shall hereinafter be  referred to as the " _Exchange  Fund_." The
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the  Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, only in obligations  of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or obligations of an agency of the  United States of
America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United  States
of America, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's 
acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time  deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has
capital, surplus and  undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million
(based on the most recent  financial statements of the banks which are then
publicly available at the Securities  and Exchange Commission (the  " _SEC_
") or  otherwise); _provided_ that no such  investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to former  stockholders of the
Company, and Parent shall promptly provide, or cause the Surviving 
Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Exchange Agent for
the benefit  of the former holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of
any such  losses.

  

  SECTION  2.02 _Exchange  Procedures_. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective  Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to
each record holder of a  Certificate, (a) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery  of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such  other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (b) instructions for use in  effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the payment of the Merger 
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
each holder  of a Certificate, upon surrender of a Certificate to the
Exchange Agent together with  such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably  be required by the Exchange Agent,
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a  check in the amount
equal to the per share cash amount of the Merger Consideration  (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings), which such holder has the right  to
receive pursuant to Section 1.08. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates  upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Exchange Agent may  impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange  practices. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable upon due  surrender of the Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company  Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger  Consideration
with respect to such Company Common Stock shall be paid to such a  transferee
only if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is 
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and  effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been  paid.

  

  SECTION  2.03 _No Further  Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock_. The Merger  Consideration paid upon conversion of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with  the terms of Article 1 and this Article 2
shall be deemed to have been paid in full  satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  SECTION  2.04 _Termination of  Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains  undistributed to the holders of Certificates for
six (6) months after the Effective  Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of  the

  



    

       

  

     |  

  5

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

  Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Certificates who have not 
theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving  Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws)  for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares
of Company Common Stock  formerly represented thereby to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to Section  1.08.

  

  SECTION  2.05 _No  Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the  Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of  any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant  to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  SECTION  2.06 _Lost  Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen  or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving  Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the  Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made  against it with respect to such
Certificate or other documentation (including an  indemnity in customary
form) reasonably requested by Parent, the Exchange Agent will  deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable 
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly  represented thereby.

  

  SECTION  2.07 _Withholding  Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Corporation  and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock and  any holder of Company
Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold  with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (the " _Code_ "),  and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder  (" _Treasury  Regulations_ "), or any provision of state, local
or  foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving  Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for  all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of  Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the  Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be.

  

  SECTION  2.08 _Further  Assurances_. At and after the Effective
Time, the officers and  directors of the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in  the name and on behalf of the Company
or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,  assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company  or Merger Sub, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or  otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to
and  under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired
by the  Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger.

  

  SECTION  2.09 _Stock Transfer  Books_. At the close of business,
New York time, on the day  the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and  there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock  thereafter on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the  holders
of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of  Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise
provided herein  or by applicable Law. On or after the

  



    

       

  

     |  

  6

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

  Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or 
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with
respect to  the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

  

  ARTICLE 3

  SECTION 3.16

  _Regulatory  Matters_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

  (a)   The Company and its Subsidiaries manufacture, market, test
and  distribute and, since June 3, 2004, have manufactured, marketed, tested
and distributed  their own products in compliance with the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the  " _FDCA_ ") and all  applicable rules and
regulations of the FDA or similar applicable Laws in any state or  foreign
jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, current "Good Manufacturing 
Practices," "Quality System Regulation," "Adverse Event  Reporting," "Medical
Device Reporting" and those Laws related to  investigational use of drugs and
medical devices, marketing medical devices and drugs,  and marketing
unapproved "grandfathered drugs," regulations regarding  labeling,
advertising and record-keeping, in compliance with the Company's and  its
Subsidiaries' quality control procedures in effect at the time of 
manufacture, where the failure to be in such compliance has, individually, or
in the  aggregate, had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse  Effect. All of the products currently sold by the Company
and its Subsidiaries have  been approved or cleared for marketing by the FDA,
unless approval or clearance is not  required, as the case may be, and all
other applicable Governmental Entities performing  functions similar to those
performed by the FDA. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries
promotes or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has promoted any  "off-label"
use for such products in violation of existing Law or current  regulatory
interpretations, or received any notice in writing from the FDA or any 
Governmental Entity performing functions similar to those performed by the FDA
alleging  such illegal promotion. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any written  notice or other communication from the FDA, or any
other Governmental Entity, that has  not been fully and satisfactorily
responded to and resolved, questioning its  manufacturing, distribution or
reporting practices or threatening to revoke or curtail  any product
clearance or approval or otherwise alleging any violation of the FDCA, its 
regulations or Law applicable to any products of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.  Except as set forth in Section 3.16(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the  products of the Company or its Subsidiaries
has been recalled, withdrawn, suspended or  discontinued by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in the United States or outside the  United States, whether
voluntary or involuntary. As of the date hereof, to the  Knowledge of the
Company, there exists no basis for any action by it, the FDA or any  other
applicable Governmental Entity performing functions similar to those performed
by  the FDA to revoke, recall, suspend, cancel or withdraw any product, or
product  approval, clearance, registration, license or other authorization or
permit with  respect to any product of the Company or its Subsidiaries. All
United States and  international regulatory approvals or pre-market
notifications therefor are owned  either by and registered in the name of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or in  the name of a licensed
distributor, and are in full force and effect.

  

  (b)   Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has failed
to file with  the FDA or any applicable Governmental Entity performing
functions similar to those  performed by the FDA any material required
filing, declaration, listing, registration,  report or submission; all such
filings, declarations, listings, registrations, reports  or submissions were
to the Knowledge of the Company in compliance with applicable Laws  when
filed, and no unresolved deficiencies have been asserted by any applicable 
regulatory authority with respect to any such filings,

  declarations, listing, registrations, reports or submissions which, 
individually or in the aggregate, have had or could be reasonably expected to
have a  Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  (c)   Any clinical, pre-clinical and other studies and tests
conducted by or  on behalf of or sponsored by the Company or its Subsidiaries
were and, if still  pending, are to the Knowledge of the Company being
conducted in accordance in all  material respects with "Good Clinical
Practices" and all United States and  foreign Laws, as applicable, including
the Laws of those States that address clinical  trials. As of the date
hereof, the Company has no Knowledge of other studies or tests  the results
of which contain any significant or material inconsistencies with the 
Company's or its Subsidiaries' studies or tests or otherwise call into 
question the safety or efficacy of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' 
products. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written  notices or other correspondence from an institutional review board
or study site, the  FDA or any other applicable Governmental Entity
performing functions similar to those  performed by the FDA with respect to
any of these ongoing clinical or pre-clinical  studies or tests requiring the
termination, suspension or material modification of such  studies or tests.

  

  (d)   To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company, nor
any of its  Subsidiaries, nor any employee of the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries or any  Person retained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has made on behalf of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries
any false statement or material omissions in any  application or other
submission relating to products governed by the Department of  Health and
Human Services or other Governmental Entity.

  

  (e)   To the Knowledge of the Company, all of the manufacturing
facilities and  operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries of finished
products sold in the United  States are in material compliance with
applicable FDA regulations, including current  Good Manufacturing Practices,
when applicable, and meet quality standards set by the  FDCA, except where
the failure to be in such compliance or to meet such standards has  not,
individually or in the aggregate, had and would not reasonably be expected to
have  a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  (f)   The products sold by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
the United  States are generally classified either as over-the-counter drugs
under 21 U.S.C. §  353(b)(i), "grandfathered drugs" under 21 U.S.C. §
321(p)(1), or as  Class I and Class II Medical Devices (as defined in 21
U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(A) and  (B) and the applicable rules thereunder). The
Company and its Subsidiaries, and the  products sold by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, are in compliance in all material  respects with all current
and otherwise applicable Laws administered or issued by the  FDA and any
other applicable Governmental Entity performing functions similar to those 
performed by the FDA, except where the failure to be in such compliance has
not,  individually or in the aggregate, had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a  Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  (g)   The Company has made available to Parent all material
complaints  maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (as required by 21
C.F.R. Parts 211 and  820) and all Product Adverse Event Reports or Medical
Device Reports received or  compiled by the Company and its Subsidiaries

  (h)   Except as noted in Schedule 3.16(h), to the Knowledge of
the Company  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has committed
any act, made any  statement or failed to make any statement that would
violate the FDA's policy  with respect to "Fraud, Untrue Statements of
Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal  Gratuities" set forth in 56 Fed. Reg.
46191 (September 10, 1991) or any similar  laws, rules or regulations,
whether under the jurisdiction of the FDA or any  Governmental Entity, and
any amendments thereto. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries, nor
to the Knowledge of the Company, any officer, employee, or third  party
vendors of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries, has been convicted of any 
crime or engaged in any conduct that would reasonably be expected to result
in  (i) debarment under 21 U.S.C. § 335a or any similar state or foreign law
or  regulation or (ii) exclusion under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7 or any similar

  SECTION 6.01

     |  

  _Employee  Benefits_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

  (a)   Employees of Company and its Subsidiaries who continue
their employment  with the Surviving Corporation or who become employees of
Parent or any subsidiary of  Parent (" _Continuing  Employees_ ") shall be
given credit for all service with  the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
their respective predecessors) (or service  credited by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for similar plans, programs or policies)  under all employee
benefit and fringe benefit plans, programs and policies of the  Parent or its
Affiliates in which they become participants for purposes of eligibility, 
vesting and level of benefits (except to the extent such service credit will
result in  benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans or
otherwise result in a  duplication of benefits).

  

  (b)   For a period of at least one year following the Closing,
Parent shall,  either (i) continue to maintain the Employee Benefit Plans and
Pension Plans and cause  the Continuing

  



    

       

  

     |  

  35

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

  Employees to be covered thereunder substantially to the same extent 
covered prior to the Closing; or (ii) provide compensation and employee
benefits that,  in the aggregate, are no less favorable to those provided
under the Employee Benefit  Plans and Pension Plans immediately preceding the
Closing. Parent shall cause any of  its medical, dental or other health plans
to (x) waive any preexisting condition  limitations for conditions covered
under the applicable medical, health or dental plans  of the Company (the "
_Company Welfare  Plans_ "); and (y) honor any deductible and out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her beneficiaries under the
Company  Welfare Plans during the portion of the applicable plan year
including the Closing. It  is expressly acknowledged and agreed that nothing
contained herein shall require a  Continuing Employee's participation in the
Bracco Retirement Income  Plan.

  

  (c)   To the extent that Parent is a "successor employer," as
such  term is defined in Section 54.4980B-9 of the Treasury Regulations,
Parent shall satisfy  and be fully responsible for any and all obligations
arising under Section 4980B of the  Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder  (" _COBRA_ ") with respect  to such employees, former employees
and their respective spouses and dependents who  participate in any Employee
Benefit Plans that are group health plans (within the  meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code) and who are "MandA Qualified  Beneficiaries" (as such
term is defined in Section 54.4980B-9 of the Treasury  Regulations) with such
coverage provided through any health plan maintained by Parent  (if the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan is terminated). Parent shall satisfy and
be  fully responsible for any and all COBRA obligations that arise with
respect to any  MandA Qualified Beneficiary (as such terms is determined in
Section 54.4980B-9)  entitled to elect continuation coverage pursuant to
COBRA as a result of a  "qualifying event" that occurred on or prior to the
Closing  Date.

  

  (d)   Except as provided in this Section 6.01, nothing in this
Agreement shall  limit or restrict the right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to modify, amend,  terminate or establish employee benefit plans
or arrangements, in whole or in part, at  any time after the Effective Time.

  

  (e)   No provision of this Section 6.01 shall create any third
party  beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee or any current or former
director or  consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries located in the
United States in respect  of continued employment (or resumed employment) or
any other matter.

  

  SECTION  6.02   _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and 
Insurance_. (a) Without limiting any additional rights that  any employee,
officer or director may have under any employment agreement, Employee 
Benefits Plan, the Company Organization Documents, indemnification agreement
or  otherwise, after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of
immediately prior to  the Effective Time) and former officer or director of
the Company and its Subsidiaries  (collectively, the " _Indemnified 
Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities,  damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,  including,
attorneys' fees and disbursements (collectively,  " _Costs_ "), incurred in 
connection with any Action, arising out of actions taken by them in their
capacity as  officers or directors at or prior to the Effective Time
(including with respect to this  Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or  claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent  permitted

  



    

       

  

     |  

  36

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

under  applicable Law for a period of six years from the Effective Time. Each
Indemnified  Party will be entitled to advancement of reasonably documented
expenses (including  reasonable attorney's fees) incurred in the defense for
any such Action from the  Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days
of receipt by the Surviving  Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor;  _provided_ that any Indemnified Party to whom  expenses
are so advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is 
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
The  Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior  written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). The  Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise
or consent to the entry of any  judgment in any pending or threatened Action
that names an Indemnified Party as a  defendant, unless (i) such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional  release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or (ii)  such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent  Costs
are covered by insurance and actually paid to the Indemnified Party pursuant
to  such insurance coverage (" _Insurance  Proceeds_ "), and either Parent
or the Surviving  Corporation has made a payment to the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Costs  under this Section 6.02, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay to Parent or the  Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, an amount in cash equal to the excess amount  of Insurance Proceeds
received by such Indemnified Party over the amount of Costs that  have not
been reimbursed by the Surviving Corporation at the at the time of receipt
of  such Insurance Proceeds.

  

  (b)   The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving  Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification  than are set forth in the Company Organizational
Documents, which provisions shall not  be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective  Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals  who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, 
fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be
required by  applicable Law. The indemnification agreements between the
Company and its directors  and officers as in effect on the date thereof
shall not be amended, terminated or  otherwise modified by the Surviving
Corporation for a period of six years from the  Effective Date.

  

  (c)   The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company intends,
prior to the  Effective Time, to purchase directors' and officers' liability
insurance  coverage under a run-off or tail policy providing, for a period of
six years after  the Effective Time (and at a total cost currently estimated
not to exceed  $280,000), the same coverage amounts and terms and conditions
as those  in the policy of directors' and officers' liability  insurance
currently maintained by the Company. If such insurance policy is  in effect
at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall 
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such insurance policy in effect
for a  period of six years after the Effective Time. The parties agree that,
if for any reason  such run-off or tail policy is not in effect at the
Effective Time, as  promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter Parent
shall, or shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to, obtain a commercially
available run-off or tail policy, which  shall (i) be for a term of six years
from the Effective Time, (ii) provide coverage for  each person covered by
the Company's current directors' and  officers' liability insurance policy in
effect on the date hereof, and (iii)  be no less favorable with respect to
coverage terms and amounts in any material  respect than the Company's
current directors' and officers' liability  insurance policy;  _provided_ ,

---|--- 
   

  



     

  _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or  the Surviving Corporation be
obligated or required to pay premiums for such  policy under this Section
6.02(c) in excess of 200% of the amount of the  current net annual premiums
paid by the Company for such directors' and  officers' liability insurance
policy (which current net annual premiums are  hereby represented and
warranted by the Company to be $85,000).

  

  (d)   In the event the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent or any of  their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any  other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such  consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its  properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision  shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company, the Surviving  Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, or at Parent's option, Parent, shall  expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.02.

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which  discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties

  SECTION 7.04

     |  

  _Acquisition  Proposal_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

  (a)   The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
its and  their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any existing
solicitations,  discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
Parent and its Affiliates) that  has made or indicated an intention to make
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall  use commercially reasonable
efforts to have all copies of all non-public information it  or its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives have distributed since 
February 26, 2007 to Persons who have executed a confidentiality agreement
in  connection with such Persons' consideration of an Acquisition Proposal
(other  than with respect to Parent and its Affiliates), destroyed or
returned to the Company  as soon as possible.

  

  (b)   Except as set forth in this Section 7.04, the Company shall
not, and  shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not permit their
respective  Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly  encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-
public information) any  Acquisition Proposal or the making or receipt
thereof, including approving any  transaction (or any Person (other than
Parent and its Affiliates) becoming an  "interested stockholder") under
Section 203 of the DGCL, or (ii) initiate,  participate in or knowingly
encourage or facilitate any discussions or negotiations  regarding, furnish
to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) any information  with
respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person (or
any  Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate  in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal or the making
or receipt thereof;  _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, at any time prior to
the  Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide
written Acquisition  Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 7.04, the Company may  furnish, or cause to be furnished, non-public
information with respect to the Company  and its Subsidiaries to the Person
who made such proposal  ( _provided_ that all such information  has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or 
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person) and
may  participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such proposal if
(x) the  Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice
of its outside legal  counsel and financial advisor), that (A) the failure to
take such action would  reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law  and (B) such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is  reasonably likely to result in
a Superior Proposal, and (y) prior to taking such  action, the Company enters
into a confidentiality agreement with respect to such  proposal that contains
confidentiality and standstill provisions no less restrictive  than the
Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
7.04(b)  by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed a  breach of this Section 7.04(b) by the Company. The Company
shall promptly advise Parent  orally (with written confirmation to follow
within 24 hours) after receipt by the  Company of any Acquisition Proposal,
including the material terms and conditions  thereof and the identity of the
Person making any such Acquisition Proposal (attaching,  if available, a true
and complete copy thereof). The Company shall keep Parent  reasonably
informed on a prompt basis of the status and material terms (including all 
changes to the status and material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal.
From and  after the date hereof, the Company shall not and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to  enter into any confidentiality or other agreement with
any Person or group that  restricts or prohibits the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from providing to Parent  the foregoing information regarding

  



    

       

  

     |  

  43

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

  (including the identity of the Person submitting) an Acquisition  Proposal
or which provides for any exclusive right of negotiation or dealing. The 
Company agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any provisions
of, any  confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a
party and shall use  its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any such
agreement at the request of or  on behalf of Parent, unless the Company Board
determines in good faith (after receiving  the advice of its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) that such action (or  inaction, in the case of
failing to provide any such release or waiver) would be  inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  

  (c)   Prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, neither the
Company Board nor  any committee thereof shall (r) withdraw or qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to  Parent or Merger Sub or propose (publicly or
otherwise) to withdraw or to qualify or  modify in a manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (s)  approve, adopt or recommend,
or propose (publicly or otherwise) to approve, adopt or  recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal to holders of the Company Common Stock (any of (r)  and
(s), an " _Adverse  Recommendation_ ") or (t) cause or permit the Company
or  any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of  understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option  agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or similar agreement (x)  constituting or relating to, or that is intended or
would reasonably be expected to  lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to  in Section 7.04(b) entered into
in the circumstances referred to in such Section  7.04(b), or (y) requiring
the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the  Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any of (x) and (y), an  "
_Acquisition  Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject  to
the Company's compliance at all times with the provisions of Section 7.04,
(I)  if a written Acquisition Proposal is made prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval,  the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation,
if (but only if):

  

  (i)   the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
receiving the  advice of its outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
that (A) it is required to  make such Adverse Recommendation in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties under  applicable Law, and (B) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior  Proposal;

  

  (ii)   the Company shall have provided Parent five (5) Business
Days'  prior notice (the " _Notice  Period_ ") following Parent's receipt of
written  notice (a " _Notice of Superior  Proposal_ ") from the Company (A)
representing to Parent  that the Company Board has received a Superior
Proposal not in violation of the  provisions of Section 7.04, (B) specifying
the material terms and conditions of such  Superior Proposal (and attaching,
if available, the most current and complete version  of any written agreement
or offer relating thereto), (C) identifying the Person making  such Superior
Proposal and (D) stating that the Company Board intends to make an  Adverse
Recommendation; it being understood and agreed that, prior to any such
Adverse  Recommendation occurring, any amendment to the consideration to be
paid in connection  with such Superior Proposal or material amendment to such
Superior Proposal shall  require a new Notice of Superior Proposal with
respect to such amendments (a  " _Subsequent Notice_ ") and  a new three (3)
Business Day Notice Period (a  " _Subsequent Notice  Period_ ");

  



    

       

  

     |  

  44

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

  (iii)   during such Notice Period or Subsequent Notice Period, as
the case may  be, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have engaged in
good faith negotiations  with Parent and its Representatives so as to permit
Parent to propose to amend this  Agreement in such a manner that the
Acquisition Proposal that was determined to  constitute a Superior Proposal
is no longer determined to constitute a Superior  Proposal; and

  

  (iv)   at the end of the Notice Period or any Subsequent Notice
Period, as the  case may be, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn
and continues to  constitute a Superior Proposal,

  

and  (II) after an Adverse Recommendation is made in accordance with the
foregoing clause  (I), the Company shall be entitled to enter into a
definitive and binding Acquisition  Agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal if (but only if) this Agreement is  terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(e) and, concurrently with and as a  condition to the
effectiveness of any such termination by the Company, the Company  shall,
concurrently with entering into such definitive and binding Acquisition 
Agreement, have paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant to Section 9.02. The
Company  agrees that it will not enter into an Acquisition Agreement
providing for a Superior  Proposal referred to in this Section 7.04(c) until
at least the sixth (6th)  Business Day after it has provided the Notice of
Superior Proposal or until at least  the third (4th) Business Day after it
has provided a Subsequent Notice, as  the case may be.

  

  (d)   Nothing contained in this Section 7.04 shall prohibit the
Company  from at any time taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by  Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure  required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, Rule 14e-2(b)  promulgated under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or from  making any other disclosure to its
stockholders or in any other regulatory filing if,  in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board (after receiving the advice of its  outside
legal counsel and financial advisor), failure to so disclose would be 
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;  _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (solely except in the case of  a "stop-look-and-listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the  Exchange Act) if any such
disclosure does not concurrently and expressly reaffirm the  Company
Recommendation or if it has the effect of withdrawing or qualifying or 
modifying in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Company
Recommendation, then  such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation for all purposes of  this Agreement and Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as set forth  in Section 9.01(f) and
receive the Break-Up Fee in accordance with Sections 9.02 and  9.03.

  

  SECTION  7.05 _Stockholder  Litigation_. The Company shall keep
Parent informed of, and  Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company
in connection with, any stockholder  litigation or claim against the Company
and/or its directors or officers relating to  the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no settlement in connection  with such stockholder litigation shall be agreed
to without Parent's prior  written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  SECTION  7.06 _Public  Announcements_. The initial press release
relating to this  Agreement shall be a joint release the text of which has
been agreed to by each of  Parent and the

  



    

       

  

     |  

  45

    
---|--- 
   

  



     

  Company. Thereafter, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees 
that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby  shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and  Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such  release or announcement may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations  of any applicable securities
exchange, in which case the party required to make the  release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each 
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of  such issuance; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that upon prior
consultation with  the other party, each of the parties may make statements
that are not inconsistent with  previous press releases, public disclosures
or public statements made by any of the  parties in compliance with this
Section 7.06.

  

  SECTION  7.07 _Tyco  Litigation_. After the date hereof, the
Company shall, to the  full extent permitted by Law and (to the extent
necessary to preserve the  attorney-client privilege) subject to a customary
joint defense agreement, (a) promptly  inform Parent orally (with written
confirmation to follow within two (2) Business Days)  of all material
developments relating to the Tyco Litigation, (b) consult with Parent  with
respect to any material action it intends to take in connection with the
Tyco  Litigation prior to taking such action, (c) provide, or cause to be
provided, to Parent  copies of all pleadings, responses, analyses, opinions,
correspondence and other  documents related to the Tyco Litigation
(collectively,  " _Tyco Litigation  Documents_ "), (d) give Parent
reasonable opportunity (at  least two (2) Business Days) to comment on any
Tyco Litigation Document that is  prepared by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Affiliates prior to the delivery  of such Tyco Litigation Document
to or filing with a Governmental Entity or other third  party and (e) give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement, 
compromise or resolution of the Tyco Litigation, in whole or in part. The
Company shall  not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not
to, take any action  intended to settle, compromise or resolve the Tyco
Litigation, in whole or in part,  without Parent's prior written consent.

  

  SECTION  7.08 _J.D. Edwards  ERP Implementation Project._ As
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the  Company shall cause those
of its Representatives who are responsible for the J.D.  Edwards ERP
Implementation Project to meet with Representatives of Parent and engage in 
good faith discussions and negotiations regarding the timing of, and capital 
expenditures associated with, the J.D. Edwards ERP Implementation Project.

available to Bracco Imaging for use in connection with Parent's  and Merger
Sub's payment obligations under this Agreement.  

  

  SECTION  7.10 _Cimbar  Agreement._ Parent hereby agrees that, at
the Effective Time, it shall accept and  assume (or cause any of its

30, 2007 (the "Cimbar Agreement"), by and among the Company, E-Z-EM  Canada,
Inc., and will agree (or cause such Affiliate) to be bound by all of the

attributable  to a termination of this Agreement as referenced in Sections
9.02 and 9.03 are  uncertain in amount, (ii) the fees provided in Sections
9.02 and 9.03 are a reasonable  fee and estimate of such damages at the time
the parties hereto executed and delivered  this Agreement and (iii) the
amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 9.03  constitute liquidated
damages negotiated at arm's-length and do not constitute,  and are not
intended by the parties to operate as, a penalty.

  

  SECTION  9.04   _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by  the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of 
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection  with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, but, after

representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered 
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions  contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or  waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of  such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights  under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those  rights.

prior  written consent of the other parties hereto and any such attempted
assignment without  such prior written consent shall be void and of no force

with,  and governed by, the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice  or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other  jurisdiction). The parties hereto irrevocably
elect as the sole judicial forum for the  adjudication of any matters arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, and  consent to the jurisdiction
of, the courts of the State of Delaware.

  

  (b)   Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of  (i) the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or other
appropriate state court in  the State of Delaware), and (ii) the United
States District Court for the District of  Delaware, for the purposes of any
Action arising out of this Agreement or any  transaction contemplated hereby.
Each party hereto agrees to commence any Action  relating hereto in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or, if such Action may  not be
brought in such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction in the
United  States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each party hereto
irrevocably and  unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any Action arising out  of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in (A) the Chancery Court of  the State of Delaware, or (B) the United
States District Court for the District of  Delaware, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to  plead or claim in
any such court that any such Action brought in any such court has  been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto further irrevocably
consents  to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts
in any such Action by  the mailing of copies thereof by mail to such party at
its address set forth in this  Agreement, such service of process to be
effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of  such registered mail; provided
that nothing in this Section 10.03 shall affect the  right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable  Law. The
consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 10.03 shall not constitute
a  general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall
have no effect  for any purpose except as provided in this Section 10.03. The
parties hereto agree that  a final judgment in any such Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable  Law. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such  party as
provided in Section 10.05 as to giving notice thereunder shall be deemed 
effective service of process on such party.

  

  (c)   Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other parties
would be  damaged irreparably if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance  with its specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, the parties will be  entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this  Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and its provisions in any Action  instituted in
any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware having 
jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy
to which  they may be entitled, at Law or in equity. Except as expressly
provided herein, the  rights, obligations and remedies created by this
Agreement are cumulative and in  addition to any other rights, obligations or
remedies otherwise available at Law or in  equity. Except as expressly
provided herein, nothing herein will be considered an  election of remedies.

  

  (d)   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES  HEREBY WAIVES
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY, IN ANY  MATTERS
(WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, 
RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH, THIS

  AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES

RIGHT IT MAY  HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY

(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT  OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER  PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND  (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY,  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION  10.03(D).

     |  

  _Severability;  Construction_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

  (a)   Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable  in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of  the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the  offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the  final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision  hereof
is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such  determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to
delete specific  words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a  term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing  the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement  shall be enforceable as
so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the  power granted to
it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such  invalid
or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or 
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other  purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

  

  (b)   This Agreement has been freely and fairly negotiated among
the parties.  If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement will be  construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof  will arise favoring or disfavoring any party
because of the authorship of any provision  of this Agreement. Any reference
to any applicable Law will be deemed to refer to such  Law as in effect on
the date hereof and all rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder, unless
the context requires otherwise. The words "include,"  "includes," and
"including" will be deemed to be followed by  "without limitation." Pronouns
in masculine, feminine, and neuter genders  will be construed to include any
other gender, and words in the singular form will be  construed to include
the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires.  The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereof,"  "hereby," "hereunder," and words of
similar import refer to  this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so  limited. The parties intend that each
representation, warranty, and covenant contained  herein will have
independent significance. Time is of the essence in the performance of  this
Agreement.

their respective successors and permitted  assigns. Nothing in this Agreement
