          (c) If only one of Buyer,  Parent or Maestro shall deliver a Notice of

dispute  within 15  Business  Days  following  the  delivery  of such  Notice of

of  Disagreement  shall be deemed to have  irrevocably  accepted the  Adjustment
Amount  Documents  as  modified  in the  manner  described  in  such  Notice  of
Disagreement.

          (d) If (i) Buyer,  Parent or Maestro delivers a Notice of Disagreement
within the  15-Business  Day period set forth in Section  1.4(b) or (ii)  Buyer,
Parent or Maestro shall dispute a Notice of Disagreement delivered by one of the
other parties within the 15-Business Day period set forth in Section 1.4(c), and
within 15 Business Days following the delivery to Buyer,  Parent or Maestro,  as
the case may be, of the notice of such  dispute,  the parties do not resolve the
Disagreement  (as evidenced by a written  agreement  between them), in each case
such  Disagreement  shall  thereafter be referred to the Independent  Accounting
Firm for a resolution of such  Disagreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.  The  determinations  of such firm with  respect to any  Disagreement
shall be rendered within 15 Business Days after referral of the  Disagreement to

binding upon the parties, the amount so determined shall be used to complete the

pursuant to this Section  1.4(d)  shall be paid 50% by Buyer,  25% by Parent and
25% by Maestro  (except that, in the event that Parent or Maestro is not a party
to such Disagreement, Maestro or Parent, respectively, shall pay 50%).

          (e) Promptly after the Adjustment  Amount  Documents have been finally
determined in accordance  with this Section 1.4  (including by means of a deemed
acceptance of such documents by Buyer,  Parent or Maestro as provided in Section
1.4(b) and (c),  respectively),  but in no event later than five  Business  Days
following such final  determination (the "Initial  Supplemental  Closing Date"),
the parties hereto shall hold a supplemental closing (the "Initial  Supplemental
Closing"),  either by telephone or in person at a mutually convenient  location.
If the Working Capital Amount is less than the Required  Working Capital Amount,
each Member shall deliver to Buyer on the Initial  Supplemental  Closing Date an

Business Days prior to the Initial Supplemental Closing Date) of such difference
by Wire Transfer as set forth in instructions from Buyer. If the Working Capital
Amount is greater than the Required Working Capital Amount (the difference,  the

delivered, to each Member cash as determined pursuant to Section 1.4(f).

          (f) The provisions of this Section 1.4(f) shall be applicable  only in

Supplemental Closing Date:

     (i) if the Accounts Receivable Differential is negative or zero, Buyer
     shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered,  to the Members an amount in
     cash equal to the sum of (x) the absolute value of the Accounts  Receivable
     Differential and (y) the Satisfied Accounts Receivable Amount; or

     (ii) if the Accounts Receivable Differential is positive,  Buyer shall
     deliver,  or shall cause to be delivered,  to the Members an amount in cash
     equal to the excess,  if any, of the Satisfied  Accounts  Receivable Amount
     over the Accounts Receivable Differential.

On the last Business Day of each of the six full calendar months following the
Initial Supplemental Closing Date and thereafter two Business Days following
receipt from time to time of any Satisfied Accounts Receivable Amounts (each, a
"Supplemental Closing Date"), if any amounts are required to be paid pursuant to
this Section 1.4(f), the parties hereto shall hold a supplemental closing (each,
a "Supplemental Closing"), either by telephone or in person at a mutually
convenient location.

On the applicable Supplemental Closing Date:

     (i) if clause (i) above applies, Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be
     delivered, to the Members on the applicable Supplemental Closing Date, the
     Satisfied Accounts Receivable Amount, if any; or

     (ii) if clause (ii) above applies, Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to
     be delivered, to the Members on the applicable Supplemental Closing Date,
     an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the Cumulative
     Satisfied Accounts Receivable Amount over the sum of (B) the Accounts
     Receivable Differential and any amounts previously paid by Buyer pursuant
     to this Section 1.4(f).

On each Supplemental Closing Date, if any, Buyer shall also deliver to each
Member a supporting statement that shows the applicable calculations with
respect to such Supplemental Closing. Any disputes with respect to such
calculations shall be governed by and resolved in accordance with the provisions
set forth in Section 1.4(b), (c) and (d) and shall be reflected in the
Supplemental Closing following resolution of the dispute, provided, however,
that if any disputes pursuant to this Section 1.4(f) are resolved following the
occurrence of the last Supplemental Closing, any amounts due by Buyer to the
Members or vice versa shall be paid in cash within two Business Days of final
resolution of all outstanding disputes under this Section 1.4(f). Any amounts
due to the Members from Buyer or due to Buyer from the Members pursuant to this
Section 1.4(f) shall be paid to or by the Members in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule by Wire Transfer as set forth in instructions from Buyer or
the Members, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
aggregate payments by Buyer to the Members pursuant to this Section 1.4(f) shall
not exceed the Excess Working Capital Amount.

          Section 1.5.  Contingent Purchase Consideration.  The parties hereto
                        ----------------------------------
hereby incorporate by reference the terms and agreements set forth in Exhibit

          Section 1.6.  Fund  Adjustment.
                        ---------------

after the Closing  Date,  on the 30th day following the earlier of (x) the first
date on which the Fund Consent  Ratio equals or exceeds 90% or (b) the 150th day
after the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer, Parent and Maestro a
statement  (the "Fund  Accounting")  setting forth the  calculation  of the Fund
Consent  Ratio  and any  applicable  Fund  Payment,  which  shall  set  forth in
reasonable  detail the calculation of such numbers,  which  calculation shall be
made  in a  manner  consistent  in all  respects  with  the  provisions  of this
Agreement.  The Company,  Buyer,  Parent and Maestro shall consult and cooperate
with respect to the Company's  preparation of such documents.  Following receipt
of the Fund Accounting, solely for the purpose of reviewing such Fund Accounting
as it relates to any Fund  Payment,  Buyer  shall  cause the  Company to provide
Maestro and Parent reasonable access to the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries  and to their personnel and accountants  during normal business
hours at the request of Parent or Maestro,  as  applicable;  provided,  however,
that such  access  shall be  conducted  in a manner  that does not  unreasonably
interfere   with  the   operation  of  the  business  of  the  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries.

          (c)  Within 15  Business  Days  after  delivery  to Buyer,  Parent and
Maestro of the Fund Accounting, any of such Persons may dispute all or a portion
of such Fund  Accounting by giving written  notice (a "Fund Dispute  Notice") to
the Company of the Fund Accounting, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for any  such  dispute  (any  such  dispute  being  hereinafter  called  a "Fund
Dispute"). The parties shall promptly commence good faith


                                      -21-

negotiations with a view to resolving all such Fund Disputes. If none of Buyer,
Parent nor Maestro provides a Fund Dispute Notice within the 15-Business Day
period set forth in this Section 1.6(c), the parties shall be deemed to have
accepted such Fund Accounting in the form delivered to them by the Company.

          (d) If any party shall  deliver a Fund Dispute  Notice and none of the
other parties  disputes all or any portion of such Fund Dispute Notice by giving
written  notice to the party that delivered  such Fund Dispute  Notice,  setting
forth in  reasonable  detail the basis for such dispute  within 15 Business Days
following  the  delivery of such Fund Dispute  Notice,  such parties who fail to
dispute all or any portion of such Fund  Dispute  Notice shall be deemed to have
irrevocably  accepted the Fund Accounting as modified in the manner described in
such Fund Dispute Notice.

          (e) If (i) any of Buyer,  Parent or Maestro  delivers  a Fund  Dispute
Notice within the 15-Business Day period set forth in Section 1.6(c) or (ii) any
of Buyer, Parent or Maestro shall dispute a Fund Dispute Notice delivered by one
of the other  parties  within  the  15-Business  Day period set forth in Section
1.6(d), and within 15 Business Days following the delivery to Buyer,  Maestro or
Parent,  as the case may be, of the notice of such  dispute,  the parties do not
resolve the Fund Dispute (as evidenced by a written  agreement between them), in
each case such Fund  Dispute  shall  thereafter  be referred  to an  Independent
Accounting  Firm for a resolution  of such Fund Dispute in  accordance  with the
terms  of  this  Agreement;   provided,   that  any  Fund  Dispute  relating  to
interpretation  of this Agreement that is not resolved by the parties after good
faith  negotiations (as evidenced by a written  agreement between them) shall be
resolved  pursuant to the  arbitration  process  described  in Section  9.8. The
determinations  of the  Independent  Accounting  Firm with  respect  to any Fund
Dispute  shall be rendered  within 15 Business  Days after  referral of the Fund
Dispute to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably  practicable,  shall be
final and binding upon the parties,  the amount so  determined  shall be used to
complete  the final Fund  Accounting  to the extent in dispute  and the  parties
agree that the  procedures  set forth in this  Section 1.6 shall be the sole and
exclusive  remedy with  respect to the  determination  of the amount of any Fund
Payment.  Buyer,  Parent and  Maestro  shall use their  commercially  reasonable
efforts to cause the  Independent  Accounting  Firm to render its  determination
within the 15-Business Day period described in the previous  sentence,  and each
shall  cooperate  with such firm and provide such firm with access to the books,
records,  personnel and representatives of it and such other information as such
firm may  require  in order to  render  its  determination.  All of the fees and
expenses of the Independent  Accounting  Firm retained  pursuant to this Section
1.6(e) shall be paid 50% by Buyer,  25% by Parent and 25% by Maestro;  provided,
however, that if Parent or Maestro is not a party to the Dispute referred to the

Amended  and  Restated  EAP and  none of  Buyer,  the  Company  or any of  their

which  constitute all of the  obligations  and  liabilities set forth therein or
arising thereunder.

          Section 1.8.  Valuation and Run-Rate Escrow Release.
                        -------------------------------------
          (a) The Company  shall deliver to Buyer and the Members not later than
30 days  following  the Consent  Expiration  Date (the "Revised  Closing  Client
Revenue  Run-Rate  Determination  Date") a true,  complete and correct  schedule
setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Revised Closing Client
Revenue Run-Rate (the "Escrow Release Accounting").  The Company,  Buyer, Parent
and  Maestro  shall  consult  and  cooperate   with  respect  to  the  Company's
preparation of the Escrow Release  Accounting.  Following  receipt of the Escrow
Release  Accounting,  solely for the purpose of  reviewing  such Escrow  Release
Accounting as it relates to any amounts  payable  under this Section 1.8,  Buyer
shall cause the Company to provide Maestro and Parent  reasonable  access to the
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their personnel and
accountants during normal business hours at the request of Parent or Maestro, as
applicable;  provided,  however, that such access shall be conducted in a manner
that does not  unreasonably  interfere with the operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

          (b)  Within 15  Business  Days  after  delivery  to Buyer,  Parent and
Maestro of the Escrow Release Accounting, any of such Persons may dispute all or
a portion of such Escrow Release Accounting by giving written notice (an "Escrow
Dispute Notice") to the Company of the Escrow Release Accounting,  setting forth
in  reasonable  detail  the basis for any such  dispute  (any such  dispute,  an
"Escrow  Dispute").  The parties shall promptly commence good faith negotiations
with a view to resolving all such Escrow Disputes.  If none of Buyer, Parent nor
Maestro  provides an Escrow Dispute Notice within the 15-Business Day period set
forth in this Section 1.8(b),  the parties shall be deemed to have accepted such
Escrow Release Accounting in the form delivered to them by the Company.


                                      -23-


<PAGE>


          (c) If any party shall  deliver an Escrow  Dispute  Notice and none of
the other parties  disputes all or any portion of such Escrow  Dispute Notice by
giving written  notice to the party that  delivered such Escrow Dispute  Notice,
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute within 15 Business
Days following the delivery of such Escrow Dispute Notice, such parties who fail
to dispute all or any portion of such Escrow  Dispute  Notice shall be deemed to
have  irrevocably  accepted  the Escrow  Release  Accounting  as modified in the
manner described in such Escrow Dispute Notice.

          (d) If (i) any of Buyer,  Parent or Maestro delivers an Escrow Dispute
Notice within the 15-Business Day period set forth in Section 1.8(b) or (ii) any
of Buyer,  Parent or Maestro shall dispute an Escrow Dispute Notice delivered by
one of the other parties within the  15-Business Day period set forth in Section
1.8(c), and within 15 Business Days following the delivery to Buyer,  Maestro or
Parent,  as the case may be, of the notice of such  dispute,  the parties do not
resolve the Escrow Dispute (as evidenced by a written  agreement  between them),
in each case such Escrow Dispute shall  thereafter be referred to an Independent
Accounting  Firm for a resolution of such Escrow Dispute in accordance  with the
terms  of  this  Agreement;  provided,  that  any  Escrow  Dispute  relating  to
interpretation  of this Agreement that is not resolved by the parties after good
faith  negotiations (as evidenced by a written  agreement between them) shall be
resolved  pursuant to the  arbitration  process  described  in Section  9.8. The
determinations  of the  Independent  Accounting  Firm with respect to any Escrow
Dispute shall be rendered  within 15 Business Days after  referral of the Escrow
Dispute to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably  practicable,  shall be
final and binding upon the parties,  the amount so  determined  shall be used to
complete the final Escrow  Release  Accounting  to the extent in dispute and the
parties  agree that the  procedures  set forth in this  Section 1.8 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the determination of the amount of any
payment  under this  Section  1.8.  Buyer,  Parent and  Maestro  shall use their
commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause the  Independent  Accounting  Firm to
render its  determination  within the  15-Business  Day period  described in the
previous sentence, and each shall cooperate with such firm and provide such firm
with access to the books, records,  personnel and representatives of it and such
other information as such firm may require in order to render its determination.
All of the  fees  and  expenses  of any  Independent  Accounting  Firm  retained
pursuant to this Section  1.8(h)  shall be paid 50% by Buyer,  25% by Parent and
25% by Maestro;  provided,  however, that if Parent or Maestro is not a party to
the Dispute  referred to the  Independent  Accounting  Firm,  Maestro or Parent,
respectively, shall pay 50% of such fees and expenses.

          (e)  Promptly  after the Escrow  Release  Accounting  has been finally
determined in accordance  with this Section 1.8  (including by means of a deemed
acceptance  of such  documents  by  Buyer,  Parent or  Maestro  as  provided  in
paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this  Section  1.8),  but in no event later than five
Business  Days  following  such final  determination  (the  "Additional  Payment
Date"),  the parties hereto shall hold a supplemental  closing (the  "Additional
Payment  Closing"),  either by telephone  or in person at a mutually  convenient
location.  At the Additional Payment Closing,  if (i) the Revised Closing Client
Revenue  Run-Rate  is equal to or greater  than 90% of the Base  Client  Revenue
Run-Rate,  (a) the Run-Rate Escrow Amount (net of applicable Parent  Transaction
Fees and Maestro  Transaction Fees), with interest accrued from the Closing Date
up to, but not  including,  the  Additional  Payment  Date at the rate to be set
forth in the Escrow  Agreement,  shall be  released  to each Member in an amount
equal to its allocation of such amount as described on the Closing Consideration

instructions  designating  the  accounts  to which such  amounts are to be paid,
shall be  delivered  by Wire  Transfer  as  instructed  by Parent  and  Maestro,
respectively  or (ii) the Revised  Closing Client Revenue  Run-Rate is less than
90% of the Base Client Revenue  Run-Rate,  (a) an amount equal to the Additional
Payment  Amount  (net  of  applicable   Parent   Transaction  Fees  and  Maestro
Transaction  Fees) shall be  released  to each Member in an amount  equal to its
allocation  of such amount as  described on the Closing  Consideration  Exhibit,
with  interest  accrued  from the  Closing  Date up to, but not  including,  the
Additional  Payment  Date at the rate to be set forth in the  Escrow  Agreement,
delivered by Wire  Transfer as  instructed  by each Member,  (b) the  applicable
Parent  Transaction  Fees and  Maestro  Transaction  Fees with  respect to which
Maestro or Parent,  respectively,  has informed Buyer at least two Business Days
prior  to  the  date  on  which  payment  is to be  made  of the  Wire  Transfer
instructions designating the accounts to which such amounts are to be paid shall
be delivered by Wire Transfer as instructed by Parent and Maestro, respectively,
and (c) an amount equal to the Run-Rate  Escrow  Amount,  with interest  accrued
from the Closing Date up to, but not including,  the Additional  Payment Date at
the rate to be set forth in the Escrow  Agreement,  less the Additional  Payment
Amount and any  interest  earned  thereon as set forth in this  Section  1.8(e),
shall be released to Buyer,  delivered by Wire  Transfer as instructed by Buyer.
The payment to the Members to be made  pursuant to this  Section  1.8(e) (net of
the applicable  Parent  Transaction Fees and Maestro  Transaction Fees) shall be
defined as the "Run-Rate Payment" for purposes of the Amended and Restated EAP.

other documents,  together with any amendments  required to be made with respect

including  the SEC and the  NASD,  and  have  timely  paid in full  all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection  therewith other than such failures to
timely file or pay that would not  reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material  Adverse Effect.  Each of the Company and its  Subsidiaries is, and has
been since the later of its inception and January 1, 1995, duly registered as an
investment  adviser  under  the  Advisers  Act and under  all  applicable  state

Funds),  as of their  respective  dates or as of such other dates as so required
under  Applicable  Law,  contained  any untrue  statement of a material  fact or
omitted to state a material fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in
order to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.  The Company has previously delivered to Buyer a
true, correct and complete copy of each such Regulatory  Document filed with the
SEC by the Company,  its Subsidiaries and the Non-Registered Funds after January

Company (the  statements  referred to in this  sentence  (including  the balance
sheets), the "Audited Company Financial  Statements" and the balance sheet as of

Company and its  Subsidiaries  as of the date thereof,  and the other  financial
statements referred to in this Section 2.7 (including the related notes thereto,
where  applicable)  present  fairly in all material  respects the results of the

all material respects with GAAP with respect thereto (except, in the case of the
Audited  Financial  Statements,  as indicated in the related notes thereto,  and

(except,  in the case of the Audited Financial  Statements,  as indicated in the
related  notes  thereto,  and  except,  in the case of the  Unaudited  Financial
Statements,  that there are no notes thereto).  Except for (i) those liabilities
that are fully  reflected  or reserved  against on the Audited  Company  Balance
Sheet or  disclosed  in the notes  related  thereto  or (ii)  those  liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice since
the date of the  Audited  Company  Balance  Sheet and  which  are not  material,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  the  Company  does not  have  any  material
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether absolute,  accrued, contingent
or other and  whether  due or to become  due,  which are of a type that would be
required  to be shown on an audited  balance  sheet (or  described  in the notes
thereto)  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in this Agreement,  no  representation  is made as to the amount of the
accrual for  liabilities  under the EAP or the Amended and  Restated  EAP (which
obligations  shall have been  assumed by the  Members  immediately  prior to the
Closing)  on any of the  financial  statements  of the  Company,  including  any
financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.22.

          Section 2.16. Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.
                        -----------------------------
          (a) Schedule 2.16 of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule includes a list
of all compensation,  incentive,  deferred  compensation,  capital appreciation,
pension,  profit sharing and retirement  plans, and all life or other welfare or
employee  benefit  insurance,   incentive  compensation,   option,   employment,
severance  or  termination   pay,   hospitalization   or  other  medical  plans,
arrangements or agreements,  bonus and other employee benefit, welfare or fringe
benefit plans in each case in effect as of the date hereof with respect to which
contributions, premiums or other payments are made or required to be made by the
Company or its  Subsidiaries  with respect to their current or former  employees
(the "Plans").  Section 2.16 of the Company Disclosure  Schedule identifies each
Plan as either (i) a Plan  maintained by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
(a "Company Plan") or (ii) a Plan  maintained by Parent (a "Parent  Plan"),  but
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a participating  employer,
each of which Parent Plan shall cease to apply to the Company or any  Subsidiary
as of and after the Closing Date.

          (b) With respect to each Company  Plan,  the Company has  delivered to
Buyer a true,  correct and complete copy of each writing  constituting a part of
such  Company  Plan,   including  without  limitation  all  plan  documents  and
amendments thereto, benefit schedules, trust agreements, insurance contracts and
other funding vehicles, the most recent Form 5500 and accompanying schedules, if
any,  the  current  summary  plan  description  and any  material  modifications
thereto,  if any, the most recent financial and actuarial  reports,  if any, and
the most recent determination letter from the IRS.

          (c) The IRS has issued a favorable  determination  letter with respect
to each  Company  Plan that is  intended  to be a  "qualified  plan"  within the
meaning  of Section  401(a) of the Code  ("Qualified  Plans")  that has not been
revoked.  Each trust created under any such Company Plan is exempt under Section
501(a) of the Code.  To the  Knowledge  of the  Symphony  Parties,  there are no
existing circumstances nor any events that have occurred nor any amendments to a
Qualified Plan that have been adopted that could affect  adversely the qualified
status of any Qualified  Plan or the related  trust.  No Company Plan that is an
employee  pension  benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA and subject
to Title IV of ERISA,  has as of its last  valuation date any amount of unfunded
benefit  liabilities,  as  defined  in  Section  4001(a)(18),  calculated  using
actuarial assumptions and methods that have been furnished to Buyer.

          (d) Each Company Plan is in compliance  in all material  respects with
all  Applicable  Laws,  including  ERISA and the Code, and each Company Plan has
been  administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. To the
Knowledge of the Symphony  Parties,  there is not now, nor do any  circumstances
exist, that could give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with
respect  to a Company  Plan or the  imposition  of any lien on the assets of the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  under ERISA or the Code. No Company Plan is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section  302 of ERISA or Section  412 or 4971 of
the Code. No Company Plan is a  multiemployer  plan (as defined in Section 3(37)
of  ERISA).  Each  Company  Plan that is a "group  health  plan" (as  defined in
Section 607(l) of ERISA and Section  5000(b)(1) of the Code) has complied in all
material  respects with the  requirements  of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA  and  of   Section   4980B  of  the  Code.   No  Company   Plan   provides
post-termination welfare benefits other than as required by law.

premiums due or payable with respect to insurance  policies  funding any Company
Plan,  for any period  through  the date hereof have been timely made or paid in
full to the extent  required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof or,
to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the Audited Company Financial Statements.

execution  and  delivery  of  this  Agreement  nor  the   consummation   of  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby will result in, cause the accelerated vesting
or delivery  of, or  increase  the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to
any  employee of the  Company or the  funding of any such  benefit in a trust or
other  funding  vehicle  under a Company  Plan.  No amount  payable or  economic
benefit  provided  by  the  Company  or its  Subsidiaries  would  be an  "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

          (g) There are no pending claims (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course),  lawsuits,  investigations by any Governmental  Authority with
respect  to  which  notice  has  been  given  to any of  the  Symphony  Parties,
termination  proceedings or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted,
or to the Knowledge of the Symphony Parties  threatened or anticipated,  against
the Company  Plans which could  reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability  of the  Company to the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation,  the
Department of Treasury,  the Department of Labor or any Company Plan participant
or beneficiary.

          (h)  Since  March  31,  2001  neither  the  Company  nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  have increased the compensation or benefits provided pursuant to a
Company Plan in any material respect.

          (i) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries  nor, to the Knowledge of
the Symphony Parties, any other Person,  including any fiduciary, has engaged in
any "prohibited  transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which could subject any Company Plan or their related trusts, the
Company,  any of its  Subsidiaries  or any Person that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify with respect to such transaction, to
any material Tax or penalty  imposed  under  Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA.

Membership Interests is based in part on the answers to such questions as Buyer
and its representatives have raised concerning the transactions contemplated by

shall (i) use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and
approvals necessary to be obtained by the Company, any of its Affiliates or the
Funds, in order for the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated in

granted if such Client continues to accept such advisory services for a period
of at least 30 days after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice without
termination (provided, that such Client shall not have affirmatively stated to
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent or the Company that it does not so consent or
terminated its respective Non-Investment Company Advisory Agreement prior to the
Closing; provided further that consents to the assignment of any Non-Investment
Company Advisory Agreement with SAMI shall be deemed to have been given for
purposes hereunder only if such consent also includes the consent to the
assignment of such agreement from SAMI to the Company) (the "Negative Consent
Procedure"). Buyer shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review all such
consent materials to be used by the Company prior to distribution, and such

            Section 5.5. Section 15 of the Investment Company Act: Buyer's
                         -------------------------------------------------
Covenants. Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to assure
----------
compliance with the conditions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act
with respect to the Funds. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees that:
(a) for a period of not less than three years after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assure that no more than 25% of
the members of any Fund Board shall be "interested persons" (as such term is
defined for purposes of Section 15(f)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) of
Buyer (or such other entity which is an Affiliate of Buyer which acts as adviser
or subadviser to the Funds); and (b) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates,
for a period of not less than two years after the Closing Date, shall have any
express or implied understanding, arrangement or intention to impose an "unfair
burden" (as such term is used in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) on
any of the Funds as a result of the transactions contemplated herein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

contained herein, the covenants of Buyer contained in this Section 5.5 are
intended only for the benefit of the parties hereto.

            Section 5.6. Employees, Employee Benefits.
                         -----------------------------

            (a) General. From and after the Closing Date, unless otherwise
                -------
specifically set forth in this Section 5.6, the employees who are actively
employed by the Company (and who are not receiving short-term or long-term
disability benefits under a Plan) on the Closing Date (the "Company Employees")
shall participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Plans"). Buyer shall provide the Company Employees with service credit under any
such Buyer Plans for purposes of eligibility, vesting, waiting periods or other
qualification or eligibility for any benefit or privilege, but not for benefit
accrual purposes under any Buyer pension plan that Company Employees may, in the
future, be eligible to participate in. Effective as of the Closing, Parent and
the Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to cause (i) all
Company Employees to cease active participation in all Plans (including, but not
limited to, all employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements which such
Company Employees participated in, or which were maintained for the benefit of
Company Employees prior to the Closing by either the Company or Parent), and
(ii) the Company to cease to be a participating and contributing employer in the
Plans, such that the Company has no obligation, responsibility or liability
under such Plans, or to the Company Employees or any other individuals (whether
or not former employees of the Company) with respect to such Plans. Parent shall
cause all Company Employees to be fully vested in their account balances and
accrued benefits under the Plans effective as of the Closing, whether or not
such cessation of participation results in a partial termination of any such
Plan. Buyer shall neither adopt, become a sponsoring employer of, nor have any
obligations, responsibility or liabilities under, the Plans, or to the Company
Employees or other individuals with respect to the Plans. Nothing herein express
or implied shall be construed to prevent Buyer, after the Closing, from
terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect at any time or from
time to time (i) Buyer's employment relationship with any employee, including
any Company Employee, (ii) the terms and conditions of the employment of any
employee, including the Company Employees, including, but not limited to, wages
and/or salaries, hours and employee benefits, or (iii) any of the Buyer's
"employee benefit plans" as defined under ERISA or similar or other plans,
programs or arrangements, and nothing in this Section 5.6 shall be construed to
provide a contract of employment, or to provide any other promise of future
employment, to the Company Employees.

            (b) Medical, Dental and Healthcare Reimbursement Benefits. For the
                -----------------------------------------------------
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the last calendar day of the
month in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall continue the coverage for the
Company Employees under Parent's medical, dental and healthcare reimbursement
plans existing on the Closing Date. No later than the last calendar day of the
month in which the Closing occurs, the Company Employees and their eligible
dependents shall be eligible to participate in medical, dental and healthcare
reimbursement plans either maintained by Buyer or which Buyer causes the Company
to maintain on or after the Closing to the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Buyer. Buyer shall cause such plans to waive any pre-existing
condition exclusions thereunder with respect to the Company Employees and their
eligible dependents and shall provide Company Employees and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, offsets (or


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

similar payments) prior to their participation in such plans for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements
under any Buyer or Company plans in which Company Employees or their eligible
dependents are eligible to participate after the Closing. All liabilities
relating to, arising out of, or resulting from medical, dental and healthcare
claims incurred by or on behalf of any employee, independent contractor or
consultant of the Company or any of their covered dependents prior to the
Closing Date under any medical, dental or healthcare Parent Plan maintained by
Parent shall remain liabilities of such Parent Plan following the Closing Date.
A claim for medical, dental and healthcare benefits shall be deemed to be
"incurred" upon the rendering of such medical, dental or healthcare services
giving rise to the obligation to pay such benefits regardless of when such claim
is in fact submitted for payment.

            (c) Short-Term and Long-Term Disability. From and after the Closing
                -----------------------------------
Date, the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyer's
Short-Term and Long-Term disability plans applicable to similarly situated
employees of Buyer. Any person who is (i) an employee of the Company as of the
Closing Date and who is, at such time, receiving short-term or long-term
disability benefits under a Plan, or (ii) a former employee or other individual
receiving short-term or long-term disability benefits under a Plan on the
Closing Date, shall continue to be covered by such Plan from and after the
Closing Date and Parent and Maestro shall retain all liabilities with respect to
such Persons. In the event that an individual described in clause (i) above
returns to active service with the Company after the Closing Date, such
individual shall be deemed to be a "Company Employee" for purposes of this
Section 5.6 from and after the date such individual returns to the active
employment with the Company.

            (d) Life Insurance. The Company Employees shall be eligible to
                --------------
participate in Buyer's life insurance policies applicable to similarly situated
employees of Buyer from and after the Closing Date. Parent shall require that
the individuals described in Section 5.6(c)(i) are approved for the "waiver of
premium" provisions applicable to such individuals prior to such person's return
to active service with the Company.

            (e) Pension Plan and 401(k) Plan Distributions. The Company
                ------------------------------------------
Employees shall not be eligible to participate in Buyer's defined benefit
pension plan. The Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyer's
401(k) plan from and after the Closing Date. In the event that the Company
Employees are provided with the opportunity to elect eligible rollover
distributions from their account balances under Parent's 401(k) Plan (i.e., the
Plan in which they participate as of the date of this Agreement), Buyer's 401(k)
plan shall accept such rollovers from such electing Company Employees into their
accounts under the Buyer's 401(k) plan.

            (f) Tuition Reimbursement. During the period commencing on the
                ---------------------
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2001 (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer
shall provide the Company Employees with participation in a tuition
reimbursement plan substantially identical to the tuition reimbursement plan
applicable to such Company Employees as of the date of this Agreement and the
Company Employees shall not be eligible to participate in any alternative
tuition reimbursement plan that may be provided by Buyer to its employees during
such period.


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

            (g) Other Benefits. During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall
                --------------
provide the Company Employees with benefits under a (x) public transportation
policy, (y) gym membership policy and (z) employee referral policy substantially
identical to the public transportation, gym membership and employee referral
policies applicable to such employees as of the date of this Agreement, and the
Company Employees shall not be eligible to receive benefits under similar
policies (if any) that may be provided by Buyer to its employees during such
period.

            Section 5.7. Further Assurances.
                         -------------------

            (a) Each party to this Agreement shall execute such documents and
other papers and perform such further acts as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon
the request of Buyer, the Symphony Parties and their respective controlled
Affiliates shall promptly execute and deliver such further instruments of
assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization and
other documents as Buyer may reasonably request to effectuate the purposes of
this Agreement.

            (b) In the event that at any time or from time to time after the
Closing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive or otherwise possess any
SAMI Asset Omission or Parent Asset Omission, Parent shall promptly transfer, or
cause to be transferred, such SAMI Asset Omission or Parent Asset Omission, as
the case may be, to the Company. Prior to any such transfer, Parent (or its
Subsidiaries) possessing such SAMI Asset Omission or Parent Asset Omission, as
the case may be, shall hold such SAMI Asset Omission or Parent Asset Omission,
as the case may be, (and all earnings generated by such asset from and after the
Closing) in trust for the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if a SAMI Asset Omission or Parent Asset Omission covered by this
Section 5.7(b) is discovered following the Closing, the Symphony Parties shall
be deemed not to be in breach of Section 2.23, provided that the terms of the
first sentence of this Section 5.7(b) are complied with as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

            Section 5.8. Efforts of Parties to Close. Subject to the provisions
                         ----------------------------
of Section 5.11, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Closing Date, each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the execution
and delivery of any documents, certificates, instruments or other papers that
are reasonably required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing through
the Closing, except as required by Applicable Law or with the prior written
consent of Buyer, in the case of any of the Symphony Parties, or Parent and
Maestro, in the case of Buyer, no party to this Agreement shall knowingly take
any action which, or knowingly fail to take any action the failure of which to
be taken, would, or could reasonably be expected to: (a) result in any of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
party taking or failing to take such action being or becoming untrue in any
material respect; (b) result in any conditions to the Closing set forth in
Article VI not being satisfied; or (c) result in a material violation of any
provision of this Agreement.

            Section 5.9. Confidentiality and Announcements.
                       ------------------------------------

            (a) The parties agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreements, the provisions of which
Confidentiality Agreements are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, Buyer's obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate with respect to information to the
extent relating solely to the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Non-Registered
Funds and the Funds and the parties' obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreements shall terminate with respect to disclosure relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that Buyer's obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreements with respect to information obtained from
and/or regarding Parent shall survive the Closing.

            (b) From and after the Closing, each of Parent, the Members and the
Company Principals shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and its and
their officers, directors, employees and advisors to, keep confidential and not
use for its benefit or for the benefit of any other Person, any and all
non-public information relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries, its Clients,
the Non-Registered Funds and the Funds; provided, however, that Parent, the
Members and/or the Company Principals, as the case may be, shall not be liable
hereunder with respect to any disclosure to the extent such disclosure is (i)
compelled by legal process (by interrogatories, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or similar process) or (ii) required, based upon the written advice of
counsel, pursuant to the requirements of any Applicable Law (including without
limitation the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or any rule or regulation promulgated under either Act or
any national stock exchange). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such non-public
information shall not include information that (i) is or becomes part of the
public domain through no fault of Parent, the Members or the Company Principals
(provided that information shall not be deemed to be within such exclusion
merely because it is embraced by general disclosures in the public domain); (ii)
is lawfully disclosed to Parent, the Members or the Company Principals by a
third party not bound by an obligation of confidentiality; or (iii) is
independently developed by Parent, the Members or the Company Principals without
reference to or the use of such non-public information.

            (c) Subject to Section 5.11(a) and (b), the parties to this
Agreement shall consult with each other as to the form, substance and timing of
any press release or other public disclosure related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and no such press release or other public
disclosure shall be made without the consent of the other parties, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the
parties may make such disclosure to the extent (i) such disclosure is compelled
by legal process (by interrogatories, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process) or (ii) such disclosure is required, based upon the written
advice of counsel, pursuant to the requirements of any Applicable Law (including
without limitation the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any rule or
regulation promulgated by any national stock exchange); provided, however, that
following the execution of this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that
Parent and Buyer each shall be permitted to file with the SEC a Current Report
on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act in order to disclose the execution of this
Agreement, which Form may include a copy of this Agreement (other than the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits


                                      -51-
<PAGE>

to this Agreement) as an exhibit to such Form 8-K, without the prior consent of
any of the other parties hereto.

            Section 5.10. Access; Certain Communications. Between the date of
                          ------------------------------
this Agreement and the Closing Date, subject to Applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company shall afford to Buyer and its authorized
agents and representatives access, upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours, to all properties of, and all contracts, documents and
information of or relating to the assets, liabilities, business, customers,
Funds, Clients, employees, operations, personnel and other aspects of the
business of, the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such
access shall be coordinated by the Company and shall be conducted in a manner
which does not unreasonably interfere with the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
normal operations, customers, and employee relations.

            Section 5.11. Regulatory Matters; Third-Party Consents.
                        -------------------------------------------

            (a) The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate with each other
and use their commercially reasonable efforts promptly to prepare and file (on a
confidential basis if reasonably requested by the other parties) all necessary
documentation, to effect (on a confidential basis if reasonably requested by the
other parties) all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain
as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any filing to be made under the HSR Act, which filings
shall be made as promptly as reasonably practicable, and requests for required
consents under the Contracts. Buyer and the Symphony Parties agree to take all
reasonable steps necessary to satisfy any conditions or requirements imposed by
any Governmental Authority in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than those conditions or
requirements, in the aggregate, the satisfaction of which are reasonably likely
to result in either a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. Each party to this Agreement will have the right to review in
advance, and will consult with the other parties with respect to, all the
information relating to Buyer or the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
Non-Registered Funds, as the case may be, which appear in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any confidential filing of the
Symphony Parties, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Non-Registered
Funds or Buyer or any of Buyer's Subsidiaries made in the ordinary course of
business. The parties to this Agreement agree that they will consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and

Agreement in a manner which would alter the rights of indemnification existing
in favor of the directors and officers of the Company as provided in the Company
Operating Agreement in effect on the date hereof with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that no indemnity shall
be available in respect of any Losses as to which any Buyer Indemnitee is

which such director or officer would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 5.15(a), which insurance shall, subject to the provisos to this Section
5.15(b), contain at least the same coverage amounts as, and shall contain terms
and conditions no less advantageous than, insurance coverage currently provided
by the Company; provided that Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall
not be obligated to make a premium payment per year in respect of such policy
(or replacement policy) which exceeds, for the Company's officers and directors,
150% of the annual premium payment under the Company's current policy in effect
on the date of this Agreement, which annual premium payment the Company
represents and

NetNet Ventures representing, at the time of withdrawal, in excess of 120% of
the original Minimum Investment and shall be obligated to invest additional
amounts in Company Products and NetNet Ventures to maintain at least 80% of the
original amount of the Minimum Investment invested in Company Products at all
times during such period.

----------

            (a) Buyer and each of the Symphony Parties agree that the
information or data relating to such party and its Subsidiaries that was
provided by or on behalf of such party specifically for inclusion in the proxy
materials to be furnished to shareholders of the Funds for the purpose of
approving new Investment Company Advisory Agreements with the Company to take
effect immediately after the Closing will not contain, at the time the proxy

any material fact required to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

            (b) Buyer and each of the Symphony Parties agree that none of the
information regarding such party or any of its Affiliates supplied or to be

            (a) Parent understands that, in connection with the purchase of the
Membership Interests by Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to protect and preserve
the going concern value of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the extent provided herein and that Buyer would not have entered into this
Agreement absent the provisions of this Section 5.20 and, therefore, agrees as
follows:

              (i) from and after the Closing Date until the earlier of (i) 18
    months from the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which SAMI is no longer
    entitled to any Contingent Purchase Consideration with respect to periods
    following such date, Parent shall not, and Parent shall not permit any of
    its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to offer or provide in the United
    States of America or in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or its
    Subsidiaries transacts business as of the Closing Date any long-only
    strategy or market neutral strategy asset management products or services
    that are substantially similar to those long-only strategy and market
    neutral strategy products and services provided as of the Closing by the
    Company or its Subsidiaries in the United States of America or such foreign
    jurisdictions (the "Competing Products"); provided, however, that the terms
    of this Section 5.20(a)(i) shall not apply to (A) any business engaged in or
    operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than SAMI, the Company
    and its Subsidiaries) as of the date hereof to the extent operated
    substantially consistent with past practice; (B) any business or assets that
    are part of a larger acquisition of assets by Parent or its Subsidiaries,
    provided that Competing Products give rise to less than 25% of the revenues
    of such business or assets for the 12-month period immediately preceding the
    closing of such acquisition; and (C) any business or assets that are part of
    a larger acquisition of assets by Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
    agreement entered into at least six months following the Closing Date even
    if Competing Products give rise to 25% or more, but in no event greater than
    50%, of the revenues of such business or assets for the 12-month period
    immediately preceding the closing of such acquisition, provided, however,
    that Parent shall elect by delivery of written notice to Buyer on or prior
    to the closing date of such acquisition to either (i) divest itself of such
    business or assets as promptly as practicable following such closing (and in
    any event within nine months thereafter), in which case the obligations of
    Buyer to make payments to SAMI pursuant to Exhibit R shall be suspended upon
    the closing of such acquisition and no additional payments shall be made
    thereunder (other than with respect to any payments owing in respect of
    periods ending prior thereto), but all suspended amounts shall be paid to
    SAMI by Buyer upon completion of such divestiture if such divestiture is
    completed within such nine-month period but shall not otherwise be paid to
    SAMI or (ii) agree that the obligations of Buyer to make payments to SAMI
    pursuant to Exhibit R hereof shall be extinguished upon such acquisition
    other than with respect to any payments owing in respect of periods ending


                                      -56-
<PAGE>


    prior to the closing of such acquisition, and in the case of subclauses (i)
    and (ii) above, in no event shall there be any corresponding increase in
    amounts due to Maestro under Exhibit R hereof; and

              (ii) until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
    shall not, and Parent shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries, directly or
    indirectly, to solicit, encourage or induce any person employed as of the
    date hereof or as of the Closing Date by the Company or any of its
    Subsidiaries to leave the employment of the Company or any of its
    Subsidiaries; provided that it shall not be a violation of this Section
    5.2(a)(ii) to engage in general employment solicitation activities, such as
    newspaper advertisements, that are not directed specifically at employees of
    the Company or its Subsidiaries.

            (b) Maestro and the Company Principals understand that in connection
with the purchase of the Membership Interests by Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled
to protect and preserve the going concern value of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the extent provided in Section 5 of the Employment
Agreements and that Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement absent
entering into such Employment Agreements containing such provisions.

            (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is
understood and agreed that remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of
any breach of the covenants contained in this Section 5.20, and Buyer shall be
entitled to equitable relief in respect thereof, including the remedy of
specific performance, with respect to any breach of such covenants, without the
need to show any proof of damages.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the terms of this Section 5.20 shall cease to apply to Parent and to
each of its Subsidiaries upon the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of or equity interests in Parent to a Person that is not an Affiliate of Parent
or a merger or other business combination between Parent and a Person that is
not an Affiliate of Parent where the shareholders of Parent immediately prior to
the merger or business combination beneficially own less than 50% of the
surviving corporation immediately following such transaction if Parent so elects
and gives written notice to Buyer prior to consummation of such transaction of
such election; provided, however, that if such election is made, the obligations
of Buyer to make payments to SAMI pursuant to Exhibit R hereof shall be
extinguished upon such sale, merger or other business combination other than
with respect to any payments owing in respect of periods ending prior to the
consummation of such sale without any corresponding increase in amounts due to
Maestro. In the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of or
equity interests in any Subsidiary of Parent to a Person that is not an
Affiliate of Parent, the terms of this Section 5.20 shall cease to apply to such
Subsidiary if Parent so elects and gives written notice to Buyer prior to
consummation of such transaction of such election; provided, however, that if
such election is made, any sale of all or substantially all of the assets or
equity interests of a Subsidiary of Parent that requires the prior approval of
Parent's shareholders shall be deemed to be a sale of all or substantially all
of the assets of or equity interests in Parent and the proviso to the first
sentence of this Section 5.20(d) shall apply to terminate the obligations of
Buyer to make payments pursuant to Exhibit R as set forth in this Section
5.20(d).

capital gain, as defined by Section 1222(11) of the Code, an equal or exceeding
amount of capital gain dividend, as defined by Section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Code,
was distributed, or in the alternative, undistributed capital gains were treated
by the Fund in accordance with Section 852(b)(3)(D), for the appropriate
complete taxable year since the Fund's inception; (viii) to the extent that any
Fund earned interest excludable from gross income under Section 103(a) of the

year since its formation; and (ix) each Fund which is invested in by a separate
account of an insurance company is and has been managed in a way to ensure

transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1
C.B. 432 (Situation 2), unless Buyer assigns a portion of its rights and
obligations hereunder to a corporate Subsidiary of Buyer, in which case the
parties hereto shall treat the Transaction as a purchase and sale of partnership
interests for United States federal, state and local income Tax purposes. The
parties hereto acknowledge that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will cause a termination for federal Income Tax purposes
under Section 708(b) of the Code of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and
a corresponding closing of the taxable year of each such entity on the date of
such termination.

              Section 8.3. Tax Covenants.
                           --------------

            (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2 or 8.3(b), Buyer
shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file in accordance with all
Applicable Laws all Tax Returns of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Non-Registered Funds which are required to be filed after the Closing Date and
which are for a Straddle Period or a Post-Closing Period. As of the time of
filing, such Tax Returns will correctly reflect in all material respects the
facts regarding the income, business, assets, operations, activities and status
of the Company and any other information required to be shown therein. At least
30 days (taking into account any available validly obtained extension) prior to
the due date for filing each of such Tax Returns with respect to any Straddle
Period, Buyer shall furnish the Members with a copy of such draft Tax Return. If
the parties cannot reach an agreement with respect to any such furnished Tax
Return within 20 days of the due date for filing such Tax Return, the
disagreement shall be referred (within a reasonable time, taking into account
the deadline for filing such Tax Return) to the Independent Accounting Firm for
the resolution. The resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final
and binding on both parties without any further adjustment. The draft Tax Return
shall be revised to reflect the resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm,
and, once revised, shall be


                                      -64-
<PAGE>

final and binding on both parties without any further adjustment, unless
subsequently adjusted by the appropriate taxing authority. The costs, expenses
and fees of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the
Members and Buyer. Once such Straddle Period Tax Return is final, Buyer shall
(or shall cause the Company to) timely file such Tax Returns with the
appropriate taxing authority. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the
appropriate Tax authority any Taxes due in accordance with any Tax Return if
filed pursuant to this Section 8.3(a), and the Members shall pay to Buyer their
share of such Taxes (determined pursuant to Section 8.5) at least five Business
Days prior to the filing of such Tax Return. If Buyer files an IRS Form 1065 for
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the taxable year beginning the day
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause an election under Section 754 of the
Code to be filed with each such IRS Form 1065.

            (b) The Symphony Parties shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in
consultation with the Buyer, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
which are required or permitted to be filed with respect to the short taxable
years ended on the Closing Date and all other Tax Returns of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Non-Registered Funds which are required to be filed with
respect to any taxable year ended prior to the Closing Date in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Company. Prior to the Closing, the Members
and Buyer shall jointly prepare, and the Members shall sign, an election under
Section 754 of the Code with respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
for the taxable year of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that includes
the Closing Date. The Members shall cause such elections to be filed with the
IRS Forms 1065 for the Company and its Subsidiaries for the short taxable year
ending on the Closing Date and shall not seek to revoke such election.

            (c) Buyer and the Symphony Parties agree to cause the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Non-Registered Funds to file all Tax Returns for the period
including the Closing Date on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, unless the relevant taxing
authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis.

            Section 8.4. Tax Refunds; Amendment of Returns. Any refund or credit
                         ----------------------------------
received by Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Non-Registered Funds for a
Pre-Closing Period not taken into account in the Adjustment Amount shall be
allocated to the Members, and shall promptly be paid to the Members. Neither
Buyer nor the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the Non-Registered
Funds shall (i) amend or cause the amendment of any Tax Return of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Non-Registered Funds with respect to any
Pre-Closing Period or (ii) agree to an extension of the statute of limitations
applicable to such Tax Return, in either case without prior written consent of
the Members, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            Section 8.5. Tax Indemnification.
                         --------------------

            (a) Subject to Section 9.4(c), Parent, the Members and the Company
Principals shall be jointly and severally liable for, and shall indemnify Buyer
and its Affiliates (including after the Closing the Company, its Subsidiaries
and the Non-Registered Funds) and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, agents and representatives and hold them harmless from,
their respective Allocable Share of (i) all liability for Taxes of the


                                      -65-
<PAGE>

Company, its Subsidiaries and the Non-Registered Funds for the Pre-Closing
Period (including all liability for Taxes of other Persons as a result of
Treasury Regulation ss.1.1502-6(a) or comparable provisions under state, local
or foreign law) which are not taken into account in the Adjustment Amount (other
than Taxes resulting from an action taken by Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary
of Buyer or any Non-Registered Fund on the Closing Date but after the Closing
that is outside of the ordinary course of business), (ii) any Losses resulting
from any breach of any representation or warranty of the Symphony Parties in
Section 8.1 (without giving effect to any qualifications relating to
materiality), (iii) any Losses resulting from any breach of any covenant of the
Symphony Parties relating to Taxes contained in this Agreement and (iv) all
liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item in
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, it is understood and agreed that in no event shall Parent and
SAMI, on the one hand, or Maestro and the Company Principals, on the other hand,
be liable for the other's Allocable Share of any such Losses.

            (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, indemnify Parent, the Members, their respective Subsidiaries and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives and hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Non-Registered Funds for any Post-Closing
Period (and for Taxes resulting from an action taken by Buyer, the Company, any
of their Subsidiaries or any Non-Registered Fund on the Closing Date but after
the Closing that is outside of the ordinary course of business), (ii) any Losses
resulting from any breach of any covenant of Buyer relating to Taxes contained
in this Agreement and (iii) all liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses
attributable to any item in clause (i) or (ii) above.

            (c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"):

              (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes of the Company,
    its Subsidiaries and the Non-Registered Funds for the Pre-Closing Period
    included in the Straddle Period shall be equal to the amount of such
    property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
    numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are
    in a Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of days
    in the Straddle Period; and

              (ii) the Taxes of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
    Non-Registered Funds (other than real, personal and intangible property
    Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Period included in the Straddle Period shall be
    computed as if such taxable period (and the taxable period of any entity
    taxable as a partnership in which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
    any of the Non-Registered Funds directly or indirectly owns an ownership
    interest) ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

            (d) The obligation to indemnify and hold harmless a party pursuant
to this Section 8.5 shall terminate at the time the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in question expires (giving
effect to any extensions thereof); provided, however, that such obligation shall
not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified
or the related party thereto shall have, before the expiration of the applicable
period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim to the
indemnifying party.


                                      -66-

(e) The principles of Section 9.4(a) shall apply to any indemnity payment under
this Section 8.5.

                         --------------------------
Date, the Symphony Parties and Buyer shall:

              (i) assist in all reasonable respects (and use commercially
    reasonably efforts to cause their respective Subsidiaries to assist) the
    other party in preparing any Tax Returns of the Company which such other
    party is responsible for preparing and filing;

              (ii) cooperate in all reasonable respects in preparing for any
    audits of, or disputes with Tax authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of

    Affiliate of the Company;

              (iii) make available to the other parties and to any Tax
    authority, in each case as reasonably requested by such other parties, all
    information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the Company and/or
    any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of the Non-Registered Funds;

              (iv) provide timely notice to the other parties in writing of any
    pending or threatened tax audits or assessments of the Company and/or any of
    its Subsidiaries and/or any of the Non-Registered Funds for taxable periods
    for which those other parties may have a liability under Article VIII; and

              (v) furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence
    received from any Taxing authority in connection with any tax audit or
    information request with respect to the Company and/or any of its
    Subsidiaries and/or any of the Non-Registered Funds with respect to any
    taxable period described in Section 8.6(d)(iv).

                         --------------------------------

            (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the
Members shall, in consultation with Buyer, control, manage and be responsible
for any audit, contest, claim, proceeding or inquiry with respect to Taxes for
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and shall have the
right, in consultation with Buyer, to settle or contest any such audit, contest,
claim, proceeding or inquiry; provided, however, that if any such settlement
would materially and adversely impact a Tax Return or Tax position of any of the
Company, Buyer or their Affiliates with respect to a Post-Closing Period, the
Buyer and the Members shall mutually agree on the terms of such settlement.

            (b) Buyer shall, in consultation with the Members, control, manage
and be responsible for any audit, contest, claim, proceeding or inquiry with
respect to Taxes for any Straddle Period and shall have the right, in

the Contingent Purchase Consideration will be allocated entirely to goodwill,
except to the extent of any value allocated to contracts and other arrangements

Initial Purchase Consideration to the extent payable under this Agreement) and

hereto to any portion of the consideration provided for hereunder or to any
other amounts based thereon, including under the EAP or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is understood and
agreed that in no event shall Parent and SAMI, on the one hand, or Maestro and
the Company Principals, on the other hand, be liable for the other's Allocable
Share of any Losses. "Allocable Share" shall mean, as to each of the Parent, the
Members and the Company Principals, the percentage set forth opposite their
respective names on Exhibit I hereto.

            (b) Parent, the Members and the Company Principals shall not be
required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee, and shall not have any liability
under Section 9.1(a)(i), unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Parent,
the Members and the Company Principals would, but for this Section 9.1(b), be
liable thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to the Members
Indemnity Threshold and then only to the extent of any such excess.

            Section 9.2. Additional Indemnification by Parent, the Members and
                         -----------------------------------------------------
the Company Principals. From and after the Closing, each of Parent, the Members
-----------------------
and the Company Principals shall be severally, and not jointly, liable for, and
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees against and hold them harmless from, any
Losses suffered or incurred by any such Buyer Indemnitee (other than any Loss
relating to Taxes, for which the indemnification provisions set forth in Section
8.5 shall govern) arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by such party in or
pursuant to Article III of this Agreement (it being agreed that solely for
purposes of establishing whether any matter is indemnifiable pursuant to this
Section 9.2, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the
Symphony Parties shall be determined without giving effect to any qualifications
relating to materiality (including Company Material Adverse Effect)) or any
covenant, agreement or undertaking to be complied with or performed by such
party pursuant to this Agreement.

            Section 9.3. Indemnification by Buyer.
                         -------------------------

            (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Parent, the
Members, their respective Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the "Symphony
Indemnitees"), against and hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or
incurred by such Symphony Indemnitee (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for
which the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 8.5 shall govern) to
the extent arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of (i) any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement (it being agreed that solely for purposes of establishing whether
any matter is indemnifiable pursuant to this clause (i), the accuracy of the
representations and warranties made by Buyer shall be determined without giving
effect to any qualifications relating to materiality (including Company Material
Adverse Effect)) or (ii) any breach, noncompliance or nonfulfillment by Buyer of
any covenant, agreement or undertaking to be complied with or performed by it
pursuant to this Agreement.

            (b) Buyer shall not be required to indemnify any Symphony
Indemnitee, and shall not have any liability under Section 9.3(a)(i), unless the
aggregate of all Losses for which


                                      -69-
<PAGE>

Buyer would, but for this Section 9.3(b), be liable thereunder exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to the Buyer Indemnity Threshold and then only
to the extent of any such excess.

            Section 9.4. Calculation and Payment of Losses.
                       ------------------------------------

            (a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided
under this Article IX or Section 8.5 shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such
Loss and shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost (other than
a reduction in Tax basis) incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the
receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii)
reduced to take account of any net Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss, in each case when and
as such Tax cost or Tax Benefit is actually realized through an increase or
reduction of Taxes otherwise due. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement
shall be treated first as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Consideration
and then as an adjustment to the Contingent Purchase Consideration for United
States federal income Tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall
include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to
either the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates causes any such payment
not to be treated as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Consideration or the
Contingent Purchase Consideration for United States Federal income Tax purposes.

            (b) Buyer shall be entitled to deduct from any amounts otherwise
payable to any Member pursuant to this Agreement the amount with respect to
which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnity under this Article IX or
under Article VIII from such Member, and such deducted amounts shall be deemed
paid to such Member for all purposes hereunder; provided, however, that Buyer
shall be permitted to make such deduction only to the extent that (i) the
parties have agreed in writing, (ii) an award was rendered pursuant to Section
9.8 or (iii) a final and non-appealable judgment was entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

            (c) The aggregate indemnification obligations of Parent and SAMI
pursuant to this Article IX and Section 8.5, collectively, shall not exceed the
Parent Indemnity Cap, and the aggregate indemnification obligations of Maestro
and the Company Principals pursuant to this Article IX and Section 8.5,
collectively, shall not exceed the Maestro Indemnity Cap; provided, that such
limitation shall not apply to the extent that a Loss results directly from (i)
common law fraud, (ii) any Income Tax liability of any of the Symphony Parties
relating to the Pre-Closing Period or (iii) a claim described in Section
9.1(a)(iii) (each of (i), (ii) and (iii), a "Buyer Indemnitee Limitation
Exception").

            (d) The indemnification obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 9.3
shall not exceed the Buyer Indemnity Cap; provided that such limitation shall
not apply to the extent that a Loss results directly from (i) common law fraud,
(ii) any Income Tax liability of any of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Non-Registered Funds for the Post-Closing Period or (iii) a breach of Buyer's
payment obligations under Sections 1.3 through 1.8 of this Agreement (each of
(i), (ii) and (iii), a "Symphony Party Indemnitee Limitation Exception").

            (e) On or prior to the Closing, Buyer, the Company and each of the
Company Principals shall execute and deliver a pledge agreement in the form
attached as Exhibit N and


                                      -70-
<PAGE>

each of the Company Principals shall take all other actions reasonably requested
by Buyer to pledge as of the Closing their respective Minimum Investments as
security for their respective obligations under Article VIII and this Article
IX.

            Section 9.5. Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to
                         -------------------------------
indemnify and hold harmless any Person pursuant to Sections 9.1(a), 9.2 and
9.3(a) shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to Section 10.3; provided that such obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to
which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the
applicable period, previously made a bona fide claim by delivering a notice of
such claim pursuant to Section 9.6 to the indemnifying party; provided, further,
that in the event of a Buyer Indemnitee Limitation Exception or a Symphony Party
Indemnitee Limitation Exception, the obligation to indemnify shall continue
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

            Section 9.6. Procedures.
                         -----------

            (a) Third Party Claims. In order for a Person (the "Indemnified
                ------------------
Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 9.1,
9.2 or 9.3 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any Person
against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party
must notify the indemnifying party in writing of the Third Party Claim promptly
following receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party, as promptly as practicable following the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim that are not
separately addressed to the indemnifying party.

            (b) Assumption. If a Third Party Claim is made against an
                ----------
Indemnified Party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the indemnifying party; provided, however, that such counsel
is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. Should the indemnifying
party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any reasonable legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense; provided that the indemnifying party shall bear the
reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) if the parties to any
such action or proceeding (including impleaded parties) include any of the
Symphony Parties (other than the Company) and representation of both parties
would, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party, be
inappropriate due to a conflict of interest or (ii) if the indemnifying party
shall not have employed counsel (other than counsel that is reasonably objected
to by the Indemnified Party) within a reasonable time after the Indemnified
Party has given notice of the institution of a Third Party Claim in compliance
with Section 9.6(a). The indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses


                                      -71-
<PAGE>

of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof, provided that such
counsel is not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party. If the
indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the
Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's
request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the indemnifying party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying
party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to
pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim,
which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third
Party Claim and that would not otherwise materially adversely affect the
Indemnified Party.

            (c) Other Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a
                ------------
claim against any indemnifying party under Section 9.1, 9.2 or 9.3 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such
claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. Subject to Sections
9.5 and 10.3, the failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may
have to such Indemnified Party under Section 9.1, 9.2 or 9.3, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced by such
failure.

            Section 9.7. Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge
                         -----------------
and agree that, from and after the Closing except in the case of common law
fraud or with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific performance,
injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies (other than
declaratory judgment actions) are available, the sole and exclusive remedy of
the parties hereto with respect to any and all monetary claims arising from any
breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein (other than in Section
8.1) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article IX, and the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect
to any and all monetary claims with respect to any breach of any representation
or warranty set forth in Section 8.1, any breach of any covenant relating to
Taxes contained in this Agreement, or any Taxes shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of Section 8.5.

            Section 9.8. Binding Arbitration.
                         --------------------

            (a) Buyer and each of the Symphony Parties hereby waives its right
to resolve any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements arising
under this Article IX or Section 8.5 hereof with respect to Losses ("Claims")
through any court proceeding or litigation (subject only to the right of the
Person seeking indemnification under this Article IX or Section 8.5 hereof to
elect to bring Claims in any court of competent jurisdiction, including Claims
for incidental, special or consequential damages and Claims for specific
performance or injunctive


                                      -72-
<PAGE>

relief or for common law fraud, other than any Claims the underlying subject
matter of which previously or at such time are the subject of arbitration
hereunder) and acknowledge that all Claims shall be resolved pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 9.8. Each of the parties hereto represents to the
others that this waiver is required to be made, is made knowingly and
voluntarily after consultation with and upon the advice of counsel and is a
material part of this Agreement.

            (b) Buyer or any of the Symphony Parties may demand in writing (a
"Demand") that the parties meet to resolve any Claim, and such meeting shall
take place at such time and such place as the parties shall agree, but in no
event later than 30 days after receipt of a Demand. If any Claim is not resolved
within 45 days of the receipt of a Demand, the party making such Demand may
initiate arbitration pursuant to this Section 9.8. Such arbitration shall be
mandatory and binding. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.8, the
arbitration shall be pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association then in effect, as modified herein (the
"Rules").

            (c) All Claims shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators
(the "Arbitration Panel") of whom Buyers shall appoint one and the Symphony
Parties (other than the Company) shall appoint one within 15 days of the receipt
by the respondent(s) of the demand for arbitration. The two arbitrators so
appointed shall select the chair of the arbitral tribunal within 15 days of the
appointment of the second arbitrator. If any arbitrator is not appointed within
the time limits provided herein, such arbitrator shall be appointed by the
American Arbitration Association by using a list striking and ranking procedure
in accordance with the Rules. Any arbitrator appointed by the American
Arbitration Association shall be a retired judge or a practicing attorney with
no less than 15 years of experience and an experienced arbitrator.

            (d) The arbitration hearing shall be held and the award shall be
rendered in New York City or such other location as the parties may mutually
agree. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, partial or full summary judgment
shall not be available. In the event summary judgment or partial summary
judgment is available as provided herein and is granted, the non-prevailing
party may not raise as a basis for a motion to vacate an award that the
Arbitration Panel failed or refused to consider evidence bearing on the
dismissed claim(s) or issue(s). The party bringing a particular claim or
asserting an affirmative defense will have the burden of proof with respect
thereto. The arbitration proceedings and all testimony, filings, documents and
information relating to or presented during the arbitration proceedings shall be
deemed to be information subject to the confidentiality provisions of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements. The arbitrators shall follow the
law designated by the parties hereto. The Arbitration Panel will have no power
or authority, under the Rules or otherwise, to relieve the parties from their
agreement hereunder to arbitrate or otherwise to amend or disregard any
provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of
this Section 9.8. The arbitral tribunal is not empowered to award incidental,
special or consequential damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall create an inference that
incidental, special or consequential damages are or are not appropriate with
respect to any Claim that is brought in any forum other than the arbitral
tribunal provided for by this Section 9.8.


                                      -73-
<PAGE>

            (e) Should an arbitrator refuse or be unable to proceed with
arbitration proceedings as called for by this Section 9.8, the arbitrator shall
be replaced pursuant to the Rules. If an arbitrator is replaced after the
arbitration hearing has commenced, then a rehearing shall take place in
accordance with this Section 9.8 and the Rules.

            (f) At the time of granting or denying a motion of summary judgment
as provided for in Section 9.8(d) and within 30 days after the closing of the
arbitration hearing, the Arbitration Panel will prepare and distribute to the
parties a writing setting forth the Arbitration Panel's finding of facts and
conclusions of law relating to the Claim, including the reasons for the giving
or denial of any award. The findings of fact and conclusions of law and the
award, if any, shall be deemed to be information subject to the confidentiality
provisions of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements.

            (g) The Arbitration Panel is instructed to schedule promptly all
discovery and other procedural steps and otherwise to assume case management
initiative and control to effect an efficient and expeditious resolution of the
Claim. The Arbitration Panel is authorized to issue monetary sanctions against
either party if, upon an evidentiary showing such party is found to be
unreasonably delaying the proceeding.

            (h) Any award rendered by the Arbitration Panel will be final,
conclusive and binding upon the parties and any judgment thereon may be entered
and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

            (i) The prevailing party in any proceeding hereunder shall be
entitled, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled, to
recover from the other party or parties reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
such prevailing party's attorneys, experts and witnesses incurred in connection
with such proceedings and the other party or parties shall bear the costs and
expenses of the Arbitration Panel.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            Section 10.1. Amendments; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended,
                          -------------------
altered or modified except by written instrument executed by Buyer, Parent, SAMI
and Maestro. Any agreement on the part of Buyer, Parent, SAMI and Maestro to
waive (i) any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein by any of the Symphony Parties, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand, or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by
any of the Symphony Parties, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, or
(ii) compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions contained
herein, shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No such waiver
shall constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other inaccuracy, breach or failure to strictly comply with the provisions of
this Agreement.

            Section 10.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
                          -----------------

certificates, lists and documents referred to herein, and any documents executed

herewith or pursuant thereto) and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the
entire agreement of the parties hereto, except as provided herein, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

            Section 10.3. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.
                          ------------------------------------------------------
All representations and warranties in this Agreement, including any covenants
made a part of this Agreement, or in any instrument executed and delivered in
fulfillment of the requirements of this Agreement and any covenants or other
agreements the performance of which is specified to occur on or prior to the
Closing Date or the Closing shall survive the Closing for 18 months following
the Closing Date; except that the representations and warranties in Sections
2.5, 3.1, 3.5 and 8.1 shall not terminate, but shall continue until the
expiration of the statute of limitations relating thereto. All covenants or
other agreements which by their terms are required to be performed after the
Closing, and the releases set forth in the Closing Releases, shall survive the
Closing indefinitely or for such lesser period of time as may be specified
herein.

            Section 10.4. Interpretation.
                          ---------------

            (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or
Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of this
Agreement," "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context
otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the first
paragraph of this Agreement.

            (b) Each of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule shall set forth items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in
a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of such party's
representations or warranties or one or more of its covenants contained in
Article V, in each case making reference to the particular section of this
Agreement requiring such disclosure or to which such exception is being taken.
The inclusion of any information in any section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or other document delivered by any of
the parties hereto pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed to be an
admission or evidence of the materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a
standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

            Section 10.5. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement
                          -------------
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms
and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

                          --------
