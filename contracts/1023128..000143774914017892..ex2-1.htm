"Seller" 

 



 



 



 

Terms used in this Stock Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") are defined where
they are first used or in Appendix I.

 



 

A. DCH Auto Group (USA) Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and
its Subsidiaries own car dealerships that own and sell New Cars, Used Cars and
Parts and provide maintenance and repair and other services in New York, New
Jersey and California.

 



 

B. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 2,500,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock"), of
which, as of the date of this Agreement, 2,432,612 shares are issued and
outstanding (the "Company Shares").

 



 

C. As of the date of this Agreement, the ESOP Trustee holds 132,622.44
Company Shares (of which 7639.53 remain unallocated)(the "ESOP Shares"), and
the Company intends to redeem from the ESOP Trustee the ESOP Shares for a
price to be agreed to between the Company and the ESOP Trustee (the "ESOP
Payment").

 



 

D. Mr. Shau-wai Lam owns 58,800 Company Shares (the "Lam Shares"), and the
Company intends to redeem from Mr. Lam, and Mr. Lam intends to sell to the
Company, the Lam shares pursuant to a Stock Redemption Agreement to be entered
into between Mr. Lam and the Company on or after the date hereof (the "Lam
Stock Redemption Agreement") for an aggregate price of $10,151,820.00 (the
"Lam Stock Price").

 



 

 



   



 

E. Seller owns 2,241,200 Company Shares (the "Shares") and Seller wishes
to sell to Buyer, and Buyer wishes to purchase from Seller, the Shares,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



 

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows.

 



 

SECTION 1 
PURCHASE AND SALE

 



 

1.01 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, at the Closing, Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase
from Seller, the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, for the
consideration specified in Section 1.02.

 



 

1.02 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares (the "Purchase
Price") shall be Goodwill _plus_ Tangible Net Worth _minus_ (if not already
included in Tangible Net Worth) the Lam Stock Price _minus_ (if not already
included in Tangible Net Worth) the ESOP Stock Redemption Amount using the
methodologies set forth below:

 



 

● "Goodwill" means the goodwill and intangible assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and shall be valued at $205,000,000.

 



 

● "Tangible Net Worth" means all tangible assets (i.e., all assets
excluding goodwill and intangible assets) minus all liabilities of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, with the following additional adjustments as of the
Closing Date in the case of the finally determined Tangible Net Worth:

 



      |  

o

 |  

A LIFO adjustment to increase the Tangible Net Worth by multiplying the LIFO
reserve as shown on the Initial Acquisition Balance Sheet and the Final
Acquisition Balance Sheet by the product of 1 minus the combined statutory
federal and state tax rates for the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on
December 31, 2013, estimated to be 0.42, for a result of 0.58. This shall be
done to gross up the inventory value to FIFO while offsetting the tax
liability associated with the conversion to FIFO. 

---|---|--- 
 



      |  

o __

 |  

Adjustments to reflect the fair value of Real Property as set forth on
Schedule 1.02 and based on the information with respect to the Real Property
set forth on the spreadsheet delivered by Seller to Buyer dated as of the date
of this Agreement (the "Real Property Spreadsheet"); _provided_ that the
aggregate amount of such adjustments shall not increase Tangible Net Worth by
less than $23,000,000 nor increase Tangible Net Worth by more than
$29,000,000. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

 



   



      |  

o

 |  

An adjustment to reflect acquisitions between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date determined in good faith by Buyer and Seller, provided such
acquisitions were not made in violation of Section 4.01(b)(ix). 

---|---|--- 
 



      |  

o

 |  

To the extent not already reflected in Tangible Net Worth (including as a
reserve), an adjustment to decrease Tangible Net Worth by (x) the expenses of
the Company or any Subsidiary incurred in connection with the preparation of
this Agreement and the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether payable before, on or after the Closing Date; and (y) any
bonus or retention payments made by the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all applicable employer Taxes payable with respect
thereto, whether payable before, on or after the Closing Date, provided,
however, that any post-Closing retention payments guarantees reflected in
Tangible Net Worth shall be added back to Tangible Net Worth. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

● "ESOP Stock Redemption Amount" means an amount equal to (x) if the
ESOP Shares are redeemed on or before the Closing Date, the aggregate
redemption price or (y) if the ESOP Shares are not redeemed on or before the
Closing Date, an aggregate amount equal to (A) Goodwill _plus_ Tangible Net
Worth _minus_ the Lam Stock Price, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of ESOP Shares outstanding at the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number ESOP Shares outstanding at the Closing Date
plus the Shares.

 



 

The Initial Acquisition Balance Sheet and the Final Acquisition Balance Sheet,
except as set forth above, will be prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") applied using the same accounting
methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that
were used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements for the
Company's most recent fiscal year.

 



 

(a) _Initial Purchase Price_. The initial Purchase Price for the
Shares shall be calculated based on the initial determination of Tangible Net
Worth as of August 31, 2014 (the "Initial Purchase Price"). Working together
from the date of execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall jointly
prepare an initial acquisition balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries dated as of August 31, 2014 to determine Tangible Net Worth as of
such date (the "Initial Acquisition Balance Sheet"). A template of the
calculation to determine the Initial Purchase Price is attached as Schedule
1.02(a).

 



 

(b) _Initial Purchase Price Payment._ The Initial Purchase Price
will be paid as follows: (x) issuance to Seller of a number shares of Class A
Common Stock of Buyer, ticker symbol LAD on the New York Stock Exchange
("Lithia Shares"), determined by dividing $22,500,000 by the volume-weighted
average trading price of Lithia Shares in the 30 trading days ending on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date ("Stock Consideration") and (y) an
amount in cash equal to the Initial Purchase Price minus $22,500,000 (the
"Cash Consideration"). At the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Initial Purchase
Price as follows:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) with respect to the Cash Consideration, Buyer shall (x) withhold
an amount equal to 8% of the Initial Purchase Price, if the ESOP Shares are
not redeemed at the time of Closing, or 3% of the Initial Purchase Price, if
the ESOP Shares are redeemed at the time of Closing (the "Holdback Amount") to
secure the payment to Buyer of any Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to Section
1.02(e) and (y) pay the remainder of the Cash Consideration by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, as follows:

 



      |  

(A)

 |  

Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to the difference of 10% of the Initial
Purchase Price minus $22,500,000 into an interest-bearing account (the
"Indemnity Escrow") to be held and released pursuant to the terms of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement
(the "Indemnity Escrow Agreement"); and 

---|---|--- 
 



      |  

(B)

 |  

Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the remaining Cash Consideration as
designated in writing by Seller to Buyer no later than five Business Days
before the Closing Date; and 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(ii) with respect to the Stock Consideration, Buyer shall deposit the
Lithia Shares into the Indemnity Escrow to be held and released pursuant to
the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Calculation of the Final Purchase Price._ Within 45 days after
the Closing, Seller shall prepare, and may engage Seller's Accountants to
assist it in preparing, financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries consisting of an audited balance sheet dated as September 30,
2014 (the "Final Acquisition Balance Sheet") and unaudited statements of
income and retained earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flow for the nine-
month period then ended (in each case, without giving effect to the
transactions contemplated herein). Seller shall prepare a statement setting
forth the final determination of Tangible Net Worth as of the Closing Date,
which shall be based on the Final Acquisition Balance Sheet, and the final
Purchase Price (which, together with the Final Acquisition Balance Sheet,
shall be the "Closing Statement"). The Closing Statement (including the Final
Acquisition Balance Sheet) shall not be final unless and until approved by
Buyer in writing, which approval or rejection must be made by Buyer in writing
within 30 days of its receipt thereof or such failure to notify Seller shall
be deemed an approval of the Closing Statement. The final Purchase Price (the
"Final Purchase Price") shall be calculated in the same manner as the Initial
Purchase Price.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Resolution of Balance Sheet Disagreements_. If Buyer and Seller
are unable to agree on either the Initial Acquisition Balance Sheet by
September 20, 2014 or on the Closing Statement (including the Final
Acquisition Balance Sheet) within 30 days after Seller delivers the Closing
Statement to Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall resolve any such Disputed Amounts
pursuant to Section 10.14.

 



 

(e) _Final Difference Payments._ After Buyer agrees in writing that
the Closing Statement (including the Final Acquisition Balance Sheet) is final
(or fails to notify Seller of its acceptance or rejection of the Closing
Statement within 30 days of the receipt thereof or any Disputed Amounts are
resolved pursuant to Section 10.14), the parties shall determine whether
either owes any amount to the other under this Section 1.02(e) (any such
amount, the "Post-Closing Adjustment").

 



 

(i) If the Initial Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
Buyer shall pay Seller, within five Business Days of the determination
thereof, in cash the Holdback Amount and the amount by which the Final
Purchase Price exceeds the Initial Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) If the Initial Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase
Price, (A) Buyer shall retain the difference from the Holdback Amount and pay
the remaining Holdback Amount, if any, to Seller or (B) if the difference
between the Initial Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price is greater
than the Holdback Amount, Buyer shall retain the Holdback Amount and Seller
shall pay to Buyer, within five Business Days of the determination thereof, in
cash the amount by which the difference between the Initial Purchase Price and
the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Holdback Amount.

 



 

1.03 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
purchase and sale of the Shares shall be completed at a closing (the
"Closing") to be held at 9:00 a.m. PDT on October 1, 2014; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that either Buyer or Seller may extend the Closing to a date not
later than October 31, 2014 with written notice to the other party prior to
October 1, 2014. The day on which the Closing takes place is the "Closing
Date."

 



 

SECTION 2 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 



 

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the Disclosure
Schedules, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that the statements
contained in this Section 2 are true and correct as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date. The delivery of Disclosure Schedules and updates to the

are held by any Subsidiary as treasury shares. There is no existing option,

securities of any Person other than the Subsidiaries set forth in Section 2.04

date of this Agreement) between the Company, any Subsidiary and customers or
suppliers of the Company or any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of
any Person traded on any national securities exchange if Seller is not a
controlling Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and
does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of
such Person.

 



 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee
of the Company or any Subsidiary or encourage any such employee to leave such
employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except
pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any
such employees; _provided, that_ nothing in this Section 4.07(b) shall prevent
Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose employment
has been terminated by the Company, any Subsidiary or Buyer or (ii) after 120
days from the date of termination of employment, any employee whose employment
has been terminated by the employee.

 



 

(c) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit

attempt to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of the Company or any
Subsidiary or potential clients or customers of the Company or any Subsidiary
for purposes of diverting their business or services from the Company or any
Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this
Section 4.07 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief,
including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance
and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent
jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

 



 

(e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section
4.07 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer
and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 4.07 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this
Section 4.07 and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants
and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the
remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for Seller's execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
performance of Seller's obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Seller Transaction Documents and the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall cooperate fully with Buyer and
its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents,

the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals.

any Seller Transaction Document has been issued, to have such Governmental
Order vacated or lifted.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve any
right or benefit under any Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller, the Company and each
Subsidiary shall, subsequent to the Closing, use its respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain such consent, approval or authorization as promptly
thereafter as practicable. If such consent, approval or authorization cannot
be obtained, Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to provide the Company or

term thereof, and, if Seller provides such rights and benefits, the Company or
such Subsidiary shall assume all expenses, obligations and burdens thereunder.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.08 shall
require, or be construed to require, Seller or any of its Affiliates to agree
to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue, limit or fail to renew, before the
Closing Date or the termination of this agreement, any assets, businesses or
interests of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the
economic or business benefits to Seller of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions
in, the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests which, in
either case, would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the economic or business
benefits to Seller of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or
(iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

between Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary or Buyer with Governmental
Authorities in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not
permitted by Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall
be disclosed to Buyer in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it
being the intent that Seller will consult and cooperate with Buyer, and
consider in good faith the views of Buyer, in connection with any such
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Seller shall give notice to Buyer
with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any
Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, in each case, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, with such notice being sufficient to provide Buyer with the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance
or contact.

SECTION 5 
COVENANTS OF BUYER

expenses (the "Commitments") (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with the
lenders set forth in the Capital Plan consistent with the terms and conditions

thereby becomes unavailable and Buyer is using its reasonable best efforts to
obtain Alternate Financing (as defined below). In the event that any portion

(in an amount sufficient to pay the cash portion of the Initial Purchase
Price) from other sources and which do not include any conditions to the

conditions set forth in the Capital Plan (the "Alternate Financing"), and (ii)

SECTION 7 
TAX MATTERS

 



 

7.01 Tax Covenants.

 



 

(a) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller (and, prior to
the Closing, the Company, its Subsidiaries, their Affiliates and their
respective Representatives) shall not, to the extent it may affect, or relate
to, the Company or its Subsidiaries, make, change or rescind any Tax election,
amend any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return, take any action,
omit to take any action or enter into any other transaction that would have
the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of Buyer,
the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of any Post-Closing Tax Period.
Seller agrees that Buyer is to have no liability for any Tax resulting from
any action of Seller, the Company, its Subsidiaries, their Affiliates or any
of their respective Representatives, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer (and, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) against
any such Tax or reduction of any Tax asset.

 



 

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value
added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
(including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be
borne as set forth in Section 10.01 and paid when due. Seller shall, at its
own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect to such
Taxes or fees (and Buyer shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

 



 

(c) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required
by Law) and without a change of any election or any accounting method and
shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller (together with schedules, statements
and, to the extent requested by Seller, supporting documentation) at least 45
days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If
Seller objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within 10 days
after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Buyer in writing that it so objects,
specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual
or legal basis for any such objection. Buyer shall take into account in good
faith any such objection raised by Shareholders in finalizing any such Tax
Return for filing. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company
or any Subsidiary that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
exclusively within the control of Buyer.

 



 

7.02 Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. At the request of
Buyer, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to terminate any
and all existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding upon
the Company or any Subsidiary effective as of the Closing Date, and no party
shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

 



 

 



   



 

7.03 Tax Indemnification. Except to the extent included as a liability in
the calculation of Tangible Net Worth, Seller shall indemnify the Company,
each Subsidiary, Buyer, and each Buyer Indemnitee and hold them harmless from
and against (a) any Loss attributable to any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made in Section 2.21; (b) any Loss attributable to
any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform, any covenant,
agreement, undertaking or obligation in this Section 7; (c) all Pre-Closing
Taxes; (d) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which the Company or any Subsidiary (or any predecessor of
the Company or any Subsidiary) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing
Date by reason of a liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any comparable provisions of foreign, state or local Law; and (e) any and all
Taxes of any person imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary arising under the
principles of transferee or successor liability or by contract, relating to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date, in each of the above
cases, together with any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys'
and accountants' fees) incurred in connection therewith. Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary that are the
responsibility of Seller pursuant to this Section 7.03 within 10 Business Days
after payment of such Taxes by Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary. All
indemnity payments pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall be made on an after-
tax, grossed-up basis, such that the total amount received by Buyer places
Buyer in the same after-tax position it would have occupied if it had not
suffered such Loss or been liable for such Taxes.

 



 

7.04 Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect
to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (each
such period, a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Taxes that are
treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

 



 

(a) in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income,
receipts, profits, wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed in connection
with the sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (iii) required to be
withheld, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable
year ended with the Closing Date; and

 



 

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire period.

 



 

7.05 Contests. Buyer agrees to give written notice to Seller of the
receipt of any written notice by the Company or any Subsidiary, Buyer or any
of Buyer's Affiliates which involves the assertion of any claim, or the
commencement of any Action, in respect of which an indemnity may be sought by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 7 (a "Tax Claim"); _provided, that_ failure to
comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer's right to indemnification
hereunder. Buyer shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim;
_provided, however,_ that Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the
status of such contest and shall take into account in good faith any comments
or suggestions made by Seller before entering into any settlement of a claim
or ceasing to defend such claim.

 



 

 



   



 

7.06 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Seller and Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this
Section 7 or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together
with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by tax authorities. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company or any
Subsidiary for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to
the extent notified by the other parties in writing of such extensions for the
respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Company or any Subsidiary for any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer (as the case
may be) shall provide the other party with reasonable written notice and offer
the other party the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

 



 

7.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification
payments pursuant to this Section 7 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Final Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 



 

7.08 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the provisions of Section 2.21 and this Section 7 shall survive for the full
period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof).

 



 

7.09 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant
to Section 8 may overlap with an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this
Section 7, the provisions of this Section 7 shall govern.

 



 

SECTION 8 
INDEMNIFICATION AND ESCROW

 



 

8.01 Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and warranties contained in the Seller
Transaction Documents and the Buyer Transaction Documents (other than any
representations or warranties contained in Section 2.21 ( _Taxes_ ) which are
subject to Section 7) shall survive the Closing until the date that is 21
months from the Closing Date; _provided, that_ the representations and
warranties in Section 2.01 ( _Organization and Authority of Seller_ ), Section
2.02 ( _Organization, Authority and Qualification of the Company),_ Section
2.03 ( _Capitalization_ ), Section 2.23 ( _Brokers_ ), Section 3.01 (
_Organization and Authority of Buyer_ ), Section 3.02 ( _Buyer Shares_ ) and
Section 3.07 ( _Brokers_ ) shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. All covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in the Seller Transaction Documents and the Buyer Transaction
Documents (other than any covenants or agreements contained in Section 7,
which are subject to Section 7) shall survive the Closing for 21 months or for
the period explicitly specified therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
claims asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity and in writing by
notice from the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not thereafter be
barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or warranty and such
claims shall survive until finally resolved.

 



 

 



   



 

8.02 Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Section 8, Seller shall indemnify and defend each of Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company and any Subsidiary) and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") against, and shall
hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each
of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Buyer Indemnitees based upon:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or
warranties of Seller contained in the Seller Transaction Documents or any
certificate delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.01(f), 6.01(h) or 6.01(i)
(other than in respect of Section 2.21, it being understood that the sole
remedy for any such inaccuracy in or breach thereof shall be pursuant to
Section 7), as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if
such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date,
the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date);

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant
to any Seller Transaction Document (other than any breach or violation of, or
failure to fully perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation
in Section 7, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach,
violation or failure shall be pursuant to Section 7); or

 



 

(c) (i) any Actions or Taxes related to or resulting from the
redemption by the Company of any Company Shares or the Merger (defined below),
including any Actions or Taxes arising under ERISA or the Code; or (ii) if the
Company has not redeemed the Company Shares prior to or concurrently with the
Closing, the Company completing a merger (the "Merger") under Section 253 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") after the Closing to acquire
100% of the Common Stock of the Company, including, in connection therewith,
the Company's payment to former holders of Company Shares who exercise
appraisal or dissenters' rights under the DGCL.

 



 

 



   



 

8.03 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Section 8, Buyer shall indemnify and defend Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees")
against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay
and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by,
or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnitees based upon:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or
warranties of Buyer contained in any Buyer Transaction Document or any
certificate delivered to Seller pursuant to Section 6.02(f), 6.02(g) or
6.02(i), as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if such
representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date, the
inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date);

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Buyer pursuant to any Buyer Transaction Document
(other than Section 7, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such
breach thereof shall be pursuant to Section 7) ; or

 



 

(c) any Loss arising from any access granted or testing conducted by
Buyer or its Representatives pursuant to Section 4.02 ( _Access to
Information_ ) hereof.

 



 

8.04 Certain Limitations. The indemnification provided for in Section 8.02
and Section 8.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(a) Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnitee for
indemnification under Section 8.02(a) for any claim where the aggregate Losses
related to such claim are less than $200,000 unless the claim is part of a
series of claims arising from the same facts and circumstances where the
aggregate Losses relating to such series of claims are greater than $200,000.
Seller shall be liable to Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification under Section
8.02(a) only to the extent that Buyer Indemnitees' Losses under Section
8.02(a), in the aggregate, exceed $2,000,000 (the "Basket"), in which event
Seller shall be required to pay or be liable for all such Losses from the
first dollar.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnitees for
indemnification under Section 8.03(a) for any claim where the aggregate Losses
related to such claim are less than $200,000 unless the claim is part of a
series of claims arising from the same facts and circumstances where the
aggregate Losses relating to such series of claims are greater than $200,000.
Buyer shall be liable to Seller Indemnitees for indemnification under Section
8.03(a) only to the extent that Seller Indemnitees' Losses under Section
8.03(a), in the aggregate, exceed the Basket, in which event Buyer shall be
required to pay or be liable for all such Losses from the first dollar.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other
than Section 8.04(d) and except as provided in Section 10.12 ( _Liquidated
Damages_ ), the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered
by Seller or by Buyer pursuant to this Section 8 shall be an amount equal to
10% of the Final Purchase Price (the "Cap").

 



 

(d) The provisions of Section 8.04(a), Section 8.04(b) or Section

any representation, warranty or covenant in Section 2.01, Section 2.03,
Section 2.21, Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 4.16 or Section 7 or
indemnification under Section 8.02(c) and shall not apply to Losses based upon
claims of fraud.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Section 8, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined (i) without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or Knowledge contained in such
representation or warranty and (ii) assuming that each dollar amount set forth
in Sections 2.07, 2.11(g), 2.16(a) and 2.20(c) was $0.00.

 



 

8.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Section 8 is referred to as the "Indemnified Party," and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Section 8 is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party."

 



 

(a) Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of such
Third-Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses or is otherwise prejudiced by reason of such failure.

 



 

Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, Seller
shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third
Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it shall have
the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party.

 



 

 



   



 

The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided,
that_ if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A)
there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party which the
Indemnifying Party is unable to or refuses to assert; or (B) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is necessary
or appropriate. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend
such Third-Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to
diligently prosecute the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third-
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the
provisions of Section 4.06) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(b) Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party unless such settlement (1) includes, as an unconditional
term thereof, a written release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities
and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and (2) does not
impose any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 8.05(a), it
shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party unless such settlement (x) includes, as an unconditional
term thereof, a written release of the Indemnifying Party from all liabilities
and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and (y) does not
impose any liability or obligation on the Indemnifying Party other than
financial obligation for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt and complete written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise prejudiced by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its receipt
of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified
Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Buyer's or the Company's and each Subsidiary's, as applicable, premises
and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or
records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party rejects the claim, in whole or
in part, or does not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Tax Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in respect of Taxes
of the Company or any Subsidiary (including, but not limited to, any such
claim in respect of a breach of the representations and warranties in Section
2.21 hereof or any breach or violation of or failure to fully perform any
covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Section 7) shall be governed
exclusively by Section 7 hereof.

 



 

8.06 Payments. The amount of any Losses payable under this Section 8 (or
any provisions of this Agreement that expressly provides for indemnification)
by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (a) amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible therefor and (b) Tax benefit realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses.
If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any
other Person potentially responsible, for any Losses payable under this
Section 8 (or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides
for indemnification). The Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to
provide any indemnity hereunder to the extent the Indemnified Party's claim
under any applicable insurance policies remains outstanding. Once a Loss is
agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to be payable
pursuant to this Section 8, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its
obligations within 30 Business Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Indemnified Party. The
parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment
of any such obligations within such 30 Business Day period, any amount payable
shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to but excluding the
date such payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Such interest
shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number
of days elapsed, without compounding.

 



 

 



   



 

8.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 



 

8.08 Duty to Mitigate. After the Closing, the Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses under this Section 8,
including notifying the Indemnifying Party of any inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty or any breach of a covenant or agreement contained
herein within thirty (30) days after discovering such inaccuracy or breach.

 



 

8.09 Exclusive Remedies. Except with respect to any adjustment under
Section 1.02(e), and subject to Section 4.15, Section 10.11 and Section 10.12,
the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal
activity or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth in the
Seller Transaction Documents and the Buyer Transaction Documents or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in Section 7 and this Section 8\. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth in the Seller Transaction Documents and the Buyer Transaction Documents
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have
against the other party hereto and its Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in Section 7 and this Section 8\. Nothing
in this Section 8.09 shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief (including specific performance) to which any Person shall be
entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any party's fraudulent, criminal
or intentional misconduct. To the extent any Losses are included in the
calculation of Tangible Net Worth, Buyer Indemnitees are not entitled to
recover for such Losses through this Section 8.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 9 
TERMINATION

 



 

9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by Buyer by written notice to Seller if:

 



 

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a material breach or inaccuracy in or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions specified in Section 6 and such material breach, inaccuracy or
failure has not been cured by Seller within 30 days of Seller's receipt of
written notice of such breach from Buyer; or

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth Section 6.01 shall not have been, or
if it becomes apparent that any of such conditions will not be, fulfilled by
October 31, 2014, unless such failure shall be due to the failure of Buyer to
perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof
to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing;

 



 

(c) at any time on or before August 14, 2014, by Buyer in its
reasonable discretion based on the results of its ongoing due diligence
investigation relating to the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that Seller shall have the right to deliver and update the
Disclosure Schedules at any time on or before July 15, 2014;

 



 

(d) Prior to August 14, 2014, by Buyer by written notice to Seller if
Buyer determines that it will not be able to obtain the financing contemplated
by the Capital Plan or Alternate Financing by the Closing Date through the use
of commercially reasonable efforts;

 



 

(e) by Seller by written notice to Buyer if:

 



 

(i) Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions specified in Section 6 and such material breach, inaccuracy or
failure has not been cured by Buyer within 30 days of Buyer's receipt of
written notice of such breach from Seller; or

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 shall not have been,
or if it becomes apparent that any of such conditions will not be, fulfilled
by October 31, 2014, unless such failure shall be due to the failure of Seller
to perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions
hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing;

 



 

(f) by Buyer or Seller in the event that (i) there shall be any Law

THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY SHALL BE INSTITUTED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL
COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE OR THE

SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION
OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL
TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS
FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF
VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY

would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

10.12 Liquidated Damages.

 



 

(a) If, before October 1, 2014 (or such later date as extended
pursuant to Section 1.03):

 



 

 



   



 

(i) the conditions in Section 6.02 have been met but Seller fails to
deliver the Shares to Buyer, or if failure to fulfill such conditions is due
to Seller's willful or intentional breach of this Agreement (the "Seller's
Failure to Close"), and Buyer has financing available to pay the Initial
Purchase Price and is willing and able to consummate the Closing, then Buyer
may terminate this Agreement and Seller shall pay, on Buyer's demand and in
lieu of all other remedies available to it, to Buyer, $20,000,000; and

 



 

(ii) the conditions in Section 6.01 have been met but the Buyer fails to
deliver the Initial Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1.02(b), or if
failure to fulfill such conditions is due to Buyer's willful or intentional
breach of this Agreement (the "Buyer's Failure to Close"), and Seller is
willing and able to deliver the Shares to Buyer, then Seller may terminate
this Agreement and Buyer shall pay, on Seller's demand and in lieu of other
remedies available to Seller, to Seller $20,000,000.

 



 

Any payment owing by Seller pursuant to Section 10.12(a)(i) or owing by Buyer
pursuant to Section 10.12(a)(ii) is referred to herein as "Liquidated
Damages."

 



 

(b) The parties intend that the Liquidated Damages constitute
compensation, and not a penalty. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
harm caused by Seller's Failure to Close or the Buyer's Failure to Close would
be impossible or very difficult to accurately estimate as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the date when the conditions in specified above have been
fulfilled, and that the Liquidated Damages are a reasonable estimate of the
anticipated or actual harm that would likely arise from the Seller's Failure
to Close or the Buyer's Failure to Close. If Buyer or Seller elect to receive
Liquidated Damages, the payment of the Liquidated Damages will be the Seller's
or Buyer's respective sole liability and entire obligation and the Buyer's or
Seller's respective exclusive remedy for the Seller's Failure to Close or the
Buyer's Failure to Close, as applicable.

 



 

10.13 Disclosure Schedules. If a disclosure is made in any section of the
Disclosure Schedules, such disclosure will be deemed to have also been made in
any another section of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to
the other section. The fact that any item or information has been included in
the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission of liability under
any applicable Law, or construed to establish, in whole or in part, that such
information is required to be disclosed in or by the Disclosure Schedules or
this Agreement, or to mean that such information is material . Such
information shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the term "material,"
"materially," "materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
qualification in this Agreement.

 



 

10.14 Resolution of Disputes Regarding Initial Acquisition Balance Sheet
or Closing Statement (Including Final Acquisition Balance Sheet).

 



 

 



   



 

(a) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Initial
Acquisition Balance Sheet or Closing Statement (including the Final
Acquisition Balance Sheet), then any amounts remaining in dispute ("Disputed
Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of Moss Adams LLP
or, if Moss Adams LLP is unable to serve, Buyer and Seller shall appoint by
mutual agreement the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants other than Seller's Accountants or
Buyer's Accountants (the "Independent Accountants") who, acting as experts and
not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any
adjustments. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made
without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountants shall only decide
the specific items under dispute by the parties, and their decision for each
Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item
by Seller and Buyer.

 



 

(b) _Fees of the Independent Accountants_. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountants shall be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and by
Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually
contested but not awarded to Seller or Buyer, respectively, bears to the
aggregate amount actually contested by Seller and Buyer.

 



 

(c) _Determination by Independent Accountants_. The Independent
Accountants shall make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days
(or such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments
to the Closing Statement (including the Final Acquisition Balance Sheet) shall
be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

 



 

10.15 Withholding Tax. Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Final Purchase Price all Taxes that Buyer and the
Company are required to deduct and withhold under any provision of Tax Law.
All such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as paid hereunder.

 



 

10.16 Tax Treatment of Payments and Adjustments. All payments from Buyer
to Seller pursuant to Section 1, including any adjustment payments made
pursuant to Section 1.02(e), shall be treated as payments of, or adjustments
to, the Final Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 



 

10.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy
of this Agreement.
