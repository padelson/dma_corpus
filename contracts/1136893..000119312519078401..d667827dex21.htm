immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Class_ __ _ A Common
Stock_"), except for shares of Company Class A Common Stock owned by the
Company as treasury stock or otherwise owned by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries (in each case, other

right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old
Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to an "Old
Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Class A Common

represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_,

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Class A Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend,

applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall be interpreted
such that Parent or the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any
action with respect to its securities that requires consent pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of (i) Company Class A Common Stock that are owned
by the Company, Parent or any of their respective direct or indirect
Subsidiaries (in each case, other than the Exception Shares) immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) Class B common stock, no par value per share,

purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_
") granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to represent an option to purchase shares of Company Class A
Common Stock and be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (such option, a " _Converted Stock Option_ ") equal to

 



3

    

 the product (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(i) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to each such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Class
A Common Stock of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to the Converted Stock Option shall be determined
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum,
rounded to the nearest one hundredth, equal to (x) the Exchange Ratio, plus
(y) the quotient of (1) the Cash Consideration, divided by (2) the Parent
Stock Price. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective
Time, each Converted Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions (including vesting, forfeiture and exercisability terms)
as were applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Company Stock
Plans_ " means the Companys 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, the
Worldpay Group plc Transitional Award Plan, the Worldpay Group plc 2017
Performance Share Plan, the Worldpay Group plc Deferred Bonus Share Plan, the
Worldpay Group plc Conditional Share Plan, and the Mercury Payment Systems,

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding award
of restricted shares of Company Class A Common Stock (a " _Company Restricted
Share_ ") shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, cease to represent restricted shares of Company Class A
Common Stock and be converted into a number of restricted shares of Parent
Common Stock (each, a " _Converted Restricted Share_ ") equal to the product
(with the result rounded up to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of
Company Restricted Shares subject to each such award multiplied by (ii) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that, with respect to Company
Restricted Shares that are subject to performance-vesting conditions ("
_Company Performance Share Awards_ "), (A) for purposes of determining the
number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to the Company
Performance Share Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time, performance
shall be deemed to be achieved based on the Applicable Achievement Level and
(B) following the Effective Time, the Converted Restricted Shares in respect
of the Company Performance Share Awards shall cliff-vest based on continued
service to Parent and its Subsidiaries (subject to any accelerated vesting
in accordance with the terms of such Company Performance Share Awards) in
accordance with the applicable award agreement governing the Company
Performance Share Awards as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
without any ongoing performance-vesting conditions. Except as specifically
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(b)_, following the Effective Time, each
such Converted Restricted Share shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture terms) as were
applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Share immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Applicable Achievement
Level_ " means with respect to (1) awards denominated as "Performance Share
Unit Acquisition Awards," 300% of the target level, (2) all other awards with
a performance period beginning in 2017 or 2018, 200% of the target level, (3)
awards with a performance period beginning in 2019, 133% of the target level
and (4) awards granted prior to the date hereof with a performance period
scheduled to begin in 2020 set forth on Section 1.8(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, 100% of the target level; _provided_ that in no event
shall the Applicable Achievement Level exceed the maximum potential level of
performance that applies to an award.

(c) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit award granted under the Company Stock Plans (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, deferred stock unit awards held by non-employee directors
of the Company) (a " _Company RSU_ ") shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a
restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Company Class A Common Stock
and be converted into a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of
Parent Common Stock (a " _Converted Parent RSU_ "). The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such Converted Parent RSU shall be equal
to the product (with the result rounded up to the nearest whole number) of (i)
the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to each such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that, with respect to Company RSUs
that are subject to performance-vesting conditions (" _Company PSUs_ "), (A)
for purposes of determining the number of shares of Company Class A Common
Stock subject to the Company PSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time,
performance shall be deemed to be achieved based on the Applicable
Achievement Level and (B) following the Effective Time, the Converted Parent
RSUs in respect of the Company PSUs shall cliff-vest based on continued
service to Parent and its Subsidiaries (subject to any accelerated vesting in
accordance with the terms of such Company PSUs) in accordance with the
applicable award agreement governing the Company PSUs as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time without any ongoing performance-vesting
conditions. Except as specifically provided in this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(c)_,
following the Effective Time, each such Converted Parent RSU shall continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting, forfeiture
and settlement terms) as were applicable to the corresponding Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d)  _Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all
actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions
of the Company Board or a committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending the
terms of the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ "))
that it determines in good faith to be necessary or required under the Company
ESPP and applicable Law to ensure that, other than as provided in _Section_
__ _ 1.8(f)_, (i) except for the offering period under the Company ESPP that
commenced on or about January 1, 2019 (the " _Final Offering Period_ "),
no offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of
this Agreement, (ii) the Company shall not take any action to reduce the
applicable purchase price for a share of Company Class A Common Stock under
the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, (iii) if the Closing shall

the Effective Time and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under
the Company ESPP thereafter. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not

" _SAYE Plans_ ") in relation to shares of Class A Common Stock in the
Company (such award, a " _SAYE Award_ ") will become entitled to exercise
their SAYE Awards in connection with the Merger and receive the same
consideration in respect of the shares of common stock of the Company that
they acquire under such SAYE Awards as is payable to holders of Company Class
A Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_. If and to the extent that any
SAYE Award (that has not become a Rollover SAYE Award pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.8(e)(ii)_ below) shall be exercised by a holder of such SAYE Award
after the Effective Time, Parent, as the sole stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation, may amend the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation to provide that any share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation issued as a consequence of such exercise (a " _Post-Merger Share_
") shall immediately be transferred to Parent or be redeemed by the Surviving
Corporation, in each case, in consideration for the issuance of, or otherwise
be automatically exchanged upon such issuance for, such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock and the payment of such amount in cash as is equivalent
to the Merger Consideration which would have been received in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_ if the Post-Merger Share had constituted Company Class A
Common Stock and had been surrendered immediately following the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, such consideration to be
provided as soon as practicable and, in any event, no later than fourteen (14)
days after the transfer, redemption or exchange, as applicable, of such Post-
Merger Share.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall offer each holder, as of
the Effective Time, of a SAYE Award the opportunity to exchange such holders
SAYE Award for an award in respect of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Rollover
SAYE Award_ ") on the following terms (or as otherwise agreed with HM Revenue
and Customs):

(a) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Rollover SAYE
Award will be equal to the product (with the result rounded up to the nearest
whole number) of (x) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock
subject to each such SAYE Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; and

(b) all other terms and conditions of the SAYE Awards will continue to apply,
including the original vesting and exercise periods, the aggregate exercise
price payable and the terms and conditions of the original savings contract.

the SAYE Plans, any SAYE Awards that are not exchanged for awards of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with the above terms will cease to be capable of

Date, at which point such SAYE Awards will lapse and no consideration shall
be payable in respect thereof (to the extent not exercised).

 

(iv) Parent and the Company agree that the terms of all SAYE Awards will be
amended in accordance with the terms of the SAYE Plans, with effect as of the
Effective Time, to provide that the shares subject to the SAYE Awards are
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(e)_,
in the event that the performance of any of the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.8(e)_ shall be deemed not in accordance with, or unadvisable
pursuant to, applicable Law by either Parent or the Company, in each case,
after consultation with the other party and outside legal counsel, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to explore alternative
structural mechanisms that would result in the exchange of the SAYE Awards,
upon exercise of such SAYE Awards by the applicable holders thereof, for the
Merger Consideration as described in _Section_ __ _ 1.8(e)(i)_.

(f) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company
Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board (the " _Company
Compensation Committee_ "), as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions that each of them determines in good faith are necessary to
(i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options, the Company
Restricted Shares, the Company RSUs, Company Class A Common Stock under the
Company ESPP and the SAYE Awards pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ through
_Section_ __ _ 1.8(e)_ and (ii) provide for the deduction, withholding and
remittance of any amounts required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver shares of Company Class A Common Stock or other capital stock of
the Company to any person pursuant to or in settlement of the Company Equity
Awards or the Company ESPP. In addition, the Company agrees to take all
actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions

to be necessary or required under the SAYE Plans and applicable Law) to effect
the exchange set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.8(e)_.

faith are necessary for the treatment of the Company Stock Options, the

1.8(e)_.

and applicable Law.

 

1.10 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws

2.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one (1) or more Old
Certificates representing shares of Company Class A Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Article I_ ,
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting of a
bond in a reasonable and customary amount as indemnity pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.2(e)_) to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting of a bond in a
reasonable and customary amount as indemnity pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2(e)_) in exchange for the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _
1.5_. From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old
Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and a check representing the Cash Consideration, in each case, to which such
holder of Company Class A Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to
the provisions of _Article I_ and (ii) a check representing the amount of any
cash in lieu of a fractional share which such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_ and for the amount of any dividends or
distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive as of such time
under _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends
or other distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Old Certificate
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends or distributions that the holder thereof
has the right to receive under _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

 

(b) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the
Company who

 



9

    

 otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the volume-
weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as such daily volume-weighted average price per
share is reported by Bloomberg L.P. (or, if such information is no longer
reported by Bloomberg L.P., as reported by a comparable internationally
recognized source mutually determined by Parent and the Company) calculated
for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the Closing Date (the " _Parent Stock Price_ ") by (ii) the
fraction of a share (with the result rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Old Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) has not been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares
of Parent Common Stock, any Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional share of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of such Old Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Old
Certificate, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(e) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Old Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.3 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under applicable
Law with respect to such

 



10

    

 shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to payment of such consideration
as may be determined to be due in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Class A Common Stock shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5_
upon surrender of such shares of Company Class A Common Stock.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall direct, in consultation
with the Company, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands;  _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to make any
payment to holders of Dissenting Shares (i) that is not conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time and (ii) unless such payment is made only
after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to any such appraisal demands. Prior to the Effective Time, any written
communication to be made by the Company to any holder of Company Class A
Common Stock with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and the Company shall consider in good faith any input from Parent
with regards to such written communication.

2.4 _No Further Ownership in Company_ _ _ _Class_ __ _ A_ _Common Stock_.
All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed
to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of the Company Class A Common Stock theretofore represented by
such New Certificates, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of the
Company Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates are presented
to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , except as otherwise provided by
applicable Law.

2.5 _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Old Certificate with respect to any Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, in each case
until the surrender of such Old Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to _Section_ __ _
2.2(d)_, following surrender of any such Old Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, there shall be
paid to the holder of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ and the amount of dividends or
other

 



11

    

 distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions paid in respect of such
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender.

 

2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the relevant taxing
authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ that (i) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by the Company that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item would reasonably be likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (ii) any disclosures
made with respect to a section of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to
qualify (A) any other section of this _Article III_ specifically referenced or
cross-referenced and (B) other sections of this _Article III_ to the extent it
is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Company Reports publicly
filed by the Company after January 1, 2018 and prior to March 16, 2019 (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under any "Risk Factors"
heading, or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all
material respects. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect
to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on
the business, results of

 



12

    

 operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following, either
individually or in the aggregate, shall be deemed to constitute or be taken
into account when determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred
or would reasonably be likely to occur: (i) changes, after the date hereof, in
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), (ii) changes,
after the date hereof, in Laws of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or other Governmental Entities, (iii)
changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political
conditions (including acts of war (whether or not declared), civil
disobedience, hostilities, terrorism, military actions or the escalation or
worsening of any of the foregoing) or in economic conditions or financial
markets (including securities, capital, equity, credit and debt markets)
conditions in the United States or elsewhere in the world, (iv) a decline, in
and of itself, in the trading price or trading volume of a partys common
stock, a credit ratings downgrade or change in ratings outlook, in and of
itself, for a party or any of its Subsidiaries or the failure, in and of
itself, to meet analyst earnings projections, earnings guidance or internal
financial forecasts, but, in each case, not including the underlying causes
thereof, (v) except for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, changes, after the
date hereof, arising out of, or resulting from, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, public disclosure of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, or public disclosure or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (vi) changes or developments in the financial
services industry generally, (vii) any changes or developments resulting from
any hurricane, flood, tornado, earthquake or other weather or natural
disaster, (viii) any changes, effects or developments arising out of, or
resulting from or in connection with, the United Kingdoms withdrawal from
the European Union or (ix) actions or omissions taken (or, in the case of
omissions, not taken) pursuant to the written consent of or at the written
request of, or actions not taken as a result of not receiving a consent
required hereunder from, Parent, in the case of the Company, or the Company,
in the case of Parent; except, with respect to subclauses (i), (ii), (iii),
(vi) or (vii), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other companies in the industry in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate). As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ ,"
when used with respect to any party or person, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing
similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party
or by one or more of its Subsidiaries. True, correct and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date hereof
(the " _Company Charter_ "), and the bylaws of the Company, as amended to the
date hereof (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), each as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept is recognized
under applicable Law, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, except where the failure to be so organized or existing or, if
applicable, in good standing would not reasonably be likely to be,
either individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable Law, in active
status and good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,

 



13

    

 state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified or in
active status and in good standing and in which the failure to be so
qualified would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and (iii) has all
requisite corporate, limited liability company, limited partnership or
other entity power, as applicable, and authority to own, lease or operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except
where the failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably be
likely to be, either individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as set forth on Section
3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and for restrictions imposed by
applicable Law, there are no restrictions on the ability of any Company
Subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions.

(c) Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof and
such Subsidiaries jurisdiction of organization.

shares of Company Class A Common Stock, 100,000,000 shares of Company Class B
Common Stock, and 10,000,000 shares of Company preferred stock, par value

shares of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock

goals, of which 2,950,179 shares would be issued based on the Applicable
Achievement Level for such Company PSUs); and (v) 10,252,826 shares of Company
Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. All of the issued and

bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on
any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote are issued or
outstanding.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
as of the date of this Agreement, no debt securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries are issued or outstanding. Other than the Company Restricted
Shares, Company Stock Options and Company RSUs (collectively, the " _Company
Equity Awards_ ") issued prior to the date of this 

 



14

    

 Agreement and the Final Offering Period under the Company ESPP, as of the
date of this Agreement, (i) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or
other commitments or agreements obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire,
any capital stock of the Company and (ii) none of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has outstanding any stock appreciation right, phantom equity,
restricted share unit, deferred share unit or similar right, agreement,
arrangement or commitment based on the book value, income or any other
attribute of or related to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has a contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting or transfer
of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Section 3.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Company Equity Awards outstanding as of
March 13, 2019 specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each
holder, (ii) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to
each such Company Equity Award and, with respect to the Company Performance
Share Awards and Company PSUs, the target number of shares of Company Class A
Common Stock, the Applicable Achievement Level and the respective performance
period with respect to each such award, (iii) the grant date of each such
Company Equity Award, (iv) the Company Stock Plan under which such Company
Equity Award was granted, (v) the exercise price and expiration date for each
Company Stock Option, and (vi) the vesting schedule of each such Company
Equity Award (other than Company Performance Share Awards and Company PSUs).
With respect to each Company Equity Award held by a Company Related Person
designated as a member of the Companys management committee, the Company has
made available to Parent the form of award agreement that was used for such
Company Equity Awards.

 

(e) Except as set forth in the last two sentences of this _Section_ __ _
3.2(e)_, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, mortgages, transfer restrictions, encumbrances and security
interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares or equity
ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. No Company Subsidiary has or is bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments
or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or
any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. As of
March 13, 2019, Fifth Third Bank owned, beneficially and of record, all of
the issued and outstanding (i) Company Class B Common Stock and (ii) Class B
limited liability company interests of Worldpay Holding, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and direct Subsidiary of the Company (such
interests, the " _Class_ __ _ B Units_"). If applicable, the Company has the
right under the Exchange Agreement to require each holder of Class B Units to
exchange the Class B Units beneficially owned by such holder (and an equal
number of shares of Company Class B Common Stock) for an equal number of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock in connection with a Change of Control
(as defined in the Exchange Agreement) as set forth in Section 2.1(b) and (c)
of the Exchange Agreement (such right, the " _Company Exchange Agreement
Right_ ").

 



15

    

(f) Except (i) for the ownership of the Company Subsidiaries or (ii) as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary beneficially owns or controls, directly
or indirectly, any equity investment in any person (whether via shares of
stock or other equity interests in any corporation, firm, partnership, joint
venture or other entity).

(g) With respect to the Company Equity Awards, (i) each grant thereof was
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, including, if applicable,
approval by the Company Board or the Company Compensation Committee, or a duly
authorized delegate thereof, and any required approval by the stockholders by
the necessary number of votes or written consents, (ii) each such grant was
made in material compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and
conditions of the applicable Company Stock Plans pursuant to which it was
issued, (iii) each grant has a grant date identical to the date on which the
Company Board or the Company Compensation Committee actually awarded such
award, or if later, the effective date of such grant deemed by the
Company Board or the Company Compensation Committee, (iv) the per share
exercise price of each Company Stock Option was not less than the fair market
value of a share of Company Class A Common Stock on the date of such grant and
each Company Stock Option qualifies for the Tax and accounting treatment
afforded to such Company Stock Option in the Companys Tax Returns and the
Company Reports, respectively, and (v) no such grant triggers any liability
for the holder thereof under Section 409A of the Code. Each right to purchase
shares of Company Class A Common Stock under the Company ESPP or any
predecessor employee stock purchase plan was granted in all material respects
in compliance with all requirements under applicable Law and all of the terms
and conditions of the Company ESPP or such predecessor plan, as applicable.
The treatment of each Company Equity Award, the Company Stock Plans, the
Company ESPP and the SAYE Plans described in  _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ is
permitted under applicable Laws and the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan and the applicable award agreement evidencing such award, or the Company
ESPP or applicable SAYE Plan, as applicable.

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the adoption of this Agreement by a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at
a meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which a quorum exists (the "
_Requisite Company Vote_ "), to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger have been duly and validly approved by the Company
Board. As of the date hereof, the Company Board has unanimously approved
and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, on the terms and

of the Company and its stockholders and has directed that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the Companys
stockholders for approval at a 

 



16

    

 duly held meeting of such stockholders and has unanimously adopted a
resolution making a recommendation to the foregoing effect. Except for the
adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement
or to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity (the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

(b) Subject to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the
Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any
provision of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws, or (ii) assuming that

performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or creations which, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be likely to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or (2) prevent or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

as applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any

Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or

amendments or modifications filed after the date of this Agreement with
respect to reports and documents filed before the date of this Agreement),
each of such reports and documents, including the financial statements,
exhibits and schedules thereto, complied with all Laws enforced or promulgated
by the Regulatory Agency with which they were filed, except where such failure

controls over financial reporting. These disclosures, if any, were made by
management to the Companys auditor and audit committee of the Company Board

officer and chief financial officer and, to the knowledge of the Company, as

Benefit Plan_ " means any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,

in writing and whether or not funded, in each case, which is sponsored or
maintained, or required to be contributed to, or with respect to which any

audits, investigations or proceedings by a Governmental Entity by, on behalf
of or against any Company Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto.

 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and nothing has occurred that would adversely
affect the qualification or tax exemption of any such Company Benefit Plan.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in 

 



24

    

 a transaction in connection with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to
Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code which would reasonably be likely to result in
any liability which is material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 

(e) No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by the Company or any
Company ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any Company ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability. " _Controlled Group Liability_ "

that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "), and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any
Company ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability to a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that
has not been satisfied in full.

(g) Except as (x) would not reasonably be likely to be, either individually
or in the aggregate, material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y)
required by applicable Law, (i) no Company Benefit Plan provides retiree or
post-employment medical, disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits
to any person, and (ii) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligation to provide such benefits (excluding any Company Benefit Plan that
provides for employer payment or subsidy of COBRA premiums). To the extent
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries sponsors such plans, the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary has reserved the right to amend, terminate or
modify at any time each Company Benefit Plan that provides retiree or post-
employment disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits to any
person.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could, either alone or in

severance pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation
due to any Company Related Person, (iii) directly or indirectly cause the
Company to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material benefits
under any Company Benefit Plan, or (iv) otherwise give rise to any material
liability under any Company Benefit Plan.

 



25

    

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in
combination with another event, result in the payment of any amount that
could, individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute
an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
provide, and no Company Benefit Plan or other agreement provides
any individual with the right to, a gross-up, indemnification, reimbursement
or other payment for any excise or additional taxes, interest or penalties
incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

(k) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each Company
Benefit Plan maintained primarily for the benefit of employees outside of the
United States (" _Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan_") (i) that is intended to
qualify for special tax treatment, has met all requirements for such tax
treatment, (ii) if intended to be funded and/or book-reserved is fully funded
and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions and does not have unfunded liabilities or liabilities that could
reasonably be imposed upon the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of such Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan, (iii) is in
compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws, and (iv) if intended or
required to be qualified, approved or registered with a Governmental Entity,
is and has been so qualified, approved or registered and nothing has occurred
that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such
qualification, approval or registration, as applicable.

(l) Section 3.11(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list as of the date hereof of any collective bargaining agreement
or other agreement with a labor union, works council or like organization that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by
(collectively, the " _Company Labor Agreements_ "), and, as of the date
hereof, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no material activities or
proceedings by any individual or group of individuals, including
representatives of any labor organizations or labor unions, to organize any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement, stockholder or other approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
either alone or in combination with another event, will not entitle any third
party (including any labor organization or Governmental Entity) to any
payments under any of the Company Labor Agreements. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with their obligations
pursuant to all notification and bargaining obligations arising under any
Company Labor Agreements.

 

(m) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Laws
respecting labor, employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, discrimination, harassment, wages 

 



26

suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or
authorization is threatened by any Governmental Entity, in each case of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), except where neither the failure to hold, nor
the burden of obtaining and holding, such license, franchise, permit or
authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to be, either individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2016 (i)
complied with and are not in default or violation under any applicable Laws

any Environmental Law which is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, to
the knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such Action

its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company any third-party site,
has been contaminated with any Hazardous Substance in a manner that would

liability pursuant to any Environmental Law on the

 



31

    

 part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is not subject
to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of
agreement by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to any

Intellectual Property Rights used by the Company or such Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in the conduct of its business as currently conducted, and all
such rights shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unchanged, in each case, except as would not reasonably be
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company ( _provided_ that the foregoing shall not be read as a
representation on non-infringement). 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, all Intellectual

use, validity, enforceability or ownership of any Intellectual Property
Rights owned or purported to be owned by the Company or any of its

aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary uses or distributes any software licensed under an
"open source," "copyleft," "public source" or similar license in a manner
that would require the Company or such Subsidiary (i) to disclose or make
available any source code for its proprietary software to a third party or
(ii) to limit the Companys or such Subsidiarys ability to seek full
compensation in connection with the marketing, licensing or distribution of
any of its proprietary software.

policies, all applicable Data Protection Laws and all contracts to the extent

accepted industry practices designed to ensure the confidentiality, privacy
and security of Personal Data or other confidential or trade-secret

Subsidiaries that would be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the

industry practices and Data Protection Requirements, designed to protect

person who beneficially owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the
Exchange Act) five percent (5%) or more of the outstanding Company Common

Laws, " _Takeover Statutes_ ") or any similar takeover-related provision in
the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws that would prohibit or restrict the
Companys ability to perform under this Agreement or any agreement
contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction Agreements_ ") to which the Company is
a party or the Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby, or subject Parent or its shareholders to any impediment or condition
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

3.21 _Reorganization_. After due inquiry and investigation (and consultations
with legal counsel and accountants to the extent deemed necessary), the
Company represents that it has not taken any action nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, is there any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be likely

a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

3.22 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company Board
has received an opinion (which, if initially rendered orally, has been or will
be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) from Credit Suisse, to
the effect that, as of the date thereof, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions and limitations considered by Credit Suisse in connection with the
preparation thereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of

view, to such holders. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded in any
material respect as of the date of this Agreement.

 

3.23 _Company Information_. The information relating to the Company and its

necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they are made, not misleading. The portions of the Joint Statement
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and other portions within the
reasonable control of the Company and its Subsidiaries will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. If a Prospectus is required under the Prospectus Rules
of the FCA published under section 73A(4) of the FSMA (the " _Prospectus

is provided by the Company or its representatives for inclusion in the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) on the date thereof will

material

 



35

    

 fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading. The portions of the Prospectus, if
any, relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and other portions within
the reasonable control of the Company and its Subsidiaries will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Prospectus Rules. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information provided or supplied by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries
for inclusion in the Joint Statement, the S-4 or the Prospectus (if

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries are insured with insurers
against such risks and in such amounts as the management of the Company
reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with industry
practice, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice to the effect that any of them are in default under any material
insurance policy, (b) each such policy is outstanding and in full force and
effect and, except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of
officers, directors and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Company or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficiary of such
policies, (c) all premiums and other payments due under any such policy have
been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion
and (d) there is no claim for coverage by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pending under any insurance policy as to which coverage has been
questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such insurance policy.

 

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ that (i) the mere inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by any of Parent or Merger Sub that such item represents a
material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item would
reasonably be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and
(ii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this _Article IV_
shall be deemed to qualify (A) any other section of this _Article IV_
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (B) other sections of this
_Article IV_ to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as
disclosed in any Parent Reports publicly filed by Parent after January 1,
2018 and prior to March 16, 2019 (but disregarding risk factor disclosures
contained under any "Risk Factors" heading, or disclosures of risks set forth

nature), each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company as follows:

authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
True, correct and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation of Parent, as amended to the date hereof (" _Parent Articles_
"), the Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws of Parent (" _Parent Bylaws_ "),
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Certificate_ ")

organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept is recognized
under applicable Law, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, except where the failure to be so organized or existing or, if
applicable, in good standing would not reasonably be likely to be, either
individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable Law, in active status and good

and documents filed before the date of this Agreement), each of such reports
and documents, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules

the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the

in the notes thereto, except for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its

information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to

Parent Benefit Plan that is required by applicable Law to be sponsored,
maintained, or to be contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and complete copies
of each of the material Parent Benefit Plans and, to the extent applicable,
the plan documents (including any amendments thereto), summary plan
descriptions and summaries of material modifications thereto.

 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (i) each Parent
Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including ERISA
and the Code, (ii) all contributions or other amounts payable by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan in respect of
the current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and (iii) there are no pending or
threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits) or audits,
investigations or proceedings by a Governmental Entity by, on behalf of or
against any Parent Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto.

 

(d) Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and nothing has occurred that would adversely
affect the qualification or tax exemption of any such Parent Benefit Plan.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
in connection with which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries reasonably could
be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code
which would reasonably be likely to result in any liability which is material
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(e) No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by Parent or any Parent
ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists
that presents a material risk to Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any such liability. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent ERISA
Affiliate_ " means all employers (whether or not incorporated) that would be
treated together with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as a "single employer"
within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.

(f) None of Parent and its Subsidiaries nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has, at
any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any plan that is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan, and none of Parent or its Subsidiaries nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate
has incurred any material liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms
are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in full.

(g) Except as (x) would not reasonably be likely to be, either individually or
in the aggregate, material to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y)
required by applicable Law, (i) no Parent Benefit Plan provides retiree or
post-employment medical, disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits
to any person, and (ii) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligation to provide such benefits (excluding any Parent Benefit Plan that
provides for employer payment or subsidy of COBRA premiums). To the extent
that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries sponsors such plans, Parent or the
applicable Subsidiary has reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify at
any time each Parent Benefit Plan that provides retiree or post-employment
disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits to any person.

 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby could, either alone or in conjunction
with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee, director,
officer or individual independent contractor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Related Persons_ ") to
severance pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation
due to any Parent Related Person, (iii) directly or indirectly cause Parent to
transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material benefits under any
Parent Benefit Plan, or (iv) otherwise give rise to any material liability
under any Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in
combination with another event, result in the payment of any amount that
could, individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute
an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(j) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide,
and no Parent Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any individual with
the right to, a gross-up, indemnification, reimbursement or other payment for
any excise or additional taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to
Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

(k) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each Parent Benefit
Plan maintained primarily for the benefit of employees outside of the United
States (" _Non-U.S. Parent Benefit Plan_") (i) that is intended to qualify
for special tax treatment, has met all requirements for such tax treatment,
(ii) if intended to be funded and/or book-reserved is fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions and
does not have unfunded liabilities or liabilities that could reasonably be
imposed upon the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of such
Non-U.S. Parent Benefit Plan, (iii) is in compliance with its terms and all
applicable Laws, and (iv) if intended or required to be qualified, approved or
registered with a Governmental Entity, is and has been so qualified, approved
or registered and nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
result in the loss of such qualification, approval or registration, as
applicable.

bound by (collectively, the " _Parent Labor Agreements_ "), and, as of the
date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no material activities or
proceedings by any individual or group of individuals, including
representatives of any labor organizations or labor unions, to organize any
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement, stockholder or other approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone
or in combination with another event, will not entitle any third party
(including any labor organization or Governmental Entity) to any payments
under any of the Parent Labor Agreements. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with their obligations pursuant to all
notification and bargaining obligations arising under any Parent Labor
Agreements.

Parent and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives
for inclusion in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) on
the date thereof will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The
portions of the Prospectus, if any, relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries
and other portions within

 the reasonable control of Parent and its Subsidiaries will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Prospectus Rules. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
provided or supplied by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
inclusion in the Joint Statement, the S-4 or the Prospectus (if applicable).

4.24 _Insurance_. Except as would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are insured with insurers against such risks
and in such amounts as the management of Parent reasonably has determined to
be prudent and consistent with industry practice, and neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received notice to the effect that any of them are in
default under any material insurance policy, (b) each such policy is
outstanding and in full force and effect and, except for policies insuring
against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole
beneficiary of such policies, (c) all premiums and other payments due under
any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in
due and timely fashion and (d) there is no claim for coverage by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries pending under any insurance policy as to which coverage
has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such insurance
policy.

4.25 _Sufficient Funds_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) a
fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement
and (ii) the fully executed fee letter referenced therein, relating to fees
with respect to the Financing contemplated by the commitment letter (the
commitment letter, together with such fee letter, including all exhibits,
supplements, schedules and annexes thereto, as amended, replaced,
supplemented, modified or waived from time to time after the date hereof in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_, collectively, the "
_Commitment Letter_ "), by and among Parent and the Financing Sources
specified therein (with only fee amounts and other economic terms, and the
rates and amounts included in the "flex" provisions, redacted in a customary
manner for transactions of this nature, none of which redacted provisions
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality,
availability, enforceability, termination or amount of the Financing).
Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, the Financing Sources party thereto have committed to provide Parent
with the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter for the purposes set forth
therein (the debt financing contemplated in the Commitment Letter, together
with, unless the context otherwise requires, any replacement financing,
including any bank financing or debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the "
_Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect and no amendment, supplement or
modification that would not be permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_ is
contemplated, and the Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of, and is enforceable against, Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject,
in each case, to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 



56

    

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no Financing Source is, in default in the performance, observation or
fulfillment of any obligation, covenant or condition contained in the
Commitment Letter and no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i)
constitute a default or breach by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any
other party thereto, of the Commitment Letter, (ii) constitute or result in a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth in the Commitment Letter,
or (iii) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article VII_ (other
than the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_ and _7.3(b)_ and those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date
of this Agreement, no Financing Source party to the Commitment Letter has
notified Parent of its termination or repudiation (or intent to terminate or
repudiate) any of the commitments under such Commitment Letter or intent not
to provide the Financing. Assuming (1) the truth and accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and
compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, and (2) the
satisfaction of the conditions in _Article VII_ (other than the conditions
set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_ and _7.3(b)_ and those conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver thereof), Parent has no reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the funding of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter and contained in the Commitment Letter will fail to be satisfied on the
Closing Date or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Commitment
Letter will not be available to be funded on the Closing Date.

(c) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement. Assuming (i) the funding of the full amount of the
Financing in accordance with and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
in the Commitment Letter (it being understood and agreed that nothing in this
_clause (i)_ shall be construed to limit _clause (d)_ of this _Section_ __ _
4.25_), (ii) the truth and accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ and compliance by the Company with its
obligations hereunder and (iii) the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article
VII_ (other than the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_ and _7.3(b)_
and those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), Parent and Merger
Sub will have funds available to them at the Effective Time in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with cash or cash equivalents held by Parent
and the Company on the Closing Date and the other sources of funds available
to Parent on the Closing Date, to refinance in full all amounts outstanding
under the Existing Credit Agreement, to pay the Cash Consideration, to pay
cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and
to pay the fees and expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing
(collectively, the " _Required Amount_ "). The only conditions precedent
related to the obligations of the Financing Sources party to the Commitment
Letter to fund the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter are expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written
or oral, entered into by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates
relating to the Financing other than as set forth or contemplated in the
Commitment Letter and customary engagement letters and fee credit letters with
respect to the Financing (which engagement letters and fee credit letters do
not contain any conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing or any
other provisions that would cause the Financing to not be available to Parent
on a timely basis at the Closing).

 



57

    

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under this Agreement
are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents, Merger Subs or any of
their respective affiliates or any other persons ability to obtain financing
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

later than ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company), (iii) obtain, or cause to be
obtained, from Governmental Entities all consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders set forth in Sections 7.1(f)(i)(B) and 7.1(f)(ii) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule (including the FCA Approval) or as are
otherwise necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise, in each case, as promptly as practicable, and
(iv) seek to avoid or prevent the initiation of any Action by or before any
Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in furtherance of the parties reasonable best efforts, this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_ shall require Parent and its Subsidiaries and other
affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries and other affiliates, as
applicable, in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals or any
necessary approvals of any other Governmental Entity required for the
transactions contemplated hereby or to avoid the consequences in _Section_ __
_ 6.1(a)(iv)_ or otherwise in connection with the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals required pursuant to any antitrust or competition law or the FCA
Approval to (1) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit
to, any sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other
encumbrance, or holding separate, before the Effective Time, of any assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein
(collectively, a " _Divestiture_ "); _provided_ that no such Divestiture shall
be required if such Divestiture is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole (after giving effect
to the Merger), and (2) take or agree to take any other action,

 



65

    

 agree or consent to, make any concession in respect of, or permit or suffer
to exist any condition or requirement setting forth, any limitations or
restrictions on freedom of actions with respect to, or its ability to retain,
or make changes in, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein (collectively, a " _Remedy_ "); _provided_ that
no such Remedy shall be required if such Remedy is material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole (after
giving effect to the Merger); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent can compel
the Company to take any of the actions referred to above (or agree to take
such actions) if such actions are only effective from and after the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Parent agrees and commits to litigate or participate in the
litigation of any Action involving any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act
or any other applicable antitrust or competition laws in order to: (1) oppose
or defend against any Action by any such Governmental Entity to prevent or
enjoin the consummation of the Merger; or (2) overturn any regulatory Action
by any such Governmental Entity to prevent consummation of the Merger,
including by defending any Action brought by any such Governmental Entity in
order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned, terminated or
appealed any order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Merger.

 

(b) In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to:
(i) make any required initial submissions, notifications and filings (A)
required in order to procure the satisfaction of the FCA Approval as soon as
practicable and in any event within 20 business days after the date hereof
(unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company) and (B) required in order
to procure the Dutch Central Bank Approval as soon as practicable, (ii) supply
as soon as practicable any additional information and documentation that may
be requested by the FCA in relation to the FCA Approval or (iii) subject
to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions necessary to satisfy
the FCA Approval as soon as practicable. As used herein, " _Dutch Central
Bank Approval_ " means a declaration of no objection pursuant to Section 3:95
of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht) from
the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank) in respect of Parents
acquisition of a qualifying holding (gekwalificeerde deelneming) in Worldpay
B.V.

(c) If Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates receives a request for information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, then such party shall make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law), an appropriate response in compliance
with such request. If Parent or the Company receives a formal request for
additional information or documentary material from the Federal Trade
Commission (" _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (" _Antitrust Division_ "), then Parent and the Company will
substantially comply with such formal request as soon as reasonably
practicable. Parent shall consult with the Company in good faith prior to
agreeing, directly or indirectly, to extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act or other applicable Law or to any timing agreement with the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity.

 



66

    

(d) Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any Governmental
Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and, to
the extent permitted under applicable Law, furnish the other party promptly
with all communications received from any Governmental Entity and permit the
other party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the other partys
comments to, any proposed communication, filing or submission by such party to
any Governmental Entity. The parties will coordinate and reasonably cooperate
with each other in exchanging information and providing reasonable assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in writing in connection with the
foregoing or in connection with any filing or submission to be made to any
Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials exchanged
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ may be redacted or withheld as necessary
to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Companys or Parents consideration
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other competitively
sensitive material; _provided_ , _further_ that the parties hereto may, as
they deem advisable and necessary, designate any materials provided to the
other pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the party providing such materials. Parent and
the Company shall (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) consult with
the other party in advance of any meeting, discussion or teleconference with
any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings, discussions and teleconferences. The
parties shall discuss in advance the strategy and timing for obtaining any
clearances required or advisable under any applicable Law in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) Parent shall determine such strategy and timing for
obtaining any clearances required or advisable under antitrust or competition
Laws after considering in good faith all comments and advice of the Company
(and its counsel) and (ii) Parent shall take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining such
clearances required or advisable under antitrust or competition Laws.

 

(e) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to
acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, or
take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the
taking of any other action, would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders or declarations of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Entity, in any material respect,
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk, in any material
respect, of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or
(iv) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



67

    

(f) Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, the
Joint Statement and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
S-4, in which the Joint Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
respond promptly to comments from the SEC and have the S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to
keep the S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent and the Company shall
as promptly as practicable after such filing mail or deliver the Joint
Statement to their respective shareholders and stockholders; _provided_ that
if a Prospectus is required, each of Parent and the Company shall mail or
deliver the Joint Statement to its shareholders or stockholders, respectively,
no sooner than the date on which the Prospectus is published in accordance
with the Prospectus Rules. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other party of the receipt of all comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the S-4 or the Joint
Statement or for additional information and shall promptly provide to the
other party copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to the S-4 or Joint Statement. Each
of Parent and the Company will provide their respective legal counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Joint Statement,
the S-4, responses to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto and other
documents related to the Parent Meeting, the Company Meeting or the Parent
Share Issuance, prior to filing such documents with the applicable
Governmental Entity and mailing such documents to the shareholders of Parent
and the stockholders of the Company. Each party will include in the Joint
Statement, the S-4 and such other documents related to the Parent Meeting,
the Company Meeting or the Parent Share Issuance in respect of the Merger all
comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other party or its legal
counsel, and each agrees that all information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries included in the Joint Statement and the S-4 shall be in form and
content satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably, and all information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries included in the Joint Statement
and the S-4 shall be in form and content satisfactory to the Company, acting
reasonably. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 6.1(f)_ shall not apply with respect to information relating to a Change
in Parent Recommendation or a Change in Company Recommendation, as applicable.
Each of Parent and the Company shall advise the other party, promptly after
receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the S-4, the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of shares of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts
to take all action under applicable securities Laws, rules or regulations and
to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action.

 

(g) If a Prospectus is required under applicable Law, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and
cause to be filed with the FCA for approval a draft copy of the Prospectus
(together with any application to the FCA for passporting such Prospectus into
any other required European Economic Area jurisdiction) and Parent shall cause
the Prospectus to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the requirements of applicable Laws. The Company shall furnish all
information concerning itself, its affiliates and the stockholders of the
Company to Parent and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested to determine whether the Prospectus is required under

 



68

    

 applicable Law (including any requirement to passport such Prospectus into
other European Economic Area jurisdictions), and as otherwise may reasonably
be required in respect of the preparation and approval of the Prospectus.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
formal approval of the Prospectus (such date of approval of the Prospectus,
the " _Approval Date_ "), including by supplying all such information,
executing all such documents and paying all such fees as may be reasonably
necessary or required by the FCA for the purposes of obtaining such approval.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Parent, the Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Prospectus so that it would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the FCA of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Prospectus, and to the extent required by
applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by
incorporation by reference) to the Prospectus shall be made without the
approval of both Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that this approval
right shall not apply with respect to information relating to a Change in
Parent Recommendation or Change in Company Recommendation. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the directors of Parent to publish the
Prospectus, in accordance with applicable Laws and as promptly as practicable
after the Approval Date. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of (i) the time when the Prospectus has been approved
by the FCA or any supplement or amendment has been filed or (ii) any comments,
responses or requests from the FCA relating to drafts of the Prospectus or
notification that the Prospectus is formally approved. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
from the FCA relating to drafts of the Prospectus. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to filing the Prospectus or responding to any comments
of the FCA with respect thereto, Parent and the Company shall each cooperate
and Parent shall provide the Company and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response) prior to filing with the
FCA.

(h) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, subject to _Section_ __ _
6.1(d)_, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders and stockholders and such
other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
the Joint Statement, the S-4, the Prospectus or any other statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective affiliates to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(i) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company obtains
knowledge of any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of
their respective officers, directors or other affiliates, which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4, the Joint Statement or
the Prospectus, if any, so that any such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make

 



69

    

 the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party and, to the extent required by applicable
Laws, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC or the FCA, as applicable, and, to the extent
required under applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of Parent or
the Company.

(j) To the extent that, prior to the Closing, it becomes necessary or
desirable for Parent to publish an approved prospectus in a jurisdiction
within the European Economic Area other than the United Kingdom (a " _Relevant
Member State_ ") as a result of the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the
European Union, the parties will cooperate in good faith to make alternative
arrangements pursuant to which Parent will arrange for an approved prospectus
to be published in such Relevant Member State and arrange passporting into any
other required European Economic Area jurisdiction. In this event, references
to (i) a Prospectus in this Agreement shall be deemed to include a prospectus
approved in such Relevant Member State, (ii) the FCA shall be deemed to
include the national competent authority in such Relevant Member State and
(iii) the Prospectus Rules shall be deemed to include any legislation related
to the publication of an approved prospectus in such Relevant Member State
(including, without limitation, Directive 2003/71/EC and Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 and any implementing domestic legislation in such Relevant Member
State). For the avoidance of doubt, a requirement to publish an approved
prospectus in a member state of the European Economic Area other than the
United Kingdom shall not constitute a breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to applicable Laws,
upon reasonable written notice, each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the
other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts,
personnel, information technology systems and records, and each shall
reasonably cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the
Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations
generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-
disclosure and similar agreements with service providers and/or the other
party), and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make reasonably available to the
other party such information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as such party may reasonably request in writing. Each party shall use
reasonable best efforts to minimize any interference with the other partys
regular business operations during any such access. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to properties, books,
contracts, personnel, information technology systems and records, or to
disclose information, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, where such
access or disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, violate or prejudice the rights of Parents or
the Companys customers, result in the disclosure of trade secrets, violate
confidentiality obligations to a third party, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the party in possession or control of such information (after
giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties), unreasonably interfere
with the other partys

 



70

    

 regular business operations during any such access or contravene any Law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or following the date of
this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. In the event that either
party withholds information on the basis of the foregoing, such party shall
inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld,
and the parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply so that such disclosure does not
suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through use of
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent or waiver of any third
party required to provide such information, as applicable.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
Representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated February 2, 2019, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either Parent or the Company or their
respective Representatives, and no information furnished by any of them,
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the other set forth herein.

 

(d) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege, including those
concerning pending or threatened Actions, the parties understand and agree
that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it
is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such
material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way
the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement, and under the common interest doctrine.

 

6.3 _Shareholder Approval and Stockholder Approval_.

 

(a) Parent shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders (the " _Parent Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective (and, in any event, within 30 business
days thereafter) for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Parent Vote
required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the Parent Share
Issuance and, if so desired and mutually agreed in writing, upon other matters
of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
shareholders to approve the issuance of stock in connection with a merger.
Parent shall not postpone the Parent Meeting except to the extent required by
Law or in accordance with the remaining provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.3(a)_. Parent agrees (i) to provide the Company with reasonably detailed
periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis
(including, if requested, promptly providing daily voting reports in the last
ten (10) days prior to the Parent Meeting) and (ii) to give written notice
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be given via e-mail) to the Company
one (1) day prior

 



71

    

 to, and on the date of, the Parent Meeting, indicating whether, as of such
date, sufficient proxies representing the Requisite Parent Vote have been
obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on a date that is two (2)
business days prior to the time for which the Parent Meeting was originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Statement) (the " _Original Parent
Meeting Date_ "), (A) Parent has not received proxies representing the
Requisite Parent Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, (B) there are
insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) and voting to approve the Parent Share Issuance to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Meeting, or (C) it is
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Statement is
delivered, Parent may, or, if the Company so requests, shall, postpone or
adjourn the Parent Meeting; _provided_ that Parent shall only be required to
adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting two (2) times. In the event of any
postponement or adjournment of the Parent Meeting pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 6.3(a)_, Parent has the sole discretion to set the date for the
postponement or adjournment of the Parent Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent
Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) business
days from the Original Parent Meeting Date in connection with the first (1st)
postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty (30) business
days from the Original Parent Meeting Date if the Parent Meeting is postponed
or adjourned for two (2) times. If the Parent Meeting (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Requisite
Parent Vote shall not have been obtained, either Parent or the Company shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.1(h)_. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Parents right or the
Companys right to request Parent to adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Parent Meeting shall be convened
and the Parent Share Issuance shall be submitted to the shareholders of Parent
for approval at the Parent Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve Parent of such obligation (including a Change in Parent
Recommendation).

 

(b) The Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective (and, in any event, within 30 business
days thereafter) for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote
required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired
and mutually agreed in writing, upon other matters of the type customarily
brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to approve the
adoption of a merger agreement. The Company shall not postpone the Company
Meeting except to the extent required by Law or in accordance with the
remaining provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_. The Company agrees (i)
to provide Parent with reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy
solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested, promptly
providing daily voting reports in the last ten (10) days prior to the Company
Meeting) and (ii) to give written notice (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
may be given via e-mail) to Parent one (1) day prior to, and on the date of,
the Company Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date, sufficient proxies
representing the Requisite Company Vote have been obtained. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, on a date that is two (2) business days prior to the time
for which the Company Meeting was originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Joint Statement) (the " _Original Company Meeting Date_ "), (A) the Company
has not received proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or
not a quorum is present, (B) there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to approve the
Merger to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Meeting, or (C) it is necessary to

 



72

    

 ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Statement is delivered,
the Company may, or, if Parent so requests, shall, postpone or adjourn the
Company Meeting; provided that the Company shall only be required to adjourn
or postpone the Company Meeting two (2) times. In the event of any
postponement or adjournment of the Company Meeting pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.3(b)_, the Company has the sole discretion to set the date for the
postponement or adjournment of the Company Meeting; provided that the Company
Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) business
days from the Original Company Meeting Date in connection with the first
(1st) postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty (30)
business days from the Original Company Meeting Date if such Original Company
Meeting Date is postponed or adjourned for two (2) times. If the Company
Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have
concluded and the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained, either
Parent or the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_. For the avoidance of doubt, but
subject to the Companys right or Parents right to request the Company to
adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
6.3(b)_, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, such Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company for approval at the Company
Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company
of such obligation (including a Change in Company Recommendation).

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of Parent or the stockholders of the Company, as
applicable, the Requisite Parent Vote (including by communicating to Parents
shareholders the Parent Recommendation, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.9(g)_), in the case of Parent, or the Requisite Company
Vote (including by communicating to the Companys stockholders the Company
Recommendation, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_ and _Section_ __ _
6.9(g)_), in the case of the Company. Each of the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the date and
time of the Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting to be coordinated such that
they occur within a single period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours (and
in any event as close in time as possible).

6.4 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, in
each case subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) The employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time who continue to remain employed with Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) in the United States and the United
Kingdom (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2020 for so
long as they are employed, be provided with (i) a base salary or base wage and
annual cash incentive opportunity that is no less favorable than the combined
base salary or base wage and annual cash incentive opportunity provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall have the right to adjust any Continuing
Employees base salary or base wage and annual cash incentive opportunity so
long as the aggregate base salary or base wage and annual cash incentive

 



73

    

 opportunity for any such Continuing Employee following any such adjustment
is not less than the aggregate base salary or base wage and annual cash
incentive opportunity for such Continuing Employee in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that in the aggregate
are substantially comparable to such employee benefits, excluding equity,
change in control or retention arrangements, generally made available to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries), as applicable; _provided_ that until such time
as Parent shall cause Continuing Employees to participate in the
employee benefit plans that are made available to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), a Continuing Employees continued participation in employee
benefit plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing
provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the
Parent Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each
Parent Benefit Plan). Following the Effective Time, Parent shall evaluate if
it is materially less favorable, in the aggregate, for the Continuing
Employees to participate in the Parent Benefit Plans as compared to the
Company Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
implement appropriate and reasonable solutions to minimize any such adverse
impact on the Continuing Employees. Further, any Continuing Employee who is
terminated by Parent or one its Subsidiaries without cause following the
Effective Time and prior to December 31, 2020 will receive severance payments
and benefits that are not less favorable than those provided under the
applicable severance/redundancy plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries, subject
to, and in accordance with, the terms of such plan as of the applicable date
of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ shall not apply to Continuing Employees who are
covered by any Company Labor Agreement. As of the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation)
to, as applicable, honor the terms of any Company Labor Agreement.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each Continuing Employee
and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a benefit plan that

coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans for the
plan year in which participation in such Parent Benefit Plan commences, and
(iii) give the Continuing Employees service credit for such Continuing

eligibility and vesting purposes (other than for purposes of any new equity

plan or benefit plan that provides retiree health or welfare benefits, or (D)

confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
that the Company would be permitted to do so by applicable Law, each present
and former (determined as of the Effective Time) director or officer of
the Company and its Subsidiaries when acting in such capacity (collectively,
the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising
before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to, (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as
incurred in connection therewith by such Company Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a
reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is determined in
a final, non-appealable judgment of a Chosen Court that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



75

    

(b) Subject to the following sentence, prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors
and officers insurance policies and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case, for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (the "
_Tail Period_ ") from one (1) or more insurance carriers with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the Merger); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate
annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to be maintained, in
Parents good faith determination, policies of insurance that provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In
lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with, but only upon the
consent of, Parent, may (and, at the request of Parent, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six
(6)-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which a Company Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
Law, contract or otherwise. If required by any written agreement or contract
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall apply to directors, officers, employees and
fiduciaries (in each case, acting in such capacity) of any predecessor entity
previously acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent
required by such written agreement or contract.

 

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not be terminated or modified after the
Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified
Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party.
In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

 

(e) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor
of any Company Indemnified Party as provided in the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws or any organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or
any indemnification agreement between such

 



76

    

 Company Indemnified Party and the Company or a Company Subsidiary, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Effective
Time unchanged and shall not be amended, restated, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Company Indemnified Party.

 

6.7 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise the
other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (a) that
has had or would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) which it believes would or
would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that
reasonably would be expected to give rise, either individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _Article VII_ ; _provided_ that
any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to
any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section_ __
_ 6.7_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or 
_7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by
the party failing to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying
breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied.

6.8 _Corporate Governance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary to
cause:

to cause, effective at the Effective Time, (i) a Company Designated Director,
other than the Company CEO, to be appointed as the Lead Independent Director
of the Parent Board, and (ii) a Company Designated Director to be appointed
to serve on each standing committee of the Parent Board.

(c) Effective at the Effective Time, (i) the Parent CEO shall continue to
serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Parent and Chairman of
the Parent Board, and (ii) the Company CEO shall become an executive of Parent

 the Parent Board and shall serve in such roles until at least the one year
anniversary of the Closing. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
Board shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the persons indicated
in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ to be elected or
appointed to the offices of Parent specified in the first sentence of this

(d) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing, in the event any Company Designated Director

Director_ "), (i) the Company Designated Directors then serving on the Parent
Board may propose up to two (2) individuals to replace such Departing Company
Director and (ii) the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the
Parent Board shall reasonably consider in good faith such individuals
proposed by such Company Designated Directors for inclusion in a slate of
nominees to be presented to the Parent Board or shareholders of Parent, as
applicable.

Company, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall not, and shall cause

solely to clarify whether any such inquiry or offer constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal or (D) enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.9(c)_) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.9(a)_ and _6.9(b)_ , prior to the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by
the shareholders of Parent by the Requisite Parent Vote or the approval of the
Merger and this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company by the Requisite
Company Vote, as applicable, in the event that Parent or the Company, as
applicable, receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal

Company Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith (after

 



78

    

 receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its outside financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries
respective Representatives to furnish, or cause to be furnished, confidential
or nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that the Parent Board or the Company Board, as
applicable, concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and its outside financial advisor) that failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that, prior to providing any confidential or nonpublic information
or data permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(c)_, (i) Parent or the Company, as applicable,
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on

inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of,

and shall promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt) provide to the Company, in the case of Parent, or Parent, in the case
of the Company, copies of all material correspondence and written materials
sent or provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, that describes any terms or conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any material oral
communications addressing such matters). In furtherance of the foregoing,
Parent, in the case of the Company, or the Company, in the case of Parent,
will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt)
notify the Company, in the case of Parent, or Parent, in the case of the
Company, in writing of any related developments, discussions and negotiations
on a current basis (but in no event more than once every twenty-four (24)

party.

 

(e) Subject to _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , if the Parent Board or the Company
Board, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its outside
financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this
Agreement, then such Board may effect a Change in Parent Recommendation or
Change in Company Recommendation, as applicable (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event such Board may communicate the basis for its Change
in Parent Recommendation or Change in Company Recommendation, as applicable,
to Parents shareholders or the Companys stockholders, as applicable, in the
Joint Statement or an appropriate amendment or

 



79

    

 supplement thereto to the extent required by Law; _provided_ that neither
the Parent Board nor the Company Board may effect a Change in Parent
Recommendation or a Change in Company Recommendation, as applicable, unless
(i)(A) Parent or the Company, as applicable, has received an Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote, as applicable, that did
not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ (and such proposal is
not withdrawn) and the Parent Board or the Company Board, as applicable,
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and its outside financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal or (B)(1) in the case of Parent, a Parent Intervening
Event shall have occurred and the Parent Board determines in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and its outside financial
advisor) that continuing to make the Parent Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (2) in the case

Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and its outside financial advisor) that continuing to make the

Board, or the Company gives Parent, in the case of the Company Board, at least
four (4) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action (such period, as it may be extended by delivery of any subsequent
notices, the "notice period") and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including
(A) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of any third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal and any amendment or modification thereof or (B) in the
case of a Parent Intervening Event or a Company Intervening Event, as
applicable, the nature of the Parent Intervening Event or the Company
Intervening Event, as applicable, in reasonable detail) and (iii) at the end
of such notice period, each of the Parent Board and the Company Board, as
applicable, takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by the Company, in the case of the Parent Board (which shall be
negotiated in good faith by Parent and the Company during such period if
requested by the Company), or by Parent, in the case of the Company Board
(which shall be negotiated in good faith by the Company and Parent during such
period if requested by Parent), and after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and its outside financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would nevertheless be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment

for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, except that references to "four (4)
business days" shall be deemed to be references to "two (2) business days."

6.11 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither the Company nor Parent shall take any action
that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to any of the
Transaction Agreements or any related agreement or the Companys ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the
Merger, and each of Parent and the Company shall take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or any
related agreement from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter
in effect to the extent permissible thereunder. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated by
any of the Transaction Agreements or any related agreement, including the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Parent Share
Issuance, each of Parent and the Company will grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary to the extent permissible thereunder so that the
transactions contemplated by such Transaction 

 



83

    

 Agreements or any related agreement, including the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Parent Share Issuance, may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction Agreements.

 

6.12 _Exemption from Liability Under Section_ __ _ 16(b_ _)_. The Company and
Parent agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those
officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to
and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.12_. The Parent Board and the Company Board, or a committee solely of
two or more non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective
Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any
acquisitions or dispositions of Company Class A Common Stock or Company
Equity Awards by Company Insiders and (ii) any acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock or any derivatives thereof, including Parent Equity Awards, by any
Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law.

6.13 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any Action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or threatened in writing against
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates
(other than any negotiations or proceedings in connection with, arising out
of or otherwise related to a demand for appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL, which shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 2.3_) that (a) questions or
would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or
the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to
be taken by Parent, the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
Company and Parent shall give the other party the opportunity to participate,
at such partys own expense, in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors or affiliates or Parent
and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parents or
the Companys, as applicable, prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



84

    

6.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) To the extent that Parent does not have cash currently available that is
sufficient to enable it to consummate the Merger, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
procure and have available, as of the Closing, funds sufficient to pay the
Required Amount. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the
Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (or, if deemed advisable by
Parent, seek a waiver of) all conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter,
(iii) cause the Financing Sources to fund, subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, the Financing on
or before the Closing Date, (iv) negotiate and enter into the definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing (collectively, the " _Debt Documents_
") (and maintain in effect and comply in all material respects with the terms
thereof) on terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or,
if available, on other terms that (1) would not reasonably be expected to
materially delay or adversely affect the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (2) are not less favorable to Parent
than the terms and conditions (including "flex" provisions) described in the
Commitment Letter), which agreements shall be in effect no event later than
the Closing ( _provided_ that, any Debt Documents relating to any bridge
facility shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection with
the funding of the Financing), (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letter and the Debt Documents in the event of a breach by any Financing
Source under the Commitment Letter or Debt Documents relating thereto (it
being understood and agreed that under no circumstances shall this _clause
(v)_ be construed to require Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates to initiate or maintain any Action against any
Financing Source) and (vi) furnish to the Company copies of all executed
material Debt Documents (and, upon the reasonable written request of the
Company, drafts thereof to the extent reasonably practicable). Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment, replacement,
modification or supplement of, or waiver under, the Commitment Letter (it
being understood that the exercise of any "flex" provisions shall not be
deemed to be an amendment, replacement, modification, supplement or waiver)
without the prior written consent of the Company, in each case, which would:
(A) reduce the net cash proceeds of the Financing provided for in the
Commitment Letter (including by changing the amount of fees or original issue
discount contemplated by the Commitment Letter) to an amount such that Parent
will not have available, as of the Closing, funds sufficient to pay the
Required Amount; (B) adversely expand the conditions to the funding of the
Financing beyond those expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, adversely
amend or modify any of such conditions (including by making any such
conditions less likely to be satisfied) or impose any new or additional
condition to the receipt or funding of the Financing at the Closing, in each
case, in a manner that would or would be reasonably likely to make it less
likely that the Financing would be funded or would otherwise prevent,
materially delay or impair the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise adversely affect the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein; or (C) adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against any of the Financing Sources; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub
may amend, supplement or modify the Commitment Letter with respect to "flex"
rights and/or to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents and similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement. Parent shall deliver to the Company true, correct
and complete copies of any amendment, modification, supplement, consent or
waiver to or under the Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable after
execution thereof. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.14_, if any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment

 



85

    

 Letter (after taking into account "flex" provisions), Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing, including
from alternative sources, on terms and conditions (including fees and the
"flex" provisions) not less favorable, taken as a whole, than those set forth
in the Commitment Letter (in the reasonable judgment of Parent), in an amount
such that Parent will have available, as of the Closing, funds sufficient to
pay the Required Amount (" _Alternative Financing_ ") and, for all purposes of
this Agreement, all references to the Financing (including the Financing
Sources) shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing (and the
financial institutions and other entities with respect to such Alternative
Financing) and all references to the Commitment Letter shall include the
applicable commitment documents for the Alternative Financing. Parent shall
provide a true, correct and complete copy of the commitment letter and related
fee letter with respect to any such Alternative Financing to the Company (with
only fee amounts and other economic terms, and the rates and amounts included
in the "flex" provisions, redacted in a customary manner for transactions of
this nature, none of which redacted provisions would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the conditionality, availability, enforceability, termination
or amount of the Financing) as promptly as practicable after execution
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
compliance by Parent with this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_ shall not relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of their obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not the Financing is available.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to
pay any fees to sources of debt in excess of those contemplated by the
Commitment Letter. Parent shall, upon the reasonable written request of the
Company, keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of any material developments in its efforts to arrange the Financing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent, at
Parents sole cost and expense, all cooperation as is reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with arranging, underwriting, obtaining, syndicating and
consummating the Financing, including: (i) as promptly as
reasonably practicable, furnishing Parent and the Financing Parties with (A)
such financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other financial
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type required by
SEC Regulation S-X and SEC Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for
registered offerings of debt securities on a Form S-3 of the type
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, such financial statements to include
(1) audited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of operations,
comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows and related notes thereto
of the Company for the three (3) fiscal years most recently ended at least
sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date (it being acknowledged that Parent
has received such financial statements for the fiscal years of the Company
ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016) and (2)
unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of operations,
comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows and related notes thereto
of the Company for each subsequent fiscal quarter ended at least forty (40)

fiscal year) (it being acknowledged that Parent has received such financial
statements for the fiscal quarters of the Company ended March 31, 2018, June
30, 2018 and September 30, 2018) (other than customary exceptions in the case
of a Rule 144A offering of high-yield debt securities, including, without
limitation, the requirements of Sections 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X, Item
402 of Regulation S-K and information regarding executive compensation), (B)
information regarding

 



86

    

 the Company and its Subsidiaries customarily included in information
memoranda and other syndication materials for bank credit facilities, and (C)
all other historical financial information regarding the Company reasonably
required by Parent to permit Parent to prepare customary pro forma financial
statements to the extent required by SEC rules and regulations or necessary or
reasonably required by Parent or the Financing Sources to be included in any
marketing materials or offering documents or of the type required by the
Commitment Letter (collectively, the " _Required Information_ ") required to
consummate the Financing; _provided_ that, without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall not be obligated to prepare any pro forma financial
information or projections (for which, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent
shall be solely responsible), (ii) making appropriate members of senior
management of the Company available at reasonable times and locations and
upon reasonable prior notice, to participate in a reasonable number of
meetings (including one-on-one meetings or conference calls with Financing
Parties and potential Financing Parties), drafting sessions, presentations,
road shows, rating agency presentations and due diligence sessions and other
syndication activities, (iii) assisting Parent and its Financing Parties in
the preparation of customary and appropriate (A) offering documents, offering
memoranda, offering circulars, private placement memoranda, registration
statements, prospectuses, syndication documents and other
syndication materials, including information memoranda, lender and investor
presentations, bank books and other marketing documents, and similar documents
reasonably required for the Financing and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations, (iv) cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and the
Financing Parties, including, to the extent applicable, obtaining customary
representation and authorization letters and arranging for customary auditor
consents for use of the Required Information and other financial data in the
marketing and offering documentation, including any registration statement
filed with the SEC in connection with the Financing, (v) assisting in
obtaining or updating corporate and facility credit ratings, (vi) using
reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys independent registered
accounting firm and internal and/or external counsel of the Company to provide
assistance to Parent, including in connection with comfort letters and
opinions of counsel to be delivered in connection with the Financing,
including by (A) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys
independent registered accounting firm to provide customary comfort letters
(including "negative assurance" comfort and change period comfort) in
connection with any capital markets transaction comprising a part of the
Financing (including any offering or private placement of debt securities
pursuant to Rule 144A) to the applicable Financing Parties and to participate
in a reasonable number of due diligence sessions and (B) providing customary
back-up certificates, (vii) reasonably cooperating with internal and external
counsel of Parent or any Financing Party in connection with providing back-up
certificates and factual information regarding any legal opinion that such
counsel may be required to deliver in connection with the Financing, (viii)
providing, as promptly as practicable, and in any event at least five (5)
business days prior to the Closing, to the extent requested in writing at
least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing, all documentation and
other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries that any
Financing Party reasonably determines is required by regulatory authorities
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001, and, to the extent
required by any Financing Party, a beneficial ownership certificate
(substantially similar in form and substance to the form of Certification
Regarding Beneficial Owners of Legal Entity Customers published jointly, in
May 2018, by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association and Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association) in respect of any of the Company
or 

 



87

    

 any of its Subsidiaries that qualifies as a "legal entity customer" under
the Beneficial Ownership Regulation (31 C.F.R. § 1010.230), (ix) assisting in
the negotiation and preparation of, and executing and delivering, any credit
agreement, indenture, note, purchase agreement, underwriting agreement, pledge

in connection with the Financing, (x) facilitating Parent to benefit from the
existing lending relationship of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (xi)
informing Parent, as promptly as practicable, if the chief executive officer,
chief financial officer, treasurer or controller of the Company or any member
of the Company Board shall have actual knowledge of any facts as a result of
which a restatement of any financial statements to comply with GAAP is
probable or under active consideration and (xii) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to
permit the consummation of the Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof
to be made available on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, to most
effectively access the financing markets, Parent may require the cooperation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ at any
time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof
and the Closing Date.

 

(c) All documentation prepared by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or any of
their respective Representatives in connection with this  _Section_ __ _
6.14_ shall be subject to the prior review, comment and approval of Parent.

(d) The actions contemplated in this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ with respect to
the Financing shall not (i) require such cooperation from the Company to the
extent it would require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or
their respective Representatives, to incur any monetary liability, pay any
fees, reimburse any expenses, or provide any indemnity, in each case, prior to
the Closing that is not contingent on the Closing or for which Parent is not
obligated to reimburse or indemnify the Company or its Subsidiaries under
this Agreement, or take any actions that would cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to breach this Agreement or become unable to satisfy a condition
to the Closing, (ii) involve any binding commitment or agreement by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives (other than customary authorization and representation letters
and other than other actions by officers or directors continuing employment
with Parent following the Closing that, in the case of such other actions, are
contingent upon the Closing and would not be effective prior to the Closing)
which commitment or agreement is not conditioned on the Closing and does
not terminate without liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of its or their respective Representatives upon the termination of this
Agreement, (iii) require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably
interfere with the operations or business of the Company, (iv) require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives to provide any information the disclosure of which is
prohibited or restricted by applicable Law, (v) require the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to take any action
that will conflict with, or violate, the organizational or governance
documents of such person or any applicable Law or orders or result in the
contravention of, or that could reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any material contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (vi) require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to (A) pass resolutions or consents, approve or
authorize the execution of, or execute any document, agreement, certificate or
instrument or take any other corporate action with respect to the Financing
that is not contingent on the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time or (B) provide or cause its legal counsel to provide any legal
opinions.

 



88

    

(e) Parent (i) will promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with any
cooperation requested by Parent from the Company or its Subsidiaries under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ ( _provided_ that such reimbursement shall not
include general auditor and legal expenses that the Company would have
incurred regardless of whether cooperation was requested pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.14_), (ii) acknowledges and agrees that, except for
obligations from and after the Closing that arise under the definitive
agreements governing the Financing or closing certificates relating to the
Financing, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to, any person
under any arrangement with respect to the Financing that Parent may request
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii)
will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates from and
against any and all losses actually suffered or incurred by any of them of any
type in connection with the arrangement of any Financing and any information
provided or used in connection therewith (other than to the extent suffered,
incurred or arising as a result of (x) information provided by or on behalf of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives in connection with the Financing, (y) a material breach of
this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
affiliates or Representatives or (z) the bad faith, willful misconduct, gross
negligence or fraud of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates or Representatives).

 

(f) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or
disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Companys or its
Subsidiaries reputation or goodwill.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Financing Sources_ " means the parties named in the Commitment Letter
or any joinder agreements thereto (or any similar agreement pursuant to which
the Commitment Letter is modified solely to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had
not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof) (and their
respective successors and permitted assigns) as having committed to provide or
arrange any portion of the Financing; and

 

(ii) " _Financing Parties_ " means the persons (other than Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries) that have committed to provide or arrange any portion of
any Financing or have otherwise entered into agreements in connection with any
Financing or other financing in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder and the parties to any commitment letter, engagement letter, credit
agreement, underwriting agreement, purchase agreement, indenture or other
agreement in connection with the Financing, including any Financing Source,
and any arranger, bookrunner, underwriter, initial purchaser,
placement agent, administrative or collateral agent, trustee or similar
representative in connection with any portion of the Financing, together with,

89

    

6.15 _Transition_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, and in all cases subject to applicable Law, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
during normal business hours, reasonably cooperate with Parent and its
Subsidiaries to facilitate the integration of the parties and their
respective businesses effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as
may be determined by Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
from the date hereof through the Closing Date, and consistent with
the performance of their day-to-day operations and the continuous operation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices, and subject to any requirements under
applicable Law, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
employees and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries to take reasonable
actions and assist Parent in performing all tasks, including providing
assistance with respect to conversion planning and customer communications and
notices (including joint communications and notices relating to anticipated
account changes or systems conversion), reasonably required to result in a
successful transition and integration at the Closing or such later date as may
be determined by Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to take any action under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ if such
action would unduly disrupt the Companys business.

6.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Class A Common Stock
from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Class A Common Stock under
the Exchange Act effective as of immediately following the Effective Time.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to cause the
listing of the Company Class A Common Stock on the standard segment of the
Official List of the FCA and admission to trading of the Company Class A
Common Stock on the main market of the LSE for listed securities to be
cancelled, effective prior to, but in no event later than, the Effective
Time.

6.17 _Employee Cooperation_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, the Company and Parent shall, and subject in all cases to
applicable Law, (a) work together in good faith to identify key employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries (such employees, " _Key Employees_ "), including providing any
information as reasonably requested by Parent or the Company, as applicable,
about individual employees and groups of employees with respect to their
roles, job descriptions, performance, compensation levels, retention risk
factors and other similar information, and (b) to the extent determined by the
parties to be reasonable and appropriate in light of mutual retention and
incentive objectives, cooperate in good faith to help establish and implement
any employee retention and transition incentive programs designed to encourage
the retention and performance of Key Employees.

 



90

    

6.18 _Tax Matters_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that (a) the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b) with respect to the Merger (or any
Alternative Transaction), this Agreement will constitute a "plan
of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. Each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. In the event that Opinion Counsel is not able to deliver the Tax Opinion
with respect to the Merger, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately following the
Merger, merge with and into a newly-formed limited liability company wholly-
owned by Parent and treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, in a transaction described in Revenue Ruling 2001-46, 2001-2
C.B. 321, which, taken together with the Merger, qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) if
necessary or helpful to implement the transactions described in clause (i),
cause a new holding company to acquire the Company (in a transaction that
qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code) prior to the Merger and to participate in the Merger and the transaction
described in clause (i) in lieu of the Company (each of the transaction
described in clause (ii) of this sentence, and the Merger taken together with
the transaction described in clause (i) of this sentence, an " _Alternative
Transaction_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any actions taken pursuant
this sentence (A) shall not (1) without the consent of the Company and Parent,
alter or change the amount, nature or mix of the Merger Consideration or (2)
impose any material incremental economic costs on Parent or the Company or
reduce the anticipated benefits to Parent or the Company of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby in any material respect and (B) shall
be capable of consummation by the Termination Date. Each of the Company and
Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cooperate with one another
and Opinion Counsel in obtaining (x) an opinion of Opinion Counsel, addressed
to the Company and dated as of the Closing Date, substantially to the effect
that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger or any Alternative
Transaction will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code, and (y) any similar opinion to be delivered in connection
with the filing of the S-4 (each, a " _Tax Opinion_ "). In connection
therewith, each of the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (" _Skadden_
"), or another nationally recognized law firm engaged by the Company (together
with Skadden, " _Opinion Counsel_ "), representation letters, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Opinion Counsel. Each such representation
letter shall be dated as of the Closing Date or such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by Opinion Counsel. If Opinion Counsel delivers a Tax
Opinion at the Closing, Parent and the Company shall not, and shall cause
their Subsidiaries not to, take any position inconsistent with the conclusions
of such Tax Opinion on any Tax Return or otherwise for Tax purposes.

 

6.19 _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_. At least two business days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be delivered to Parent a payoff letter required to effect or evidence the
release described in clause (ii) below (the " _Payoff Letter_ "), in customary
form, to be executed and delivered as of the Closing by the administrative
agent (the " _Existing Agent_ ") under the Companys Third Amended and
Restated Loan Agreement dated as of January 16, 2018 (as amended prior to the
date hereof, the " _Existing Credit Agreement_ "), which shall (i) indicate
the total amount necessary for the Company to

 



91

    

 repay and discharge in full all amounts outstanding pursuant to the terms of
the Existing Credit Agreement (other than for customary indemnity and other
contingent obligations that expressly survive by their terms) (such amount,
the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (ii) provide for the release, upon payment of the
Payoff Amount at the Closing (or replacement, cash collateralization or
backstop of existing letters of credit), of all liens of the Existing Agent
securing obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement over the properties
and assets of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (other than any cash
that is used to cash collateralize existing letters of credit, if applicable)
that constitute collateral under the Existing Credit Agreement and any equity
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that constitute collateral
under the Existing Credit Agreement and (iii) evidence the termination
or other satisfaction, upon payment of the Payoff Amount at the Closing (or
replacement, cash collateralization or backstop of existing letters of
credit), of all obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement (other than
for customary indemnity obligations that expressly survive by their terms).
The Company shall deliver (by the applicable date required under the terms of
the Existing Credit Agreement) any notices (including notices of prepayment)
necessary to permit the prepayment, payoff, discharge and termination in full
at the Closing of all indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement on the
Closing Date.

6.20  _Exchange of Class_ __ _ B Units_. The Company shall, or shall cause
one of its Subsidiaries to effect, concurrently with the Closing and effective
immediately prior to the Closing, the mandatory exchange of any
outstanding Class B Units for Company Class A Common Stock, pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) of the Exchange Agreement and the resulting cancellation of the
Class B Units and Class B Common Stock pursuant to Sections 2.1(b) and (c)
of the Exchange Agreement, Section 3.2(a)(1) of the Second Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Worldpay Holding, LLC and
Article IV, Section (3)(e)(3) of the Company Charter.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

 



94

    

(b) by either Parent or the Company if (i) any Governmental Entity required to
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and
such denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final non-appealable
order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger (unless the occurrence of the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or comply with the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein);

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before March 17, 2020 (the " _Initial Termination Date_ ,"
and, as it may be extended below, the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_
that, if, on the Initial Termination Date, any of the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals shall not have been obtained and all of the other conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing), the
Initial Termination Date may be extended by either Parent or the Company
to June 17, 2020 (the " _Extended Termination Date_ ") on written notice to
the other party on or by the Initial Termination Date; _provided_ _further_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the failure of the Closing to occur
by the Initial Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date, as
applicable, shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement or to extend the Termination Date, as applicable, to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein, such
party shall not have the right to seek to terminate this Agreement or to
extend the Termination Date, as applicable;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in
_Article III_ on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by
Parent, or in _Article IV_ on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of
a termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or
failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute,
if occurring or continuing on the date on which the Closing would otherwise
have been required to occur pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ , in the case of
a termination by Parent, or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ , in the case
of a termination by the Company, and which (i) is not cured within the earlier
of (A) the Termination Date and (B) sixty (60) days following written notice
to the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in
the case of a termination by the Company, or (ii) by its nature or timing
cannot be cured;

(e) by Parent prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained,
if the Company Board shall have (i) failed to recommend in the Joint Statement
that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, (ii) effected a
Change in Company Recommendation or (iii) submitted this Agreement to holders
of Company Common Stock for adoption without a recommendation for adoption;

(f) by the Company prior to such time as the Requisite Parent Vote is
obtained, if the Parent Board shall have (i) failed to recommend in the Joint
Statement that the shareholders of Parent approve the Parent Share Issuance,
(ii) effected a Change in Parent Recommendation, or (iii) submitted the
Parent Share Issuance to holders of Parent Common Stock for approval without a
recommendation for approval;

 



95

    

(g) by either Parent or the Company if the Requisite Company Vote shall not
have been obtained by the time that the duly convened Company Meeting
(including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have been
concluded; or

 

(h) by either Parent or the Company if the Requisite Parent Vote shall not
have been obtained by the time that the duly convened Parent
Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have been
concluded.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall give written
notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 9.5_, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected and the basis for such termination, described in
reasonable detail.

8.2  _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of
any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that (i)
_Section 6.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ and this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its intentional fraud
in the making of its representations and warranties in _Article III_ or
_Article IV_ , as applicable, or its willful and material breach (with
actual knowledge, or knowledge that a person acting reasonably under the
circumstances should have, that such partys act or failure to act would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach) of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

(b) __ (i) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to the Company Board or directly to the Companys
stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company, (B) such Acquisition
Proposal shall not have been withdrawn, (C) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated (1) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)_ without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained, (2) by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, as a result
of the Requisite Company Vote not having been obtained, or (3) by Parent
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, and (D) prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into
a definitive agreement providing for, or consummates, a transaction with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of
the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation
of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee
equal to $1,000,000,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that, for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, all references in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%."

 



96

    

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer
of same day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business
days thereafter).

(c) __ (i) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made to the Parent Board or directly to Parents shareholders
generally or any person shall have publicly announced a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Parent, (B) such Acquisition Proposal shall not have
been withdrawn, (C) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (1) by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ without the
Requisite Parent Vote having been obtained, (2) by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h),_ as a result of the Requisite
Parent Vote not having been obtained, or (3) by the Company pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, and (D) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months
after the date of such termination, Parent enters into a definitive agreement
providing for, or consummates, a transaction with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to
above), then Parent shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such
definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay the
Company, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to the Termination
Fee; _provided_ that, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_, all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall
instead refer to "50%."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Company, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of termination (and, in any
event, within three (3) business days thereafter).

(d) The parties hereby agree that, if payable, the Termination Fee shall
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is
payable, receipt of the Termination Fee by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for damages against the
other party and the Financing Parties for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated, except in the circumstances set forth in clause (ii) of the
proviso set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_. In no event shall either the
Company or Parent, as applicable, be obligated to pay more than one (1)
Termination Fee.

(e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either Parent or
the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.2_ when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, commences a suit which results in a final, non-
appealable judgment of a Chosen Court against Parent or the Company, as
applicable, for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Parent or the
Company, as applicable, shall (i) pay the costs and expenses of the Company
or Parent, as applicable (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses),
in

 



97

    

 connection with such suit and (ii) pay interest on any overdue amounts (for
the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on
which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of
the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The
parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 8.2_ shall be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under
_Section_ __ _ 9.13_.

be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards, as applicable, at any time before or after approval of the

approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the shareholders of Parent or the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, there may not
be, without further approval of such shareholders or stockholders, as
applicable, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further shareholder
or stockholder approval under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct
or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as
an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties and duly approved

 hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a

9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware (except that matters relating to the fiduciary duties of
the Parent Board shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Georgia).

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware) (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection
with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue
in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any
objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not
have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon
such party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is
given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.5_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party
hereto acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that all claims or causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
involving any of the Financing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Financing, the
Commitment Letter or any other agreement relating to the Financing, or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict of law principles
thereof to the extent that such principles would have the effect of applying
the laws of, or directing a matter to, another jurisdiction, and each party
agrees not to bring or support, or permit any of its affiliates to bring or
support, any person in any action of any kind or description, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any of
the Financing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Financing, the Commitment Letter or any
other agreement relating to the Financing, or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New
York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New
York, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court.

9.12 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise, other than,
following the Closing, by operation of law in a merger) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in
contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, which is
intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and _Section_ __ _ 9.16_, which is intended to benefit each
Company Party to the extent set forth therein, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to and does not
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein.

 



103

    

 The representations and warranties in this Agreement are qualified by
disclosures set forth in public filings and the applicable disclosure schedule
and are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the
sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith
without notice or liability to any other person. Persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _
6.6_ and the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement
of any third party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
Financing Parties shall be an express third-party beneficiary of and shall be
entitled to rely on  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_, the last sentence of _Section_
__ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)_, this sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.16_ and each of the
Financing Parties may enforce such provisions. No assignment or purported
assignment of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be valid if and to the
extent such assignment adversely affects the treatment of the Merger under
Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

9.14  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.15 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
executed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery
of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

 



104

    

9.16 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered
contemporaneously herewith, in no event shall any Financing Party have any
liability or obligation to, or be subject to any action, suit, proceeding or
claim from the Company, its affiliates, or its or its affiliates respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, controlling persons, agents or Representatives (collectively, the "
_Company Parties_ ") in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, any Financing or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of Company Parties will have any
rights or claims against any Financing Party (solely in its capacity as a
Financing Party) under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by,
or entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement, including any commitments by the Financing Parties in respect of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
