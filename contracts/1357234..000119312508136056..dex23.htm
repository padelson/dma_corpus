any claims related thereto, in the case of Buyer and the Target Companies and
(y) the Non-PBM Business or any claims related thereto in the case of Seller
and Group, whether or not the privileged information is in the possession of
or under the control of the parties that control the assertion or waiver of
such privileges; _provided_ , _however_ , that from and after the Closing,
neither the Buyer nor the Company will waive, and each will cause the other
Target Companies not to waive, any privilege attaching as a result of legal
counsel representing prior to the Closing any Target Company in connection
with this transaction without the prior written consent of the Seller. In
addition, the Buyer hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause the
Target Companies to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with (a)
such counsel representing the Seller after the Closing and (b)
the communication by such counsel to the Seller, in any such representation,
of any fact known to such counsel, in each case including in connection with
(x) a dispute with the Buyer, or any of its Affiliates following the Closing
or (y) the defense of any Third Party Claim giving rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder by the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

8.7.2. _Shared Privilege_. The parties agree that they shall have a shared
privilege, with equal right to assert or waive, subject to the restrictions in
this Section 8.7, with respect to all privileges not allocated pursuant to
the terms of Section 8.7.1.  



 

-40-  Except as provided in Section 8.7.3, no party may waive any privilege that
could be asserted under any applicable Law and in which another party has
a shared privilege without obtaining the prior written consent of the other
party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

8.7.3. _Disputes_. In the event of any action, suit, claim, investigation or
proceeding between or among any of the parties, Buyer and the Company, on the
one hand, or Seller and Group, on the other hand, may waive a privilege in
which the other has a shared privilege, without obtaining consent; provided,
that such waiver of a shared privilege shall be effective only as to the use
of information with respect to the action, suit, claim, investigation
or proceeding between the parties and shall not operate as a waiver of the
shared privilege with respect to third parties.

8.8. _Employees_.

8.8.1. _WARN Act_. Seller, its Affiliates and the Target Companies shall not,
at any time ninety (90) days before the Closing Date, without complying fully
with the notice requirements and other requirements of the WARN Act and any
similar, state, local or foreign Law, effectuate (i) a plant closing as
defined in the WARN Act or similar, state, local or foreign Law, affecting
any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any
site of employment of any Target Company; or (ii) a mass layoff as defined in
the WARN Act or similar, state, local or foreign Law affecting any site of
employment of any Target Company. On or before the Closing Date, the Seller
and/or the Company shall provide a list of the name and site of employment of
any and all employees of any Target Company who have experienced, or will
experience, an employment loss or layoff  as defined by the WARN Act or any
similar state, local or foreign Law within ninety (90) days prior to the
Closing Date. The Company shall update this list up to and including the
Closing Date.

8.8.2. _Employment of Affected Employees_. For a period of one year following
the Closing Date, the Buyer will cause the Target Companies to continue to
employ each of the Affected Employees from and after the Closing Date in a
position, and with compensation, benefits and other terms and conditions of
employment, which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
being provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the above, nothing set forth in this Section 8.8.2 will
create a contract of employment with, or for the benefit of, any Affected
Employee, or change such employees status as an employee at will, or restrict
the ability of the Buyer to terminate the employment of, or change the
position or title of, any such employee; provided, however, that Buyer shall
not cause any employment loss within 90 days following the Closing Date that
would result in any obligation by the Seller to have provided notice pursuant
to the WARN Act or similar state, local or foreign Law to any employee of
the Target Companies.

8.8.3. _No Third-Party Rights_. No provision of this Section 8.8 will create
any third-party beneficiary rights in any Affected Employee or other Person
(including any heir, beneficiary, executor, administrator or representative of
an Affected Employee or any other Person claiming through an Affected
Employee) or any Target Company with respect to employment or any term or
condition thereof.



 

-41- 8.8.4. _280G_. The Seller shall seek shareholder approvals for payments
potentially subject to Section 280G of the Code (which determination shall be
made jointly by the Seller and Buyer using reasonable interpretation of
applicable documents and Laws, including the Code and applicable guidance
thereunder, and data furnished by the Seller), and prior to sending materials
to shareholders, the Seller shall first provide Buyer with copies of all such
materials and shall subsequently consult with Buyer as to the content of such
materials and the process to be used for obtaining such shareholder approvals
to ensure that any such shareholder approvals would be valid under Section
280G of the Code and regulations thereunder.

8.9. _Tax Matters_.

8.9.1. _Tax Returns_.

(a) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, in a manner consistent with past practice (except as otherwise required
by Law or to the extent necessary to appropriately reflect the amount of net
operating losses adjusted on account of cancellation of indebtedness income
incurred in connection with the transactions giving rise to the item set forth
in Section 3.7.1(f) of the Disclosure Schedules) all consolidated, unitary or
combined income Tax Returns of the Seller that include the operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Consolidated Returns_ "). The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall furnish Tax information to Seller for
inclusion in any Consolidated Return for the period that includes the Closing
Date in accordance with the Companys past custom and practice. Buyer shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to furnish the information to Seller as
reasonably requested by Seller to allow Seller to satisfy its obligations
under this Section 8.9.1. The income of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be apportioned to the period up to and including the Closing Date and
the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the end of the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury
Regulations section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i). Buyer and Seller agree that any income
or gain attributable to the Non-PBM Business Distribution will be treated for
all Tax purposes as allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and will be
reported on Sellers Consolidated Tax Return for the Taxable year which
includes the sale of the Shares and will not be reported on the Consolidated
Returns which include the Buyer or any separate federal income Tax Return of
the Company. Buyer agrees not to cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to engage in any transactions not in the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date after Buyers purchase of the Shares (and will indemnify Seller
for any additional Tax owed by Seller as a result of any such transactions).



 

-42- (b) Seller shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax
Returns (other than Consolidated Returns, which are the subject of Section
8.9.1(a) above) with the appropriate federal, state, local and other Tax
authorities relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax Periods
ending on or before the Closing Date and shall pay all Taxes due with respect
to such Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and the
Subsidiaries relating to Straddle Periods and shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon; provided that Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for the portion of such Taxes related to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, calculated in accordance with
the provisions of Section 8.9.2(b). Buyer shall provide such Tax Returns to
the Seller in draft form at least thirty (30) days before the due date of such
Tax Returns and shall allow Seller to review, comment upon and
reasonably approve such Tax Returns. To the extent consistent with applicable
Law, Buyer and Seller agree to cause the Company to file all Tax Returns for
any Straddle Period on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, unless the relevant Tax authority
will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis.

(c) With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall not make any
elections or file (or cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary to file)
any amended Tax Return without Sellers written consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. With respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, upon Sellers request and at Sellers expense, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, initiate a
claim for refund or amend any Tax Return;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall not be required to initiate such a claim for refund or amendment
if it can reasonably be expected that such claim for refund or amendment would
increase the liability for Tax of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Buyer for the Straddle Period or Post-Closing Tax Period beginning after the
Closing Date.

(d)  _Consolidated Return Disputes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Seller shall have the exclusive right to
control all matters (including audits and other disputes) relating to a
Consolidated Return of the Seller; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall
not unreasonably consent to the entry of any judgment or unreasonably enter
into any compromise or settlement with respect to a Consolidated Return of the
Seller to the extent that such judgment, compromise, or settlement could
reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on a Target Company
after the Closing Date.



 

-43- 8.9.2. _Tax Indemnification; Allocation Matters_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller and Group, jointly and severally, agree
to indemnify, save and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and
against all Losses with respect to (i) Taxes of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Taxes
incurred in connection with the Non-PBM Business Distribution), (ii) the
breach of any covenants in this Section 8.9, (iii) Taxes imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of being a member of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group on or prior to the Closing
Date, by reason of the liability of any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any
predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision), (iv)
any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.7 (to
the extent not indemnifiable pursuant to clauses (i),(ii) or (iii) above).

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period:

(1) real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date that are levied on a per diem basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ ")
shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period; and

(2) the Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Per Diem
Taxes) for any Straddle Period shall be computed as if such Straddle Period
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(c) The Seller shall include the income of the Company (including any
deferred intercompany items described in Treasury Regulations section
1.1502-13 and any excess loss accounts taken into income under Treasury
Regulations section 1.1502-19) for periods through the end of the Closing
Date in the Consolidated Returns and shall pay any federal income Taxes
attributable to such income.

8.9.3.  _Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_.

(a) If an audit, examination, inquiry or other claim shall be made by any
Tax authority which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment
pursuant to Section 8.9.2(a), or if a party otherwise wishes to assert a claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.9.2(a) (each a " _Tax Claim_ "),
the indemnified parties shall deliver written notice, specifying the basis
for and amount (if known) of the claim asserted, to the other party within
five (5) days of the date such Tax Claim becomes known; provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying parties have been prejudiced
as a result of such failure.



 

-44- (b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller
shall have the exclusive right, at its own expense, to control all
proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax
Claim, including all decisions to grant or deny any waiver or extension of the
applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any Tax Claim that could materially adversely
affect the liability for Taxes of Buyer or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period to any extent (including the
imposition of income tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost
adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the
denial of amortization or depreciation deductions, the reduction of loss or
credit carry forwards, or the agreement of any change in the basis of transfer
pricing between any of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any other Person
whether unilaterally or bilaterally under any form of mutual agreement
procedure or similar) without the prior written consent of Buyer. Such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall not be necessary to the extent
that Seller has indemnified Buyer against the effects of any such settlement.
Seller and Buyer shall jointly control all Proceedings with respect to any Tax
Claim relating to any Straddle Period. A party shall promptly notify the other
party if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim
which it is entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement, and the other
party shall thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding. The
parties shall cooperate with each other in contesting any Tax Claim under
this Section 8.9.3(b), which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon
request of Seller, the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim and making employees available to
provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

(c) The parties shall satisfy their indemnity obligations pursuant to Section
8.9 within ten (10) days after a final determination (within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code) of the relevant Tax is made. Any payment
obligations of Seller in respect of claims pursuant to this Section 8.9 shall
be satisfied: (1) first, from the Escrow Amount and to the extent thereof and
(2) second, by wire transfer to the Buyer of immediately available funds from
the Seller.

8.9.4. _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax-sharing agreement or similar
arrangement between the Seller or any Affiliate of Seller that is not the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on the other hand, will be terminated as of the Closing Date
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any rights
or obligations following the Closing under any such terminated agreement.



 

-45- 8.9.5. _Coordination; Survival._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, all matters relating to indemnification for Taxes shall be
governed solely by this Section 8.9, and in the event of any conflict between
the provisions of this Section 8.9 and any other provision in this Agreement,
this Section 8.9 shall control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the representations contained in Section 3.7 shall survive
until ninety (90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and all other indemnification provisions (and obligations)
contained in this Section 8.9 shall survive indefinitely unless otherwise
expressly specified in Section 8.9.

8.9.6. _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller each agree to pay fifty percent
(50%) of any sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary, filing, recording,
stock transfer or like Taxes including any interest and penalties in
connection with the acquisition of the Shares by Buyer pursuant to Section
2.1.1(b) and Section 2.1.1(c) of this Agreement (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, does not include any actions taken in connection with the Non-PBM
Business Contribution and the Non-PBM Business Distribution), and Buyer and/or
Seller (as appropriate) shall file all Tax Returns in connection therewith.

8.9.7. _Post-Closing Elections_. At Sellers request, Buyer shall cause (at
Sellers request) any of the Company and its Subsidiaries to make or join
with Seller in making any Tax-related election if the making of such election
could not reasonably be likely to have an adverse impact on Buyer (or any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries) for any Tax period after the Closing Date.

8.9.8. _No Section 338 or Section 338(h)(10) Elections_. No election under
section 338 of the Code or section 338(h)(10) of the Code shall be made by
any party with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares.

8.9.9. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Each party hereto will cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party hereto in
connection with preparation, filing and execution of Tax Returns and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (including any
Tax Claim). Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder or
to testify at any such proceeding. Seller and the Buyer agree (i) to retain
all books and records in their possession on the Closing Date with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
any Tax Period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or
Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax Periods, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority, and (ii)
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, Seller or  



 

-46-  the Buyer, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon
request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Tax authority or any other Person or take any other
action as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed on any party (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

8.9.10. _Limitations on Indemnification_. The aggregate liability of the
Seller and Group under this Section 8.9 shall not be subject to any cap.

8.9.11.  _Recourse to Escrow Amount_. Consistent with Section 9.7.2 below,
with respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.9, the
obligation to make payment to any Buyer Indemnified Party shall be satisfied:
(x) first, from the remaining Escrow Amount and to the extent thereof and (y)
second, from the Seller or Group by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to Buyer.

8.9.12. _Calculation of Losses_. The provisions of Section 9.4.3 shall apply
for the purposes of determining the amount of Losses subject to
indemnification under this Section 8.9.

8.10. _Transfer of Non-PBM Business_.

8.10.1. It is the intent of the parties hereto that, to the extent
practicable, the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Target Companies),
including Group, retain or assume, as the case may be, the economic and legal
rights and obligations and all liabilities, as applicable, to the Non-PBM
Business.

8.10.2. The Seller will cause the Company and Group to consummate the Non-PBM
Contribution prior to the Closing and the Non-PBM Distribution at the
Closing, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement
(including pursuant to the steps described on Exhibit A thereto) and any
additional documents necessary or appropriate in connection therewith, on
terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; provided, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that
the disposition of the Non-PBM Business is structured as a spin-off,
distribution, dividend or similar transaction, (x) after giving effect to
such transaction, Group shall be solvent and adequately capitalized and (y)
such spin-off, distribution, dividend or similar transaction shall be in
compliance with and not in violation of any applicable subsections of Section
607.06401 of the Florida Business Corporations Act. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company, the Seller and the Buyer
shall cooperate and consult with each other in preparation of material
documentation relating to the Non-PBM Contribution and the Non-PBM
Distribution and (a) the Buyer shall have an opportunity to review and comment
on any such documentation and (b) the Company and the Seller shall not (1)
enter into any material agreements or arrangements concerning, or take any
material actions with respect to, the Non-PBM Contribution and the Non-PBM
Distribution (other than those agreements, arrangements and actions expressly
contemplated by the terms of the Restructuring Agreement) or (2) amend or
modify the Restructuring Agreement or waive compliance with any provision of
the Restructuring Agreement, in each case, without the prior written consent
of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



 

-47- 8.10.3. On and after the Closing Date, to the extent any asset primarily
related to, or liability, to the extent related to, the Non-PBM Business is
not contributed to and/or assumed by, as the case may be, Group prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Target Companies to, pursuant to the
Restructuring Agreement, cooperate with the Seller and Group to take such
actions and enter into such arrangements reasonable and lawful as to Buyer,
the Target Companies and Seller as the Seller may reasonably request (but in
each case without any obligation to make payments or incur any liabilities to
any other Person), in order to transfer economic and legal rights and
obligations under the Non-PBM Business asset or liability to Group or its
Affiliates.

8.10.4. On and prior to the one year anniversary of the Closing Date, if Buyer
owns any asset that was not an asset transferred pursuant to the Non-PBM
Contribution that Buyer and Seller in their good faith judgment mutually agree
is an asset that more properly belongs to the Seller, Group or their
Affiliates, or is an asset that Seller and the Target Companies intended Group
to have the right to continue to use (except for any assets made available to
Seller pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement), then Buyer and the
Target Companies and Group shall, pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring
Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer such asset to
Group or its Affiliates or grant such mutually agreeable rights with respect
to such asset to permit the continued use thereof without any liability on the
part of any Target Company or their Affiliates (subject to the terms of the
Restructuring Agreement).

8.10.5. On and prior to the one year anniversary of the Closing Date, if
Group owns any asset that was an asset transferred pursuant to the Non-PBM
Contribution that Buyer and Seller in their good faith judgment mutually agree
is an asset that more properly belongs to the Target Companies or their
Affiliates, or is an asset that the Target Companies and Seller intended the
Target Companies to have the right to continue to use (except for any assets
made available to Buyer and the Target Companies pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement), then Seller and the Target Companies and Group shall,
pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, use commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer such asset to the Target Companies or their
Affiliates or grant such mutually agreeable rights with respect to such asset
to permit such continued use without any liability on the part of Group or the
Seller (subject to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement).

8.11. _Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation_.

8.11.1. For a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, neither the
Seller nor any of its Affiliates under common control with the Seller will
engage directly or indirectly (or hold any equity interest in any Person that
engages directly or indirectly) in all or any portion of the Business as
conducted as of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that (a) no  



 

-48-  owner of less than 5% of the outstanding stock of any publicly-traded
corporation shall be deemed to be so engaged solely by reason thereof and (b)
this Section 8.11 shall not in any manner limit, restrict or otherwise
preclude the Seller, Group and their Affiliates from continuing after the
Closing to operate the Non-PBM Business as such business exists immediately
following the Closing and in any other manner that is not competitive with
the Business. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Section 8.11
shall be deemed to restrict or otherwise impair the Seller, Group and their
Affiliates from engaging in such Non-PBM Business following the Closing.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, nothing set
forth in this Section 8.11: (i) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the
Seller or its Affiliates from acquiring an interest, by joint venture, merger,
stock purchase, asset purchase or other business purchase or combination in a
business (the " _Acquired Business_ ") that either operates a business that
is competitive with the Business or has an approved business plan to develop a
business that is competitive with the Business (a " _Competitive Business_ ")
so long as the aggregate revenues derived by the Competitive Business
included in the Acquired Business during the four (4) most recently completed
fiscal quarters for such Acquired Business prior to the date on which the
definitive agreement for the acquisition of the Acquired Business is entered
into do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the aggregate consolidated revenues of
the Seller on a pro forma basis for such four fiscal quarters.

8.11.2. For a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, the Seller
will not, directly or indirectly, recruit, offer employment, solicit, employ
or engage as a consultant any Person who is an employee of any Target Company
to leave the employ of the Target Companies; provided that general
solicitations by newspaper or other public media or non-directed third-party
search firm shall not be deemed "solicitations" prohibited by the foregoing;
provided further that Seller may recruit, offer employment, solicit, employ or
engage as a consultant any employees who are terminated by the Buyer (so long
as Seller has not breached its obligations hereunder prior to such
termination).

8.11.3. For a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer
will not, directly or indirectly, recruit, offer employment, solicit, employ
or engage as a consultant any Person who is an employee of Seller, Group or
any of their Subsidiaries, to leave the employ of Seller, Group or any of
their Subsidiaries, as applicable; provided that general solicitations by
newspaper or other public media or non-directed third-party search firm shall
not be deemed "solicitations" prohibited by the foregoing; provided further
that Buyer may recruit, offer employment, solicit, employ or engage as a
consultant any employees who are terminated by the Seller, Group or any of
their Subsidiaries (so long as Buyer has not breached its obligations
hereunder prior to such termination). 



 

-49- 8.11.4. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares
that any term or provision of this Section 8.11 is invalid or unenforceable,
the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity
or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

8.12. _License to Retained Names and Marks_. Effective as of the Closing,
Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to Buyer and its
Affiliates, for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing, a non-
exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free license to use the Retained Names and
Marks to facilitate the transition by Buyer and its Affiliates to new names
and marks. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, Buyer and
its Affiliates shall phase-out use of the Retained Names and Marks. All
goodwill associated with the Retained Names and Marks generated by Buyer or
its Affiliates use of the Retained Names and Marks pursuant to the foregoing
license in this Section 8.12 shall inure to the benefit of Seller and its
Affiliates. Buyer and its Affiliates shall use the Retained Names and Marks at
a level of quality equivalent in all material respects to that in effect for
the Retained Names and Marks as of the Closing. For purposes of clarity,
nothing in this Section 8.12 shall preclude any uses of the Retained Names and
Marks by Buyer and its Affiliates that are (i) required by applicable Law, or
(ii) otherwise not prohibited under applicable Law.

8.13. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

8.13.1. Prior to the Closing, the Company and Seller, as applicable, shall
give prompt written notice to the Buyer of any matters, events or occurrences
first arising after the date of this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to cause any representation or warranty of the Target Companies or
the Seller, as applicable, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing,
assuming such representation or warranty is made at such time. For purposes of
determining whether the Seller is subject to any claim for indemnification
under Section 9, unless such matters, events or occurrences would, together
with all similar matters, events or occurrences not notified to Buyer,
otherwise result in the failure of a condition precedent to the Buyers
obligation to close pursuant to Section 6, such written notice shall be
deemed to cure the breach of any such representation or warranty and amend/or
supplement the Disclosure Schedules related to such representation or
warranty; _provided_ that if such matters, events or occurrences
would otherwise result in the failure of a condition precedent to the Buyers
obligation to close pursuant to Section 6 and notwithstanding such failure,
Buyer consummates the Closing, such written notice shall be deemed to cure the
breach (but only to the extent relating to the matter so disclosed pursuant
to the above) of any such representation or warranty and amend/or supplement
the Disclosure Schedules related to such representation or warranty.



 

-50- 8.13.2. Prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall give prompt written notice to
the Company and the Seller of any matters, events or occurrences first
arising after the date of this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to
cause any representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the date of this Agreement to the
Closing assuming such representation or warranty is made at such time. For
purposes of determining whether the Buyer is subject to any claim for
indemnification under Section 9, unless such matters, events or occurrences
would, together with all similar matters, events or occurrences not notified
to the Company and the Seller, otherwise result in the failure of a condition
precedent to the Companys and the Sellers obligation to close pursuant to
Section 7, such written notice shall be deemed to cure the breach of any such
representation or warranty and amend/or supplement the Disclosure Schedules
related to such representation or warranty; _provided_ that if such matters,
events or occurrences would otherwise result in the failure of a condition
precedent to the Sellers obligation to close pursuant to Section 7 and
notwithstanding such failure, Seller consummates the Closing, such written
notice shall be deemed to cure the breach (but only to the extent relating to
the matter so disclosed pursuant to the above) of any such representation or
warranty and amend/or supplement the Disclosure Schedules related to such
representation or warranty.

9.1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Indemnities_.
Other than with respect to matters relating to Taxes, which shall be governed
solely by Section 8.9, no claim may be made or suit or other proceeding
instituted seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 and 9.3 unless a
written notice describing the matter subject to indemnification in reasonable
detail in light of the circumstances then known to the Indemnified Party is
provided to the Indemnifying Party at any time prior to the expiration of the
period ending on the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
except for claims made pursuant to Section 9.2.3 or Section 9.2.4 or
with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1
(Power and Authorization), 3.2 (Organization), 3.3 (Capitalization and
Subsidiaries), 3.18 (Brokers), 4.1 (Seller Organization, Power and Standing),
4.2 (Seller Authorization), 4.3 (Title to Shares), 4.5 (Brokers), 5.1 (Buyer
Organization), 5.2 (Buyer Authorization) and 5.6 (Brokers) (collectively, the
" _Fundamental Representations_ ") and any claim based on fraud, which, in
each case, will survive (and notice may be given) indefinitely.

9.2. _Indemnity by the Seller and Group_. From and after the Closing, subject
to this Section 9, and other than with respect to matters relating to Taxes,
which shall be governed solely by Section 8.9, the Buyer and each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") will be indemnified and held harmless by the
Seller and Group, jointly and severally, from, against and in respect of any
of the following: 

9.2.1. Losses incurred as a result of any breach or default in performance by
the Company or the Seller of any covenant or agreement of the Company or the
Seller contained in this Agreement;

9.2.2. Losses incurred as a result of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty made as of the Closing Date, as if made on the
Closing Date, by the Company or the Seller in this Agreement;

9.2.3. Losses that do not arise out of or relate to the Business (including
(a) with respect to the Transferred Group Assets and the Transferred Group
Liabilities (in each case, as defined in the restructuring Agreement) and (b)
to the extent related to the Non-PBM Business); or

9.2.4. Losses arising out of the transactions contemplated by the Non-PBM
Business Contribution and the Non-PBM Business Distribution.

The applicable Buyer Indemnified Party will provide the Seller and Group with
a prompt, detailed written notice for any claim made in respect of the
indemnification provided in this Section 9.2, whether or not arising out of a
claim by a third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of
the Buyer Indemnified Party in notifying the Seller and Group will relieve the
Seller or Group from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the
extent) the Seller and Group are prejudiced by such delay.



 

-52- 9.3. _Indemnity by the Buyer_. Subject to this Section 9, and other than
with respect to matters relating to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by
Section 8.9, the Seller and its respective directors, officers, shareholders,
distributees, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") will be indemnified and held harmless by the
Buyer from, against and in respect of all Losses by the Buyer resulting from:

9.3.1. any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made as
of the Closing Date, as if made on the Closing Date by Buyer in this
Agreement;

9.3.2. any breach or nonfulfillment by Buyer of, or any noncompliance by the
Buyer with, any covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein; and

9.3.3. any claims under WARN or under any similar state, local or foreign Law
with respect to a plant closing, layoff or relocation or with respect to any
obligation to provide notice, payment or any other benefit as a result of or
arising out of any termination of employment of any Affected Employee
effectuated by Buyer after the Closing.

The applicable Seller Indemnified Party will provide the Buyer with a prompt,
detailed written notice for any claim made in respect of the indemnification
provided in this Section 9.3 whether or not arising out of a claim by a third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Seller
Indemnified Party in notifying the Buyer will relieve the Buyer from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Buyer is
actually and materially prejudiced by such delay.

9.4. _Limitations on Indemnity_.

9.4.1. _Limitations on Indemnity by the Seller and Group_.

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party will assert any claim for indemnification under
Section 9.2.2: (i) in respect of any individual Loss or series of related
Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Party, unless such Loss
or series of related Losses exceeds $30,000 and (ii) and until such time as
the aggregate of all Losses exceeding $30,000 that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may have under Section 9.2.2 exceeds $2,500,000 (the " _Indemnity
Deductible_ "), and then only for the amount by which such claims exceed the
Indemnity Deductible.

(b) The aggregate liability of the Seller and Group in respect of claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2.2 will not exceed $30,000,000 (the "
_Cap_ ").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Indemnity
Deductible and Cap and other provisions of this Section 9.4.1 will not apply
to obligations of the Seller and Group herein to indemnify Buyer Indemnified
Parties in connection with a breach of a  



 

-53-  Fundamental Representation or obligations to indemnify pursuant to Section
9.2.1, Section 9.2.3 or Section 9.2.4 or obligations to indemnity in respect
of Taxes, which shall be solely governed by Section 8.9; provided that if the
aggregate amount of payments made by Seller and Group to Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Sections 9.2 and 8.9 exceeds the Cash Share
Consideration., no further claims may be made by Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 9 but may be made pursuant to Section 8.9. By way of
example, if the aggregate amount of payments made by Seller and Group pursuant
to this Section 9 and/or Section 8.9 were at any time equal to the Cash Share
Consideration, then, from and after such time, neither Seller nor Group would
be liable to make any additional payments in respect of claims made pursuant
to this Section 9, but Buyers right to recover amounts from Seller and Group
pursuant to, and under the provisions of, Section 8.9 shall be unaffected and
Seller and Group shall remain liable to make payments in respect of claims
made pursuant to Section 8.9.

9.4.2. _Limitations on Indemnity by the Buyer_.

(a) No Seller Indemnified Party will assert any claim for indemnification
under Section 9.3: (i) in respect of any individual Loss or series of related
Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Party, unless such Loss
or series of related Losses exceeds $30,000 and (ii) and until such time as
the aggregate of all Losses exceeding $30,000 that the Seller Indemnified
Parties may have under Section 9.3.1 exceeds the Indemnity Deductible, and
then only for the amount by which such claims exceed the Indemnity Deductible.

(b) In no event will the Buyer be obligated to indemnify any Seller
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim for indemnification under Section
9.3.1 for amounts in excess of the Cap.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Indemnity
Deductible and Cap and the other provisions of this Section 9.4.2 will not
apply to obligations of the Buyer herein to indemnify Seller Indemnified
Parties in connection with a breach of a Fundamental Representation or
obligations to indemnify in respect of Taxes, which shall be solely governed
by Section 8.9.

9.4.3. _Calculation of Losses_. For purposes of determining the amount of any
Losses subject to indemnification under this Section 9, the amount of such
Losses will be determined net of (a) all related reserves properly accrued and
directly related to the specific matter subject of indemnification on
the Financial Statements and (b) the difference of (i) any amounts recovered
by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss
_minus_ (ii) the total of the cost of such recovery and the expected
increased cost of premiums for the insurance policy under which the
Indemnified Party recovered, and (c) any Tax Benefit Actually Realized, which
Tax Benefit is solely attributable to such Loss. If an Indemnified Party
Actually Realizes a Tax Benefit solely attributable to a Loss at any time
subsequent to any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 8.9 or this
Section 9, then such Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party
within ten (10) days for any payment made or expense incurred by such party
in connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount actually
received by such Indemnified Party.



 

-54- 9.4.4. _Materiality_. For purposes of this Section 9 only, a breach of
a representation or warranty shall be deemed to exist either if such
representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached or would have
been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty had not
contained any limitation or qualification as to "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect" (which instead shall be read as any adverse effect or change)
or similar language and the amount of Losses in respect of any breach of
representation or warranty, including any deemed breach pursuant to this
clause shall be determined without regard to any such limitation or
qualification as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect" (which instead
shall be read as any adverse effect or change) or similar language set forth
in such representation or warranty.

9.5. _Matters Involving Third Parties_. 

9.5.1. If any third party notifies any party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that may give rise to
claim for indemnification against any other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") under this Section 9, then the Indemnified Party will promptly notify each
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; _provided, however_ , that no delay on
the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then
solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.

9.5.2. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (1) the Third Party Claim
involves primarily money damages and (2) the Indemnifying Party conducts the
defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently.

9.5.3. So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the
Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.5.2 above, (a) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expenses and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (b) the Indemnified Party
will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim, nor take any voluntary action
prejudicial to the determination of the Third Party Claim, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and (c) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
unless written agreement is obtained releasing the Indemnified Party subject
to the Third Party claim from all liability thereunder.

9.5.4. If and for so long as any condition in this Section 9.5 is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the
Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified
Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, any Indemnifying
Party in connection therewith).



 

-55- 9.6. _Tax Treatment_. The Buyer and the Seller will treat any payment
received pursuant to Section 8.9 or this Section 9 as an adjustment to
purchase price for Tax and financial reporting purposes.

9.7. _Certain Other Indemnity Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

9.7.1. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, other than for fraud, following the Closing, indemnification
pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 8.9 and this Section 9
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and
the Seller Indemnified Parties for any liability arising under this Agreement,
and, except as set forth in any Ancillary Agreement, the Contemplated
Transactions, including for misrepresentation or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; provided, however,
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit, waive or
restrict any partys rights, claims or causes of action such party may have
pursuant to the terms of an Ancillary Agreement.

9.7.2. _Recourse to Escrow Amount_. With respect to claims for indemnification
pursuant to Sections 8.9, 9.2.1, 9.2.2, 9.2.3 and 9.2.4, the obligation to
make payment to any Buyer Indemnified Party shall be satisfied: (x) first,
from the remaining Escrow Amount and to the extent thereof and (y) second,
from the Seller or Group by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
Buyer.

9.7.3. _Investigation; No Additional Representations; No Reliance_.

(a) The Target Companies and the Seller have not made and are not making, and
the Buyer hereby acknowledges, represents and warrants that it has not relied
upon, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, express or implied,
with respect to the matters contained in this Agreement other than the
explicit representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement.

(b) The Buyer has not made and is not making, and the Seller hereby
acknowledges, represents and warrants that it has not relied upon, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, express or implied, with
respect to the matters contained in this Agreement other than the explicit
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement.

(c) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and based thereon has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Target Companies and (ii) will not assert any claim for
indemnification under Section 9.2.2 for a specified breach of a representation
or warranty under this Agreement if, as of  



 

-56-  the date of this Agreement, it has actual knowledge of, including an
understanding of the nature and scope of, such breach of representation or
warranty. 

9.7.4. _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to any Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this Section 9, the Indemnifying Party will
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights that the
Indemnified Party may have against other Persons with respect to the subject
matter of such indemnification claim.

days taken reasonable steps to cure such breach, or (b) if the Closing will
not have occurred on or before August 31, 2008 (the " _Expiration Date_ "), by
reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 6 hereof
(unless the failure results primarily from the Buyer itself breaching any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement), except if,
as of the Expiration Date, all conditions set forth in Section 6 and Section
7 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that are
satisfied by action taken at the Closing) other than the conditions set forth

any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in any
material respect, the Seller has notified the Buyer of the breach, and the

_provided_ , that the failure of the Buyer to fund (or cause to be
funded) the Purchase Price at Closing as required hereunder shall not be
subject to cure hereunder, and in the event of such breach, the Seller may
terminate this Agreement immediately by delivery of notice in writing as
provided in Section 10.1), or (b) if the Closing will not have occurred on or
before the Expiration Date (as the same may be extended), by reason of the

-59- 11.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims arising in whole or in
part out of, related to, based upon, or in connection herewith or the subject
matter hereof will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic substantive Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision (other than Section 5-1401 of the New

whole or in part out of, related to, based upon or in connection with this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof, (b) waives to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is

one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of _forum non
conveniens_ , should be transferred to any court other than one of the above-
named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other
proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named courts, or
that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by
such court, and (c) agrees not to commence any such action other than before
one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other action
seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action to
any court other than one of the above-named courts whether on the grounds of
inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each party hereby ( _x_ ) consents
to service of process in any such action in any manner permitted by New York
Law; ( _y_ ) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (
_x_ ) or made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at
its address specified pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof, will constitute good
and valid service of process in any such action; and ( _z_ ) waives and agrees
not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such
action any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause ( _x_
) or ( _y_ ) does not constitute good and valid service of process.

11.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE
LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT
WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO

CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF

SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY



 

-60- 11.11. _Reliance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been
informed by each other party that the provisions of Sections 11.9 and 11.10
constitute a material inducement upon which such party is relying and will
rely in entering into this Agreement, and each such party agrees that any
breach by such party of any of the provisions of Sections 11.9 or 11.10 above
would constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

11.12.  _Specific Enforcement_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties would be irreparably damaged in the event that this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that each party hereto will be entitled to
seek an injunction to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which such party may be entitled hereunder, at
law or in equity.

11.13. _No Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be
a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or
agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. 

11.14. _Negotiation of Agreement_. Each of the parties acknowledges that it
has been represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it
has executed the same with consent and upon the advice of said independent
counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto will be deemed the work product of the parties
and may not be construed against any party by reason of its
preparation. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against the party
that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

11.15. _Construction_.

11.15.1. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules will not
be deemed an admission or acknowledgment that such information is required to
be listed in the Disclosure Schedules or that such items are material to the
Target Companies. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of
the Disclosure Schedules are inserted for convenience only and will not be
deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of the Agreement. The
Disclosure Schedules are arranged in section corresponding to those contained
in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one
section of the Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a particular
representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such other representations or
warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such item. 

11.15.2. The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant
contained herein will have independent significance. If any party has
breached or violated, or if there is an inaccuracy in, any representation,
