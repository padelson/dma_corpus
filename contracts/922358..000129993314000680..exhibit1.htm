Net Working Capital on the close of business on the Closing Date (&#147;<B><I>Closing Net Working Capital</I></B>&#148;).
</FONT>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Notice of Disagreement</U>. If Sellers disagree with the Closing Net Working Capital
set forth in the Closing Statement, Sellers may, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Sellers&#146; receipt of
the Closing Statement, provide notice to Purchaser in writing setting forth Sellers&#146; disagreement
therewith and Sellers&#146; calculation of Closing Net Working Capital (such notice, a &#147;<B><I>Sellers Notice
of Disagreement</I></B>&#148;). Any Sellers Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail those
items or amounts as to which Sellers disagree, the nature and extent of such disagreement and
Sellers&#146; resulting calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital. Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement. If Purchaser does not
receive a Sellers Notice of Disagreement within such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period, Sellers shall be
deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement with respect to all items set forth therein as of the
expiration of such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period, and the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the
Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Resolution of Disagreement</U>. If Sellers timely deliver a Sellers Notice of
Disagreement, Purchaser and Sellers shall have a period of thirty (30)&nbsp;days from Purchaser&#146;s
receipt thereof to resolve any disagreement specified therein. Any disputed amount resolved in
writing by the Parties during such period or at any time thereafter will become final and binding
on the Parties as of the date of such agreement. Any disputed amounts that cannot be agreed to by
Seller and Purchasers within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Purchaser&#146;s receipt of a Sellers Notice of
Disagreement shall be determined by the Accounting Firm. Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate and
each use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the written determination of any disputed amounts
and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital by the Accounting Firm to be completed within sixty
(60)&nbsp;days after the engagement of the Accounting Firm and such determination shall be final and
binding on the Parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm, acting in the capacity
of an expert and not as an arbitrator shall (i)&nbsp;limit its review to matters specifically set forth
in the Sellers Notice of Disagreement delivered pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(b)</U> as a disputed
item (other than matters thereafter resolved by mutual written agreement of Purchaser and Sellers),
(ii)&nbsp;further limit its review to whether the calculation of any such disputed item is
mathematically accurate and has been prepared using the same accounting principles set forth on
<U>Schedule&nbsp;2.3</U> and (iii)&nbsp;not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such item or less than the smallest value for such item, in each case, claimed by Purchaser in the
Closing Statement or Sellers in the Sellers Notice of Disagreement, as applicable. Purchaser agrees
that it will cause the Acquired Companies to, and Purchaser and Sellers agree that they will use
their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause their respective independent accountants to,
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the conduct of the reviews related to the Accounting
Firm&#146;s determination of disputed amounts under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(c)</U>, including by making
available to the extent necessary books, records, work papers and personnel. The fees and expenses
payable to the Accounting Firm in connection with resolving any dispute under this <U>Section
2.3(c)</U> shall be borne by Purchaser and Sellers in an amount equal to (x)&nbsp;the total amount of
such fees and expenses <I>multiplied by </I>(y)&nbsp;a fraction (A)&nbsp;the numerator of which, (1)&nbsp;in the case of
Purchaser, is the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Statement and the Accounting Firm&#146;s calculation thereof and, (B)&nbsp;in the case of Sellers, is the
difference between the amount of Net Working Capital set forth in the Sellers Notice of
Disagreement and the Accounting Firm&#146;s calculation thereof and, (B)&nbsp;in each case, the denominator
of which is the difference of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Statement
and the amount of Net Working Capital set forth in the Sellers Notice of Disagreement.

Capital pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(b)</U> or <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(c)</U>, as the case may be (such
final and binding amount, the &#147;<B><I>Final Closing Net Working Capital</I></B>&#148;), (i)&nbsp;if the Final Closing Net
Working Capital is a positive number, Purchaser shall pay to Seller such amount in cash (by means
of federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately available funds), or (ii)&nbsp;if the Final
Closing Net Working Capital is a negative number, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser such amount in
cash (by means of federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately available funds). In the
event that any payment is not made by the appropriate Party when due pursuant to the terms of this
<U>Section&nbsp;2.3(d)</U>, such payment shall accrue interest from the date such payment was due at
the Applicable Rate.

<U>Schedule&nbsp;2.4(a)</U> (as finalized, the &#147;<B><I>Final Allocation Statement</I></B>&#148;). Sellers and Purchaser

Allocation Statement in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return (including filing of
IRS Form&nbsp;8594 with a federal income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the date of the

Authority. If the Final Allocation Statement is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the Party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other Party, and the Parties agree (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates) to defend such Final Allocation Statement in any
Proceeding. Not later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the filing of their respective IRS Forms 8594
relating to this transaction, each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a copy of its IRS Form&nbsp;8594.

good faith to determine whether the results of operations of such asset or business (or any change
resulting from such restructuring) shall be included in the computation of EBITDA for any
Calculation Period and, if so, the appropriate change to the EBITDA, if any. Without prior
agreement of the Parties, there shall be no change to the EBITDA Threshold for such Calculation
Period. Notwithstanding any decision made by the Parties with respect to the preceding sentence,
any Seller employed or engaged as a consultant by Purchaser and its Affiliates shall manage,
operate or otherwise provide services to any asset or business acquired that is within the
operational knowledge and experience of any Seller so employed or engaged after the Closing Date,
as requested by Purchaser. The EBITDA for any Calculation Period shall not be increased or
diminished by revenues earned or costs or expenses incurred on direction of Purchaser and its
Affiliates in the acquisition or operation of any asset or business acquired without the agreement
of Sellers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;On or before the date that is sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the last day of each of the two
Calculation Periods (each such date, an &#147;<B><I>Earn-Out Calculation Delivery Date</I></B>&#148;), Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Sellers a written statement (in each case, an &#147;<B><I>Earn-Out Calculation
Statement</I></B>&#148;) setting forth in reasonable detail its determination of EBITDA for the applicable
Calculation Period and its calculation of the resulting Earn-Out Payment (in each case, an

records and work papers used or created in connection with preparation of each Earn-Out Calculation
Statement that are reasonably required to support such Earn-Out Calculation Statement. Such records
and work papers shall be held in confidence by Sellers and their Representatives and not used for
any purpose except in connection with the calculation of EBITDA and the related Earn-Out Payment
and the resolution of any dispute arising with respect thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Sellers shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt of the Earn-Out Calculation Statement
for each Calculation Period (in each case, the &#147;<B><I>Review Period</I></B>&#148;) to review the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement and the Earn-Out Calculation set forth therein. During the Review Period, Sellers and
their Representatives shall have the right to inspect the Purchaser&#146;s Books and Records related to
the Business during normal business hours at Purchaser&#146;s offices, upon reasonable prior notice and
solely for purposes reasonably related to the determinations of EBITDA and the resulting Earn-Out
Payment. Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Seller may object to the Earn-Out
Calculation set forth in the Earn-Out Calculation Statement for the applicable Calculation Period
by delivering a written notice of objection (an &#147;<B><I>Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice</I></B>&#148;) to
Purchaser. Any Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice shall specify the items in the applicable
Earn-Out Calculation disputed by Sellers and shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection, as well as the amount in dispute and Sellers&#146; calculation of each item in dispute. If
Sellers fail to deliver an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice to Purchaser prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then the Earn-Out Calculation set forth in the Earn-Out
Calculation Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. If Sellers timely deliver
an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice, Purchaser and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve the disputed items and agree upon the resulting amount of the EBITDA and the Earn-Out
Payment for the applicable Calculation Period. If Purchaser and Sellers are unable to reach
agreement within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after such an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice has been
given, all unresolved disputed items shall be promptly referred to the Accounting Firm. The
Accounting Firm shall be directed to render a written report on the unresolved disputed items with
respect to the applicable Earn-Out Calculation as promptly as practicable, but in no event greater
than sixty (60)&nbsp;days after such submission to the Accounting Firm, and to resolve only those
unresolved disputed items set forth in the Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice. If unresolved
disputed items are submitted to the Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Sellers shall each furnish to
the Accounting Firm such work papers, schedules and other documents and information relating to the
unresolved disputed items as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request. The Accounting Firm shall
resolve the disputed items based solely on the applicable definitions and other terms in this
Agreement and the presentations by Purchaser and Sellers, and not by independent review. In
resolving the dispute, the Accounting Firm, acting in the capacity of an expert and not as an
arbitrator, shall (i)&nbsp;limit its review to matters specifically set forth in the Earn-Out
Calculation Objection notice (other than matters thereafter resolved by mutual written agreement of
Purchaser and Sellers), and (ii)&nbsp;not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such item or less than the smallest value for such item, in each case, claimed by Purchaser in the
Earn-Out Calculation or Sellers in the Earn-Out Calculation Objection, as applicable. The
resolution of the dispute and the calculation of EBITDA that is the subject of the applicable
Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice by the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Sellers and
Purchaser in proportion to the amounts by which their respective calculations of EBITDA differ from
EBITDA as finally determined by the Accounting Firm.

Days following the date upon which the determination of EBITDA for the applicable Calculation
Period becomes final and binding upon the parties as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.01(c)</U> (including
any final resolution of any dispute raised by Sellers in an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice).
Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the applicable Earn-Out Payment in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account(s) for Sellers designated by the Sellers.

sole discretion with regard to all matters relating to the operation of the Business of the
Acquired Companies, including, but not limited to, restructuring the Acquired Companies; <I>provided</I>,
that Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, take any actions in bad faith that would have the
purpose of avoiding or reducing any of the Earn-Out Payments hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser has no obligation to operate the Business of the Acquired Companies in order
to achieve any Earn-Out Payment or to maximize the amount of any Earn-Out Payment. Sellers
acknowledge that (i)&nbsp;there is no assurance that Sellers will receive any Earn-Out Payment and
Purchaser has not promised or projected any Earn-Out Payment, and (ii)&nbsp;the parties solely intend
the express provisions of this Agreement to govern their contractual relationship.

Payment shall not be represented by any form of certificate or other instrument, are not

community property, and do not constitute an equity or ownership interest in Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies, (ii)&nbsp;Sellers shall not have any rights as a securityholder of Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies as a result of Sellers&#146; contingent right to receive any Earn-Out Payment
hereunder, and (iii)&nbsp;no interest is payable with respect to any Earn-Out Payment.

respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;4.1 <U>Existence and Qualification</U>. Each Acquired Company is a limited liability
company, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization,
and has all requisite power and authority to conduct the Business as it is now being conducted and
to own, lease and operate the Assets owned or used by it. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing (to the extent applicable) under the
Laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the Assets owned
or used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it, makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller
has previously made available to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of the Governing
Documents for each Acquired Company. Such Governing Documents are in full force and effect and no
other Governing Documents are applicable to or binding upon the Acquired Companies. The Acquired
Companies are not currently in violation of any provision of their Governing Documents. No
Proceedings to dissolve an Acquired Company are pending, or to the knowledge of Sellers,
threatened.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;4.2 <U>No Conflicts</U>. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Sellers, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not (a)&nbsp;violate any provision
of the Acquired Companies&#146; Governing Documents, (b)&nbsp;result in a default (with due notice or lapse
of time or both) or the creation of any Lien or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation

any Governmental Body, or notice to, or declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental
Body, under any applicable Law, or violate any Laws applicable to the Acquired Companies or the

free and clear of all Liens, other than those arising by virtue of any actions taken by or on

Organizations Code, and constitute all of the outstanding Equity Securities of each Acquired
Company. Except as set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.3</U>, the Acquired Companies have not granted to
any Person any agreement or option, or any right or privilege capable of becoming an agreement or
option, for the purchase, subscription, allotment or issue of any unissued Equity Securities of the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;To make a claim for indemnification under <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U>, an Indemnified Person shall
notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U>, including the
reasonable details of its claim (the &#147;<B><I>Claim Notice</I></B>&#148;). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a &#147;<B><I>Third
Person Claim</I></B>&#148;), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the

Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U>
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U> except to

against such Third Person Claim under this <U>Article&nbsp;8</U>. If the Indemnifying Person does not
notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30)-day period whether the Indemnifying Person
admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed
to have denied such indemnification obligation hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized,

it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person
and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to
cooperate in contesting any Third Person Claim that the Indemnifying Person elects to contest
(<I>provided, however</I>, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or
cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate in,

Person pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.2(d)</U>. An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto which (i)&nbsp;does not result in a final resolution of the
Indemnified Person&#146;s liability with respect to the Third Person Claim (including, in the case of a
settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person) or (ii)&nbsp;may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its obligation but
fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have
the right to defend against the Third Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with
counsel of the Indemnified Person&#146;s choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to
admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person Claim at any time prior to
settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person
shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10)&nbsp;days following receipt of such notice to
(i)&nbsp;admit in writing its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person
Claim and (ii)&nbsp;if its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person Claim over the objection of the
Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and
assumed the defense of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived
any right to indemnity therefor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i)&nbsp;cure
the Damages complained of, (ii)&nbsp;admit its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to
such Damages or (iii)&nbsp;dispute the claim for such indemnification. If the Indemnifying Person does
not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30)-day period that it has cured the Damages
or that it disputes the claim for such indemnification, the Indemnifying Person shall be
conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder.

Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies or the Assets that are required to be filed
(taking into account any extension) on or before the Closing Date, and Sellers shall pay, or cause
to be paid, all Taxes related to the Acquired Companies or the Assets due on or before the Closing
Date except to the extent any such Taxes are reflected as a current liability in the calculation of
Net Working Capital. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, with respect to
such items, except as required by applicable Law. At least twenty (20)&nbsp;days prior to filing any
such Tax Return, Sellers shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to Purchaser for Purchaser&#146;s review
and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed,
all Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies or the Assets that relate to taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date but that are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and
Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns except to

Capital. Purchaser shall deliver at least twenty (20)&nbsp;days prior to the due date (taking into
account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns to Sellers for Sellers&#146; review a draft of
such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall consider in good faith any comment that Sellers submit to
Purchaser no less than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns. Sellers
shall make the payment due to Purchaser under this Section&nbsp;9.1(b) at least two (2)&nbsp;Business Days

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, any Tax
Return (a &#147;<U>Straddle Period Tax Return</U>&#148;) required to be filed in respect of the Acquired

submit to Purchaser no less than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the due date of such Straddle
Period Tax Return.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;With respect to Taxes in respect of the Acquired Companies or the Assets related to a
Straddle Period, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion
of the Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the close of business on the Closing Date except to
the extent any such Taxes are reflected as a current liability in the calculation of Net Working
Capital. Such Taxes shall be apportioned between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, as of the Closing Date with (a)&nbsp;Sellers being obligated to pay a proportionate share of
the actual amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period determined by <I>multiplying </I>such actual Taxes
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days (including the Closing Date) in the
Straddle Period on or prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in the Straddle Period and (b)&nbsp;Purchaser being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the
actual amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period determined by <I>multiplying </I>such actual Taxes by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period after the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period. Sellers
shall make such payment at least two (2)&nbsp;Business Days before payment of Taxes (including estimated
Taxes) is due to the Taxing Authority.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9.2 <U>Cooperation; Procedures Relating to Tax Claims</U>. Purchaser and Sellers
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns, any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns (other
than a Proceeding relating to a Third Person Claim described in <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U> which shall be
governed by <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U>). Such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon the
other Party&#146;s request) the provision, of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; provided, however, the Party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Party providing such assistance; provided, further, no Party
shall be required to provide assistance at times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably
with the business and operations of such Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9.3 <U>Tax Contests</U>. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such Party of written notice of any inquiries,
claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a &#147;<B><I>Tax Matter</I></B>&#148;). Any failure
to so notify the other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party of any liability
with respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent such party was actually prejudiced as a
result thereof. Purchaser shall have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters, including any
settlement or compromise thereof, provided, however, that Purchaser shall keep Sellers reasonably
informed of the progress of any Tax Matter and shall not effect any such settlement or compromise
with respect to which any Seller is liable without obtaining such Seller&#146;s prior written consent
thereto, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event of a conflict between a
provision in this <U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U> and a provision in <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U>, the provision in this
<U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U> shall control.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9.4 <U>Indemnification</U>. Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each member of the Purchaser Group from and against all Damages incurred,
suffered by or asserted against such Persons caused by or arising out of or resulting from: (i)&nbsp;all
Taxes related to the Acquired Companies or the Assets with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period;
(ii)&nbsp;with respect to all Straddle Periods, all Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies or the
Assets that are allocable, pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.1(d), to the portion of a Straddle Period ending
on (and including) the Closing Date; (iii)&nbsp;all Taxes of Sellers (including, without limitation,
capital gains Taxes arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or any
of their Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies) for any Tax period; (iv)&nbsp;Taxes for which any
of the Acquired Companies (or any predecessor of the foregoing) is held liable under Section
1.1502-6 of the United States Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law) by reason of such entity being included in any consolidated, affiliated, combined or
unitary group at any time on or before the Closing Date; (v)&nbsp;Taxes imposed on or payable by third
parties with respect to which an Acquired Company has an obligation to indemnify such third party
pursuant to a transaction consummated on or prior to the Closing; and (vi)&nbsp;any Taxes arising out of
or resulting from the payment of the Payoff Debt; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that Sellers shall have no
liability under this <U>Section&nbsp;9.4</U> for any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were specifically
reflected in the Closing Net Working Capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9.5 <U>Purchase Price Adjustments</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to
the extent that Purchaser receives any cash Tax refund to which any Seller is entitled as described
above, Purchaser shall immediately pay such amount to such Seller to the extent the Purchase Price
has not been increased pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U> on account thereof, net of any (i)&nbsp;Taxes
payable by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates which result from the receipt of such Tax refund and
(ii)&nbsp;reasonable expenses incurred by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in obtaining such Tax
refund.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9.6 <U>Characterization of Certain Payments</U>. The Parties agree that any payments
made pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.5</U>, <U>Article&nbsp;8</U> or this <U>Article&nbsp;9</U> shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9.7 <U>Characterization of Transaction</U>. The Parties recognize that Purchaser&#146;s
purchase of the Membership Interests will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as (i)&nbsp;a
sale by Sellers of the Membership Interests and (ii)&nbsp;a purchase by Purchaser of the Assets,
pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432. None of Sellers or Purchaser shall take any
position for income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with such treatment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9.8 <U>Disputes</U>. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the provisions of this
Agreement that relate to Taxes that cannot be resolved by good faith negotiations between Purchaser
and Sellers shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm to be resolved in accordance with Section
2.3(d), <I>mutatis mutandis</I>.

use, excise, real property transfer or gain, gross receipts, goods and services, registration,
capital, documentary, stamp or transfer Taxes, recording fees and similar Taxes and fees incurred
and imposed upon, or with respect to, the transactions contemplated hereby. If such transactions

PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.5 <U>Specific Performance</U>. Each Party recognizes that in the event of any
breach of this Agreement (whether or not such breach is material or willful), monetary damages
alone would not be adequate to compensate other Parties for their injuries. Each non-breaching
Party shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, to
obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought to enforce
this Agreement, the breaching Party shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at
law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.6 <U>Waivers</U>. A failure by any Party to comply with any of its obligations,
agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, by
an instrument signed by such party and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other
manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether
or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

shall any Party assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder, without the prior written
consent of the other Parties (which consent may be withheld for any reason) and any assignment or
delegation made without such consent shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

the Appendix, Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto) and the documents to be executed hereunder
constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.9 <U>Amendment</U>. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing executed by all Parties and expressly identified as an amendment or
modification.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.10 <U>No Third Party Beneficiaries</U>. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle
any Person other than Purchaser and Sellers to any claims, cause of action, remedy or right of any
kind, except the rights expressly provided in <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U> to the Persons described therein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.11 <U>Construction</U>. The Parties acknowledge that (a)&nbsp;Sellers and Purchaser
have had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of the
details of the transaction contemplated hereby, (b)&nbsp;this Agreement is the result of arms-length
negotiations from equal bargaining positions and (c)&nbsp;Sellers and Purchaser and their respective

or construction of this Agreement.

(INCLUDING BASED ON LOST PROFITS OR ANY SIMILAR MEASURE), PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN

PROVIDED IN THIS SENTENCE, EACH OF SELLERS AND PURCHASER, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.14 <U>Time of Essence</U>. This Agreement contains a number of dates and times by
which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties intend that each and every such
date and time be the firm and final date and time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby
waives and relinquishes any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet any
performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis that its late action constitutes
substantial performance, to require any other Party to show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds.
Without limiting the foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified
in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the
period during which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date that
is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the
expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall
be the next day that is a Business Day.

representation or warranty that addresses matters that are material or matters having a Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter is material or does, or may, have
a Material Adverse Effect. Likewise, the inclusion of a matter on a Schedule to this Agreement in
relation to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an indication that such matter
necessarily would, or may, breach such representation or warranty absent its inclusion on such
Schedule. Matters may be disclosed on a Schedule for information purposes only.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.16 <U>Severability</U>. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other terms or provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction and the remaining
terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect, unless doing so would result in an
interpretation of this Agreement that is manifestly unjust.
