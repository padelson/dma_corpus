MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT    

This Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as
of May 1, 2014 (the " _Closing Date_ "), by and among William C. Cocke, Jr.,
Matthew Z. Mosser, D. Westley Thomas III, Damon W. Perrin and Joseph V.
DeBellas (each a " _Seller_ " and collectively, " _Sellers_ "), J.
Cody Bates, as a Sable II Member (as defined herein), and Ferrellgas, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, (" _Purchaser_ "). Each of the Sellers and
Purchaser are sometimes referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_."   

RECITALS:    

A. Sellers collectively own 100% of the issued and outstanding membership
interests in each of Sable Environmental, LLC, a Texas limited liability
company (" _Sable Environmental_ "), and Sable Environmental SWD 2, LLC, a
Texas limited liability company (" _Sable SWD 2_ ").   

B. Sable Environmental owns 100% of the issued and outstanding membership
interests in each of Sable Environmental SWD 4, LLC, a Texas limited
liability company (" _Sable SWD 4_ "), Sable Environmental SWD 5, LLC, a
Texas limited liability company (" _Sable SWD 5_ "), and Sable Environmental
SWD 7, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (" _Sable SWD 7_ " and together
with Sable Environmental, Sable SWD 2, Sable SWD 4 and Sable SWD 5, the "
_Acquired Companies_ ").   

C. Sellers desire to sell, and Purchaser desires to acquire, all of the issued
and outstanding membership interests in each of Sable Environmental and Sable
SWD 2 (collectively, the " _Purchased Membership Interests_ ") upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein.   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises,
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound by the terms
hereof, agree as follows:   

ARTICLE 1 
 DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION    

Section 1.1 _Defined Terms_. In addition to the terms defined in the
introductory paragraph and the Recitals of this Agreement, for purposes
hereof, the capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings set forth in _Appendix A_.   

Section 1.2 _References and Rules of Construction_. All references in this
Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Appendices, Articles, Sections,
subsections, clauses and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections, clauses and
other subdivisions of or to this Agreement unless expressly provided
otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Exhibits, Schedules,
Appendices, Articles, Sections, subsections, clauses and other subdivisions
of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of
this Agreement and shall be disregarded in construing the language hereof. The
words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and
words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section, subsection, clause or other subdivision unless
expressly so limited. The words "this Article," "this Section,"
"this subsection," "this clause," and words of similar import, refer only to
the Article, Section, subsection and clause hereof in which such words occur.
The word "including" (in its various forms) means "including without
limitation." All references to "$" or "dollars" shall be deemed references to
United States dollars. Each accounting term not defined herein will have the
meaning given to it under GAAP as interpreted as of the date of this
Agreement. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, the word "or" is not
exclusive. Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be
construed to state and include any other gender, and words, terms and titles
(including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires.
Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are attached to and by
this reference incorporated herein for all purposes. Reference herein to
any federal, state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed to also refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The words "day" or "days" shall mean calendar days, unless denoted
as a Business Day.   

ARTICLE 2 
 PURCHASE AND SALE; PURCHASE PRICE    

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Concurrently with the execution and pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Sellers hereby sell, transfer, assign, convey
and deliver to Purchaser the Purchased Membership Interests, and Purchaser
hereby purchases, acquires and accepts the Purchased Membership Interests, in
each case, free and clear of all Liens.   

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by
Purchaser for the Purchased Membership Interests (the " _Purchase Price_ ")
shall be an amount equal to (i) $124,700,000 (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "),
subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.3_. Concurrently with the
execution hereof, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers
an amount equal to (a) the Base Purchase Price, _minus_ (b) the Payoff Debt,
and _minus_ (c) the Dilley Purchase Amount (the " _Estimated Cash Purchase
Price_ "). The Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall be paid by Purchaser to
Sellers as provided in _Section 7.3(a)_.   

Section 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.   

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Purchasers good faith calculation of the Net Working Capital on the close of
business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Net Working Capital_ ").   

(b) _Notice of Disagreement_. If Sellers disagree with the Closing Net
Working Capital set forth in the Closing Statement, Sellers may, within
thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement, provide
notice to Purchaser in writing setting forth Sellers disagreement therewith
and Sellers calculation of Closing Net Working Capital (such notice, a "
_Sellers Notice of Disagreement_ "). Any Sellers Notice of Disagreement shall
specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which Sellers
disagree, the nature and extent of such disagreement and Sellers resulting
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital. Sellers shall be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing
Statement. If Purchaser does not receive a Sellers Notice of Disagreement
within such thirty (30) day period, Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted
the Closing Statement with respect to all items set forth therein as of
the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, and the Closing Net Working
Capital set forth in the Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the
Parties.   

(c) _Resolution of Disagreement_. If Sellers timely deliver a Sellers Notice
of Disagreement, Purchaser and Sellers shall have a period of thirty (30)
days from Purchasers receipt thereof to resolve any disagreement specified
therein. Any disputed amount resolved in writing by the Parties during such
period or at any time thereafter will become final and binding on the Parties
as of the date of such agreement. Any disputed amounts that cannot be agreed
to by Seller and Purchasers within thirty (30) days after Purchasers receipt
of a Sellers Notice of Disagreement shall be determined by the Accounting
Firm. Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate and each use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cause the written determination of any disputed
amounts and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital by the Accounting Firm
to be completed within sixty (60) days after the engagement of the Accounting
Firm and such determination shall be final and binding on the Parties. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm, acting in the capacity of
an expert and not as an arbitrator shall (i) limit its review to matters
specifically set forth in the Sellers Notice of Disagreement delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ as a disputed item (other than matters
thereafter resolved by mutual written agreement of Purchaser and
Sellers), (ii) further limit its review to whether the calculation of any
such disputed item is mathematically accurate and has been prepared using the
same accounting principles set forth on  _Schedule 2.3_ and (iii) not assign
a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item or less
than the smallest value for such item, in each case, claimed by Purchaser in
the Closing Statement or Sellers in the Sellers Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable. Purchaser agrees that it will cause the Acquired Companies to,
and Purchaser and Sellers agree that they will use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cause their respective independent accountants
to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the conduct of the reviews
related to the Accounting Firms determination of disputed amounts under this
_Section 2.3(c)_, including by making available to the extent necessary
books, records, work papers and personnel. The fees and expenses payable to
the Accounting Firm in connection with resolving any dispute under this
_Section 2.3(c)_ shall be borne by Purchaser and Sellers in an amount equal
to (x) the total amount of such fees and expenses _multiplied by_ (y) a
fraction (A) the numerator of which, (1) in the case of Purchaser, is the
difference between the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the
Closing Statement and the Accounting Firms calculation thereof and, (B) in
the case of Sellers, is the difference between the amount of Net Working
Capital set forth in the Sellers Notice of Disagreement and the Accounting
Firms calculation thereof and, (B) in each case, the denominator of which is
the difference of the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Statement and the amount of Net Working Capital set forth in the Sellers
Notice of Disagreement.   

(d) Within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Closing
Net Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ or _Section 2.3(c)_, as
the case may be (such final and binding amount, the " _Final Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), (i) if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is a
positive number, Purchaser shall pay to Seller such amount in cash (by
means of federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately available
funds), or (ii) if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is a negative
number, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser such amount in cash (by means of
federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately available funds). In
the event that any payment is not made by the appropriate Party when due
pursuant to the terms of this  _Section 2.3(d)_, such payment shall accrue
interest from the date such payment was due at the Applicable Rate.   

Section 2.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.   

(a) _Schedule 2.4(a)_ sets forth the allocation of the Purchase Price among
the aggregate Membership Interests of each of the Acquired Companies.   

(b) Not later than ninety (90) days after the determination of the Purchase
Price pursuant to  _Section 2.3_, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a
statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") allocating the Purchase Price
(plus the liabilities of each Acquired Company to the extent properly taken
into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and consistent with the allocation set forth on
Schedule 2.5(a). Sellers will have twenty (20) days to review and comment on
the Allocation Statement, and Purchaser will make such revisions as are
timely and reasonably requested by Sellers in writing to the extent such
revisions are consistent with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and
the allocation set forth on  _Schedule 2.4(a)_ (as finalized, the " _Final
Allocation Statement_ "). Sellers and Purchaser agree to (i) be bound by the
Final Allocation Statement, (ii) act in accordance with the Final Allocation
Statement in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return (including
filing of IRS Form 8594 with a federal income Tax Return for the taxable year
that includes the date of the Closing) except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, (iii) cooperate in the filing of any forms (including IRS
Form 8594) required to be filed with regard to the Final Allocation
Statement, including any amendments to such forms required pursuant to any
applicable Law or this Agreement and (iv) take no position, and cause their
Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the Final Allocation
Statement on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any
Taxing Authority. If the Final Allocation Statement is disputed by any Taxing
Authority, the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify
the other Party, and the Parties agree (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates) to defend such Final Allocation Statement in any Proceeding. Not
later than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of their respective IRS Forms
8594 relating to this transaction, each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
copy of its IRS Form 8594.   

Section 2.5 _Earn-Out_.   

(a) As additional consideration for the Purchased Membership Interests, at
such times as provided in _Section 2.5(e)_, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers
with respect to each of the two Calculation Periods within the Earn-Out
Period an amount (each, an " _Earn-Out Payment_ "), if any, equal to the
product of (i) an amount equal to (A) the EBITDA for such Calculation Period,
_minus_  (B) the EBITDA Threshold for such Calculation Period; multiplied by
(ii) the Earn-Out Multiple. If the EBITDA for a particular Calculation Period
does not exceed the applicable EBITDA Threshold, no Earn-out Payment shall be
due for such Calculation Period.   

(b) Upon any acquisition of an asset or business by the Acquired Companies or
a restructuring of the Acquired Companies as permitted by _Section 2.5(f)_,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine whether the results of
operations of such asset or business (or any change resulting from such
restructuring) shall be included in the computation of EBITDA for
any Calculation Period and, if so, the appropriate change to the EBITDA, if
any. Without prior agreement of the Parties, there shall be no change to the
EBITDA Threshold for such Calculation Period. Notwithstanding any decision
made by the Parties with respect to the preceding sentence, any Seller
employed or engaged as a consultant by Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
manage, operate or otherwise provide services to any asset or business
acquired that is within the operational knowledge and experience of any
Seller so employed or engaged after the Closing Date, as requested by
Purchaser. The EBITDA for any Calculation Period shall not be increased
or diminished by revenues earned or costs or expenses incurred on direction
of Purchaser and its Affiliates in the acquisition or operation of any asset
or business acquired without the agreement of Sellers.   

(c) On or before the date that is sixty (60) days after the last day of each
of the two Calculation Periods (each such date, an " _Earn-Out Calculation
Delivery Date_ "), Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a written
statement (in each case, an " _Earn-Out Calculation Statement_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail its determination of EBITDA for the
applicable Calculation Period and its calculation of the resulting Earn-Out
Payment (in each case, an " _Earn-Out Calculation_ "). Purchaser shall
provide Sellers and their Representatives copies of such records and work
papers used or created in connection with preparation of each Earn-Out
Calculation Statement that are reasonably required to support such Earn-Out
Calculation Statement. Such records and work papers shall be held in
confidence by Sellers and their Representatives and not used for any purpose
except in connection with the calculation of EBITDA and the related Earn-Out
Payment and the resolution of any dispute arising with respect thereto.   

(d) Sellers shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Earn-Out
Calculation Statement for each Calculation Period (in each case, the "
_Review Period_ ") to review the Earn-Out Calculation Statement and the Earn-
Out Calculation set forth therein. During the Review Period, Sellers
and their Representatives shall have the right to inspect the Purchasers
Books and Records related to the Business during normal business hours at
Purchasers offices, upon reasonable prior notice and solely for purposes
reasonably related to the determinations of EBITDA and the resulting Earn-
Out Payment. Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Seller may object
to the Earn-Out Calculation set forth in the Earn-Out Calculation Statement
for the applicable Calculation Period by delivering a written notice of
objection (an " _Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice_ ") to Purchaser. Any
Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice shall specify the items in the
applicable Earn-Out Calculation disputed by Sellers and shall describe in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection, as well as the amount in
dispute and Sellers calculation of each item in dispute. If Sellers fail to
deliver an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice to Purchaser prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, then the Earn-Out Calculation set forth
in the Earn-Out Calculation Statement shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto. If Sellers timely deliver an Earn-Out Calculation Objection
Notice, Purchaser and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
disputed items and agree upon the resulting amount of the EBITDA and the Earn-
Out Payment for the applicable Calculation Period. If Purchaser and Sellers
are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after such an Earn-Out
Calculation Objection Notice has been given, all unresolved disputed items
shall be promptly referred to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall
be directed to render a written report on the unresolved disputed items
with respect to the applicable Earn-Out Calculation as promptly as
practicable, but in no event greater than sixty (60) days after such
submission to the Accounting Firm, and to resolve only those unresolved
disputed items set forth in the Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice. If
unresolved disputed items are submitted to the Accounting Firm, Purchaser and
Sellers shall each furnish to the Accounting Firm such work papers, schedules
and other documents and information relating to the unresolved disputed items
as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request. The Accounting Firm
shall resolve the disputed items based solely on the applicable definitions
and other terms in this Agreement and the presentations by Purchaser and
Sellers, and not by independent review. In resolving the dispute, the
Accounting Firm, acting in the capacity of an expert and not as
an arbitrator, shall (i) limit its review to matters specifically set forth
in the Earn-Out Calculation Objection notice (other than matters thereafter
resolved by mutual written agreement of Purchaser and Sellers), and (ii) not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item or
less than the smallest value for such item, in each case, claimed by Purchaser
in the Earn-Out Calculation or Sellers in the Earn-Out Calculation Objection,
as applicable. The resolution of the dispute and the calculation of EBITDA
that is the subject of the applicable Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice
by the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Sellers
and Purchaser in proportion to the amounts by which their respective
calculations of EBITDA differ from EBITDA as finally determined by the
Accounting Firm.   

(e) Subject to _Section 2.5(g)_, any Earn-Out Payment that Purchaser is
required to pay pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ hereof shall be paid in full no
later than thirty (30) Business Days following the date upon which the
determination of EBITDA for the applicable Calculation Period becomes final
and binding upon the parties as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_ (including any
final resolution of any dispute raised by Sellers in an Earn-Out Calculation
Objection Notice). Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the applicable Earn-Out
Payment in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank
account(s) for Sellers designated by the Sellers.   

(f) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, subsequent to the Closing,
Purchaser shall have sole discretion with regard to all matters relating to
the operation of the Business of the Acquired Companies, including, but not
limited to, restructuring the Acquired Companies; _provided_ , that Purchaser
shall not, directly or indirectly, take any actions in bad faith that would
have the purpose of avoiding or reducing any of the Earn-Out Payments
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser has no obligation to
operate the Business of the Acquired Companies in order to achieve any Earn-
Out Payment or to maximize the amount of any Earn-Out Payment.
Sellers acknowledge that (i) there is no assurance that Sellers will receive

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES    

Each Seller hereby jointly and severally represents and warrants to Purchaser
as of the date hereof that:   

Section 4.1 _Existence and Qualification_. Each Acquired Company is a limited
liability company, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, and has all requisite power and authority
to conduct the Business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and
operate the Assets owned or used by it. Each Acquired Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing (to the
extent applicable) under the Laws of each state or other jurisdiction in
which either the ownership or use of the Assets owned or used by it, or the
nature of the activities conducted by it, makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller has previously made available to
Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of the Governing Documents for
each Acquired Company. Such Governing Documents are in full force and effect
and no other Governing Documents are applicable to or binding upon the
Acquired Companies. The Acquired Companies are not currently in violation of
any provision of their Governing Documents. No Proceedings to dissolve an
Acquired Company are pending, or to the knowledge of
Sellers, threatened.   

Section 4.2 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Sellers, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will not (a) violate any provision of the Acquired Companies Governing
Documents, (b) result in a default (with due notice or lapse of time or both)
or the creation of any Lien or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration under any of the terms, conditions, or
provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license or
agreement to which the Acquired Companies are a party or to which the Assets
or the Membership Interests are subject, (c) violate any judgment, order,
ruling or decree by which an Acquired Company is bound, (d) assuming all of
the consents set forth on  _Schedule 4.2_ have been obtained (the " _Company

declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Body, under any
applicable Law, or violate any Laws applicable to the Acquired Companies or
the Assets, except any matters described in _clauses (b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_
or  _(e)_ above that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.   

Section 4.3 _Capitalization_. _Schedule 4.3_ sets forth an accurate and
complete list of the Membership Interests owned by each Seller and Sable
Environmental. Sellers and Sable Environmental, as applicable, are the direct
owners, holders of record, and beneficial owners of the Membership Interests
as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ free and clear of all Liens, other than those
arising by virtue of any actions taken by or on behalf of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or pursuant to or described in this Agreement, the Governing
Documents of each Acquired Company, applicable securities Laws or _Schedule
4.3_, and none of the Membership Interests are subject to any voting trust,
member or partnership agreement or voting agreement or other agreement,
right, instrument or understanding with respect to any purchase, sale,
issuance, transfer, repurchase, redemption or voting of any Equity Securities
of each Acquired Company, other than the Governing Documents of such Acquired
Company or as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_. When transferred to Purchaser at
the Closing, the Membership Interests will be owned by Purchaser free and
clear of all Liens, other than those arising by virtue of any actions taken by

may be imposed by federal or state securities Laws. The Membership Interests
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, except as
provided in Sections 101.114 and 101.206 of the Texas Business Organizations
Code, and constitute all of the outstanding Equity Securities of each
Acquired Company. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_, the Acquired
Companies have not granted to any Person any agreement or option, or any
right or privilege capable of becoming an agreement or option, for the
purchase, subscription, allotment or issue of any unissued Equity Securities

of an Acquired Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity
Interest in such Acquired Company.

Acquired Company owns any Equity Interests in any other Person.

Acquired Company has performed all material obligations required to have been
performed and is not in material breach or material default under the
respective Company Contracts, except for such breaches or defaults that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a

correct and complete copies of each Company Contract and all
written amendments, waivers and modifications thereto.

behalf of Sellers or the Acquired Companies within the last three (3) years

Delaware. Purchaser is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and
is in good standing (to the extent applicable) under the Laws of each state
or other jurisdiction where the actions to be performed by it hereunder

Section 5.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and all documents required to be executed and

binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with their terms

Section 5.3 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Purchaser, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will not (a) violate any provision of the Governing Documents of Purchaser,
(b) result in a default (with due notice or lapse of time or both) or the

obtained or obtainable by the individuals listed in _Schedule 5.5_ after

of the Acquired Companies.

attempt to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of the Acquired
Companies or potential clients or customers of the Acquired Companies for
purposes of diverting their business or services from the Acquired
Companies.   

(e) Sellers acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach of this _Section
6.9_ would give rise to irreparable harm to Purchaser, for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by Sellers of any such obligations,
Purchaser shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may
be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific
performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of
competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).   

(f) Sellers acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.9_

the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 6.9_ should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court
is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be
deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic,
product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The
covenants contained in this _Section 6._9 and each provision hereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not

not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any
other jurisdiction.

definitive agreements for such sale. Any sale by Sable II Members of the
Sable II Business to Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be at the Option

_Section 8.1_ contains the Parties exclusive remedies against each other
with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties in this Agreement (other than as provided in

RELEASES, REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES THE OTHER AND ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL
SUCH PARTIES AND ITS AFFILIATES OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
ADVISORS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS,

HAVE, BASED ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF (i) THIS AGREEMENT, (ii)
SELLERS OWNERSHIP, USE OR OPERATION OF THE ASSETS OR (iii) THE CONDITION,

AFFILIATE OF AN ACQUIRED COMPANY, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY RELEASED PERSON.   

(e) The indemnity of Sellers and Purchaser provided in this _Section 8.1_
shall be for the benefit of and extend to each Person included in the Seller
Group and the Purchaser Group, as applicable; _provided_ , _however,_ that
any claim for indemnity under this _Section 8.1_ by any such Person must be
brought and administered by a Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified
Person (including any Person within the Seller Group and the Purchaser Group)
other than Sellers and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Sellers
or Purchaser under the terms of this  _Section 8.1_ except as may be
exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or such Seller, as applicable, pursuant
to this _Section 8.1(e)_. Sellers and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not
exercise indemnification rights under this _Section 8.1_ on behalf of the
other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall
have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or
inaction under this _Section 8.1_.   

Section 8.2 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under 
_Section 8.1_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:   

(a) For purposes hereof, (i) the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such
Damages pursuant to this _Article 8_ and (ii) the term " _Indemnified
Person_ " when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the
Person or Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such
Damages by another Person or Persons pursuant to this _Article 8_.   

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under _Section 8.1_, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this _Section
8.2_, including the reasonable details of its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ ").
In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a
third Person against the Indemnified Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after
the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Third Person Claim and
shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third
Person Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give
notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in this _Section 8.2_ shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under _Section 8.1_ except
to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Persons
ability to defend against the Third Person Claim. In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice
shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.   

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt
of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or
denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third
Person Claim under this _Article 8_. If the Indemnifying Person does
not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30)-day period whether
the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the
Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed to have denied such
indemnification obligation hereunder. The Indemnified Person is
authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30)-day period, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.   

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Person Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested
by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Third Person Claim that the Indemnifying Person elects to
contest ( _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be
required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person).
The Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Person Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Person pursuant to this _Section 8.2(d)_. An Indemnifying
Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person,
settle any Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution of
the Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Third Person Claim
(including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of
the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by
the indemnity).   

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third
Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person
Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide
indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified
Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10)
days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation
to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim and (ii) if
its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the
proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person Claim
over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person
has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense of a
Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any
right to indemnity therefor.   

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt
of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii)
dispute the claim for such indemnification. If the Indemnifying Person
does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30)-day period
that it has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such
indemnification, the Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed
obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder.   

Section 8.3 _Limitation on Actions_.   

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date,

the representations and warranties in _Section 4.8_ and the covenants
contained in _Article 9_ shall terminate on the date that is ninety (90) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and (iii)
the representation and warranties in _Section 5.7_ through _Section 5.10_
(inclusive) and _Section 5.13_ shall survive indefinitely. The covenants and
agreements of the Parties in _Article 6_ shall survive until fully performed
in accordance with their terms.   

(b) The indemnities in _Section 8.1(a)_ and _Section 8.1(b)_ shall terminate
as of the expiration date, if any, of each respective representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification
thereunder, except in each case as to matters for which a specific written
claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or
before such termination date.   

(c) Except for indemnification related to the Core Representations,
indemnification related to  _Section 8.1(c)_, the representations and
warranties in _Section 4.8_ and the covenants contained in _Article 9_, as
to which the limitations in this paragraph shall not apply, Sellers shall not
have any liability for any indemnification under _Section 8.1_ (i)
for individual claims that do not exceed $25,000 in Damages and (ii) until
and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages for which
Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds $250,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), and then only to the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible.   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, (i) except for indemnification related to the Core
Representations, indemnification related to _Section 8.1(c)_ , the
representations and warranties in _Section 4.8_ and the covenants
contained in _Article 9_, as to which the limitations in this paragraph
shall not apply, Sellers shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser
Group under this _Article 8_ for aggregate Damages in excess of $31,250,000
and (ii) the aggregate amount of Sellers indemnification obligations under
this _Article 8_ shall not exceed the actual proceeds from the Purchase Price
received by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement.   

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this _Article 8_ shall be reduced by (i) the amount of
insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with
respect to such Damages and (ii) an amount equal to the amount of any Tax
benefit reasonably expected to be received by the Indemnified Person or
its Affiliates in connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances
giving rise thereto.   

(f) In no event shall any Person be entitled to indemnification hereunder with
respect to a breach by an Indemnifying Person of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants made or agreed to by such Indemnifying Person
hereunder of which such Person had actual knowledge prior to the Closing
Date.   

ARTICLE 9 
 TAX MATTERS    

Section 9.1 _Tax Filings_.   

(a) Sellers shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and

Assets that are required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on
or before the Closing Date, and Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, all
Taxes related to the Acquired Companies or the Assets due on or before the
Closing Date except to the extent any such Taxes are reflected as a current
liability in the calculation of Net Working Capital. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, with respect
to such items, except as required by applicable Law. At least twenty (20)
days prior to filing any such Tax Return, Sellers shall submit a copy of such
Tax Return to Purchaser for Purchasers review and approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld.   

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies or the
Assets that relate to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
but that are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and Sellers shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns
except to the extent any such Taxes are reflected as a current liability in
the calculation of Net Working Capital. Purchaser shall deliver at least
twenty (20) days prior to the due date (taking into account any extension)
for the filing of such Tax Returns to Sellers for Sellers review a draft
of such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall consider in good faith any comment that
Sellers submit to Purchaser no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
due date of such Tax Returns. Sellers shall make the payment due to Purchaser
under this Section 9.1(b) at least two (2) Business Days before payment of
Taxes (including estimated Taxes) is due to the Taxing Authority.   

(c) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, any Tax Return (a " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ ") required to
be filed in respect of the Acquired Companies or the Assets for a Straddle
Period. Purchaser shall deliver at least twenty (20) days prior to the due
date for the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return to Sellers for
Sellers review a draft of such Tax Return. Purchaser shall reflect any
reasonable comment that Sellers submit to Purchaser no less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date of such Straddle Period Tax Return.   

(d) With respect to Taxes in respect of the Acquired Companies or the Assets
related to a Straddle Period, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount of
such Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that is deemed to
end on the close of business on the Closing Date except to the extent any
such Taxes are reflected as a current liability in the calculation of Net
Working Capital. Such Taxes shall be apportioned between Sellers, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date with (a)
Sellers being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the actual amount of
such Taxes for the Straddle Period determined by _multiplying_ such actual
Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days (including
the Closing Date) in the Straddle Period on or prior to the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period
and (b) Purchaser being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the actual
amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period determined by _multiplying_ such
actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the Straddle Period after the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in the Straddle Period. Sellers shall make such
payment at least two (2) Business Days before payment of Taxes (including
estimated Taxes) is due to the Taxing Authority.   

Section 9.2 _Cooperation; Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_. Purchaser and
Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any audit, litigation or other
Proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns (other than a Proceeding
relating to a Third Person Claim described in _Section 8.2_ which shall
be governed by _Section 8.2_). Such cooperation shall include the retention,
and (upon the other Partys request) the provision, of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder; provided, however, the Party requesting assistance shall
pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Party providing
such assistance; provided, further, no Party shall be required to provide
assistance at times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the
business and operations of such Party.   

Section 9.3 _Tax Contests_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such Party of
written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar
events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ "). Any
failure to so notify the other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve such
other party of any liability with respect to such Tax Matters except to the
extent such party was actually prejudiced as a result thereof. Purchaser
shall have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters, including
any settlement or compromise thereof, provided, however, that Purchaser shall
keep Sellers reasonably informed of the progress of any Tax Matter and shall
not effect any such settlement or compromise with respect to which any Seller
is liable without obtaining such Sellers prior written consent thereto,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event of a
conflict between a provision in this _Section 9.3_ and a provision in
_Section 8.2_, the provision in this  _Section 9.3_ shall control.   

Section 9.4 _Indemnification_. Sellers shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Purchaser Group from
and against all Damages incurred, suffered by or asserted against such
Persons caused by or arising out of or resulting from: (i) all Taxes related
to the Acquired Companies or the Assets with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (ii) with respect to all Straddle Periods, all Taxes imposed on the
Acquired Companies or the Assets that are allocable, pursuant to Section
9.1(d), to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date; (iii) all Taxes of Sellers (including, without
limitation, capital gains Taxes arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) or any of their Affiliates (excluding the
Acquired Companies) for any Tax period; (iv) Taxes for which any of the
Acquired Companies (or any predecessor of the foregoing) is held liable under
Section 1.1502-6 of the United States Treasury Regulations (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law) by reason of such entity being
included in any consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group at any
time on or before the Closing Date; (v) Taxes imposed on or payable by
third parties with respect to which an Acquired Company has an obligation to
indemnify such third party pursuant to a transaction consummated on or prior
to the Closing; and (vi) any Taxes arising out of or resulting from the
payment of the Payoff Debt; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall have
no liability under this _Section 9.4_ for any Taxes to the extent such Taxes
were specifically reflected in the Closing Net Working Capital.   

Section 9.5 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, to the extent that Purchaser receives any cash Tax refund to which
any Seller is entitled as described above, Purchaser shall immediately pay
such amount to such Seller to the extent the Purchase Price has not been
increased pursuant to _Section 2.3_ on account thereof, net of any (i)
Taxes payable by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates which result from the
receipt of such Tax refund and (ii) reasonable expenses incurred by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates in obtaining such Tax refund.   

Section 9.6 _Characterization of Certain Payments_. The Parties agree that any
payments made pursuant to _Section 2.5_, _Article 8_ or this _Article 9_
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.   

Section 9.7 _Characterization of Transaction_. The Parties recognize that
Purchasers purchase of the Membership Interests will be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as (i) a sale by Sellers of the Membership
Interests and (ii) a purchase by Purchaser of the Assets, pursuant to Revenue
Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432. None of Sellers or Purchaser shall take
any position for income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with such
treatment.   

Section 9.8 _Disputes_. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the
provisions of this Agreement that relate to Taxes that cannot be resolved by
good faith negotiations between Purchaser and Sellers shall be submitted to
the Accounting Firm to be resolved in accordance with Section 2.3(d),
_mutatis mutandis_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.   

(b) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE
FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS AND
APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM MAY
BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY
MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE,
CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT.   

Section 10.5 _Specific Performance_. Each Party recognizes that in the event
of any breach of this Agreement (whether or not such breach is material or
willful), monetary damages alone would not be adequate to compensate other
Parties for their injuries. Each non-breaching Party shall therefore be
entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, to obtain
specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought
to enforce this Agreement, the breaching Party shall waive the defense that
there is an adequate remedy at law.   

Section 10.6 _Waivers_. A failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by
Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, by an instrument signed by such party
and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No waiver
of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall
be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other
provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute
a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.   

Section 10.7 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign all or any part of this
Agreement, nor shall any Party assign or delegate any of its rights or duties
hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Parties (which
consent may be withheld for any reason) and any assignment or delegation made
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.   

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including, for purposes of
certainty, the Appendix, Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto) and the
documents to be executed hereunder constitute the entire agreement between
the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral
or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.   

Section 10.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by
an agreement in writing executed by all Parties and expressly identified as
an amendment or modification.   

Section 10.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
entitle any Person other than Purchaser and Sellers to any claims, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided in
_Section 8.1_ to the Persons described therein.   

Section 10.11 _Construction_. The Parties acknowledge that (a) Sellers and
Purchaser have had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated
hereby, (b) this Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from
equal bargaining positions and (c) Sellers and Purchaser and their
respective counsel participated in the preparation and negotiation of this
Agreement. Any rule of construction that a contract be construed against the
drafter shall not apply to the interpretation or construction of this
Agreement.

CONTRARY, NONE OF PURCHASER, SELLERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES
SHALL BE ENTITLED TO SPECIAL, INDIRECT (INCLUDING BASED ON LOST PROFITS OR
ANY SIMILAR MEASURE), PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND, EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SENTENCE, EACH OF SELLERS AND PURCHASER, FOR
ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
ANY SUCH SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.   

Section 10.13 _Conspicuous_. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED
BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT IN BOLD-
TYPE FONT ARE "CONSPICUOUS" FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW.   

Section 10.14 _Time of Essence_. This Agreement contains a number of dates and
times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties
intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final date and
time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes
