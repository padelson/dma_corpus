    items of real or personal property held by Seller pursuant thereto), or for which Buyer
    will be liable as Seller&#146;s successor or transferee by reason of purchasing the Assets
    or assuming the Contracts. No Tax authority has asserted any claim for the assessment of
    any such Tax liability. Seller is not a foreign person for purposes of Section 1445(b)(2)
    of the Code. None of the Assets is subject to a &quot;safe harbor lease&quot; under former
    Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended before the Tax Reform
    Act of 1984. There are no Tax liens upon the Assets or any items of real or personal

    each such plan are in all material respects in compliance with applicable Law, and Seller
    has not received any written notice alleging to the contrary with respect to any such

    incurring) any liability in connection with any existing or previously existing Employee

        attached hereto, and will be completed within fourteen (14) days after the date of this
        Agreement (subject to extension for delays caused by Seller, including failure to provide
        reasonably requested information and access to Plant Sites in a timely manner).</li>
      <li>If the results of any Phase I Investigation indicate a &quot;recognized environmental
        condition&quot; (as that term is defined in ASTM E 1527-00 &#150; Standard Practice for
        Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessments Process) or other
        condition or violation of Environmental Law reasonably of concern to Buyer&#146;s
        environmental consultant, Buyer may request that Seller provide to Buyer and its agents
        access to conduct a &quot;phase II&quot; environmental investigation (&quot;Phase II
        Investigation&quot;). Seller may grant or deny such access with respect to any one or more
        Plant Sites in its sole discretion. If permitted by Seller, Buyer may engage a nationally
        recognized third party environmental consultant to conduct the Phase II Investigation,
        which Phase II Investigation shall be conducted at Buyer&#146;s expense and shall be
        completed by June 1, 2001. If a Phase II Investigation is not permitted by Seller with
        respect to any Plant Site, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in
        accordance with <u>Section 9.1(e)</u> hereof (and, in the event this Agreement is so
        terminated by Buyer, then Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for its actual
        out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with this transaction). </li>
      <li>Buyer shall, no later than 10 days prior to the Closing Date, advise Seller of any
        environmental condition or alleged environmental condition identified by the Phase I
        Investigation or Phase II Investigation that is of the type listed in Part 2 of <u>Exhibit
        5.9</u> and that affects any Plant Site (an &quot;Environmental Condition&quot;), and
        shall provide Seller with copies of the relevant portion of the Phase I Investigation
        report or the Phase II Investigation report and any related supporting documentation in
        Buyer&#146;s possession or control relating to any Environmental Conditions or alleged
        Environmental Condition.</li>
      <li>As to any Plant Site affected by an Environmental Condition or alleged Environmental
        Condition, Buyer and Seller shall engage in good faith negotiations, prior to Closing,

        or other corrective action required with respect thereto (a &quot;Remediation Plan&quot;).
        The parties expect that any agreed upon Remediation Plan will address Seller&#146;s pre-
        and post-Closing remediation obligations and special indemnification obligations in
        accordance with Part 3 of <u>Exhibit 5.9</u> attached hereto. In the event that the
        parties are unable to agree upon the existence of any alleged Environmental Condition and
        a Remediation Plan with respect thereto, then Buyer shall have the option of waiving such
        Environmental Condition or alleged Environmental Condition with no adjustment to the
        Purchase Price therefor (it being understood that Seller shall have no obligation to
        Buyer, its successors or assigns with respect to any Environmental Condition or alleged
        Environmental Condition that is so waived by Buyer or with respect to any Environmental
        Condition or alleged Environmental Condition identified in the Phase I Investigation or
        Phase II Investigation that is first asserted by Buyer after Closing). In the event that,
        at Closing, there remain any Environmental Conditions or alleged Environmental Conditions
        as to which Buyer and Seller have not agreed upon a Remediation Plan or that have not been
        waived by Buyer, then Seller (at its option) shall either: (i) accept Buyer&#146;s final

        such transfers. If any such transfer cannot be obtained prior to Closing, Buyer
        may&nbsp;in the exercise of its sole discretion waive such requirement as a condition to
        Closing, and Seller and Buyer shall continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts
        to obtain any such transfer as soon as possible after the Closing Date or otherwise obtain
        for Buyer the practical benefit of such Environmental Permits.</li>
      <li>Seller shall obtain such approvals, on terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, as are
        required by applicable state or local Environmental Laws (including without limitation the
        New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act) of a transferor of an interest in real property
        or shall have demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that no such approval
        is required. Seller shall give Buyer reasonable notice in advance of all meetings
        scheduled between Seller and state or local environmental authorities with respect to the
        foregoing and Buyer and Buyer's representatives shall have the right, without the
        obligation, to attend and participate in all such meetings. Seller shall promptly provide

        actively and diligently, (ii) if Seller or any Affiliate is also a party to the
        proceeding, the Buyer Indemnified Party has not determined in good faith that joint
        representation would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests
        between them and (iii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by
        Seller without the Buyer Indemnified Party&#146;s consent unless (A) there is no finding
        or admission of any violation of Law, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
        that are paid in full by Seller. If Seller has assumed the defense of such claim, the
        Buyer Indemnified Party may select counsel to participate in any defense, in which event
        the Buyer Indemnified Party&#146;s counsel shall be at the sole cost and expense of the
        Buyer Indemnified Party. In connection with any such claim, action or proceeding, the

        Buyer&#146;s right to be indemnified for the costs of such remedy pursuant to the
        provisions of <u>Section 8.1(a)(iv)</u> hereof), and (iv) obtain a complete release for
        the benefit of Seller from such claimant regarding such Product Warranty Claim.</li>
      <li>Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that Buyer&#146;s only direct claim against
        Seller with respect to environmental matters related to pre-Closing operation and
        ownership of the U.S. Display Business (including the use or condition of the Assets and
        the items of real or personal property held pursuant to the Contracts) is through
        indemnification, pursuant to <u>Section 8.1(a)(i)</u> hereof, for any breach of the
        representations and warranties set forth in <u>Section 3.19</u> hereof. In addition,
        Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer against third party claims against Buyer related to
        the pre-Closing operation or ownership of the U.S. Display Business (including with
        respect to third party environmental claims) pursuant to <u>Section 8.1(a)(iii)</u> and <u>8.1(a)(v)</u>
        hereof. Buyer and Seller have agreed that Buyer shall not initiate or otherwise instigate
        a third party claim with respect to such environmental matters with the purpose or effect
        of depriving Seller of the benefits of the limited claim period, &quot;deductible&quot; or
        &quot;cap&quot; that would apply to a claim for indemnification pursuant to <u>Section
        8.1(a)(i)</u> hereof except to the extent any such action is required by Law. Accordingly,
        Buyer shall not initiate or maintain any contacts with any Governmental Authorities or
        other third parties with respect to any potential third party environmental claims
        relating to the pre-Closing operation of the U.S. Display Business (including the use or
        condition of the Assets and the items of real or personal property held pursuant to the
        Contracts), or cooperate with such parties regarding any such claims, except as required
        by any Law. Buyer shall notify Seller of and provide a copy of all material requests for
        information, notices of violation, requests, demands, or orders that additional work be
        performed or any other communications to or from any Governmental Authorities or other
        third parties with respect to potential third party environmental claims relating to the
        pre-Closing operation of the U.S. Display Business; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that
        the failure to give such notice shall not relieve Seller of any indemnification obligation
        hereunder except to the extent Seller demonstrates that the defense of such claim or
        demand is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. If any Governmental
        Authorities or other third parties contact Buyer with respect to a potential third party
        environmental claim relating to the pre-Closing operation of the U.S. Display Business,
        Buyer shall cooperate reasonably with Seller in coordinating a response to such third
        party, so long as such response complies with all Laws and Seller is in compliance with
        its environmental indemnity obligations hereunder. Any successor to Buyer that wishes to
        enjoy the benefits of <u>Section 8.1(a)</u> hereof must by written instrument signed by
        such successor agree to be bound by the obligations of Buyer contained in this <u>Section
        8.1(e)</u>. </li>
      <li>Except for claims of fraud against Seller and except as set forth in <u>Section 2.3, 8.4</u>,
        <u>8.6</u> and <u>10.11</u> hereof, this <u>Section&nbsp;8.1</u> shall be the sole remedy
        of Buyer against Seller after Closing for any claim arising in connection with the
        transactions contemplated herein; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the parties hereto
        may enforce the Parent Guaranty and Non-Competition Agreement, the Transition Services
        Agreement and any other agreements specifically contemplated herein or entered into
        pursuant hereto in accordance with their terms. Seller&#146;s representations and
        warranties made herein shall survive the Closing, but only to the extent and for such time
        as is necessary to enable Buyer to enforce its rights to indemnification under this

    independent Persons (the &quot;Arbitrators&quot;), one selected by the Indemnifying Party,
    one selected by the Indemnified Party and one selected by the two Arbitrators so selected,

    the Indemnified Party will each submit to the Arbitrator(s) a written statement setting
    forth such party&#146;s proposed aggregate resolution of the dispute and any supporting
    data and analysis. The Arbitrators will select either the Indemnifying Party&#146;s or the
    Indemnified Party&#146;s proposed aggregate resolution of the dispute. The
    Arbitrator(s)&#146; determination shall be made within 30 days of the submission of the

    statement delivered to the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and shall be
    final, binding and conclusive. Judgment upon the decision rendered by the Arbitrator(s)
    may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof and may include the award of
    attorneys&#146; fees and other costs to the extent provided by this Article. The Person
    who is prevailed against in the resolution of such disagreement shall pay the fees and
    expenses of the Arbitrator(s) and the reasonable expenses of the other party (including
    attorneys&#146; fees) related to the arbitration. Any amount owing by any Person as a

        shall be at wage rates that are at least comparable to Seller&#146;s wage rates in effect
        on the Closing Date.</li>
      <li>(i) With respect to each Continuing Employee, Buyer agrees to offer vacation benefits
        and sick day and personal day policies to such Continuing Employee that are consistent
        with those currently offered by Seller, and to recognize such Continuing Employee&#146;s
        service with Seller for purposes of such policies. Buyer and Seller agree that the Initial
        Statement of Adjusted Working Capital and Final Statement of Adjusted Working Capital
        shall include accruals for vacation pay, sick days and personal days in accordance with
        the Special Accounting Principles.</li>
      <li>Buyer agrees that Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in a defined

        the Seller and Affiliates of the Seller prior to the Closing Date to the extent that such

        to be amended to fully vest each Continuing Employee in his account balances under
        Seller&#146;s Plan. Subject to the conditions prescribed by the following sentence, Buyer
        agrees that the Buyer&#146;s Plan will accept rollovers in the form of cash and any
        outstanding loan (provided that such loan is in good standing as of the date of the
        rollover) from the Seller&#146;s Plan on behalf of each Continuing Employee who directs
        that a rollover be made. The Buyer&#146;s Plan shall not be required to accept a rollover
        contribution in accordance with the preceding sentence unless the administrator of the
        Seller&#146;s Plan certifies with respect to such rollover that (A) the Seller&#146;s Plan
        has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering
        the Tax Reform Act of 1986, (B) the distribution from the Seller&#146;s Plan is an
        &quot;eligible rollover distribution&quot; as defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code,
        (C) no part of the distribution from the Seller&#146;s Plan to be rolled over is
        considered a return of employee after-Tax contributions, (D) the distribution from the
        Seller&#146;s Plan is not part of a series of periodic payments and (E) the distribution
        is not a &quot;required minimum payment&quot; under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code.</li>
      <li>Buyer agrees to provide welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (the
        &quot;Buyer&#146;s Welfare Plans&quot;) that provide benefits to Continuing Employees that
        are at least substantially equivalent to such benefits provided to similarly situated
        employees of Buyer immediately prior to the Closing Date. With respect to such Continuing
        Employees, and, as applicable, their beneficiaries and dependents, Buyer&#146;s Welfare
        Plans shall not include a waiting or eligibility period or a preexisting condition
        restriction or limitation (provided that any preexisting condition restriction or
        limitation under Seller&#146;s corresponding welfare benefit plans has been satisfied
        subject in all respects to the provision of the Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act of 1996). To the extent that such Continuing Employees or their
        dependents or beneficiaries have satisfied any deductibles of the Seller&#146;s Welfare
        Plans for the year that includes the Closing Date, such amounts will be credited toward
        the satisfaction of any such requirements under Buyer&#146;s Welfare Plans.</li>
      <li>Buyer agrees to adopt, with respect to the Continuing Employees only, a severance
        benefit plan that provides benefits that are identical in form and amount to Seller&#146;s
        severance benefit program listed on <u>Exhibit 3.13</u> attached hereto (provided that
        Buyer&#146;s plan shall provide benefits only to Continuing Employees terminated on or

        until at least December 31, 2001. Subject to <u>Section 8.10</u> below, Buyer agrees to
        pay (at Buyer&#146;s sole cost and expense) severance pay and other benefits to Continuing
        Employees terminated on or before December 31, 2001, under such severance benefit program,
        in accordance with the terms of such program, and Buyer will recognize service with the
        Seller and its Affiliates before the Effective Time of Closing for purposes of the payment
        of any severance pay.</li>
      <li>Seller agrees that it will perform its obligations, if any, under the Non-Compete and
        Confidentiality Agreements listed on <u>Exhibit 3.13</u> attached hereto, in accordance
        with the terms of such agreements in effect as of the Effective Time of Closing; <u>provided</u>,
        <u>however</u>, that Buyer agrees to reasonably assist Seller with Seller&#146;s efforts
        to mitigate its liabilities and obligations under such agreements.</li>
      <li>Buyer agrees to be solely responsible for, and to indemnify and hold Seller harmless
        from, all liabilities and obligations, including attorneys&#146; fees, under WARN or any
        other Law requiring notice prior to termination of employment or the payment of severance
        pay, wages or benefits as a result of or with respect to (i) the transactions contemplated

        actions or omissions occurring after the Closing Date (whether such actions alone or in

        <b><p>3. Recommendations Regarding Sprinklers at Erlanger</p>
        </b><p>At the time that Chesapeake acquired the Erlanger plant in 1996, our insurers, IRI,
        judged the building&#146;s sprinkler system to be adequate. In 1998, however, an IRI Loss
        Prevention Survey report indicated that the sprinkler system was of unacceptable design
        for the storage configuration. The area at issue was the racked warehousing in the north
        end of the plant, which had previously been used for incidental storage.</p>
        <p>Estimates for upgrading the sprinkler system range from $100,000 to $300,000. </p>
        <p>During the renewal of property coverage for the 6/01/00 to 6/01/01 term, IRI required
        an additional facultative premium of $42,000 for the Erlanger sprinkler system issue.</p>
