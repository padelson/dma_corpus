_Exhibit 3.3_ attached hereto, no notice to, filing or  registration with, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is 
necessary or is required to be made or obtained by Seller in connection with

performance of this Agreement, and the other documents and  instruments
required hereby to which Seller is a party, do not and will not (i)
constitute  a violation or breach of any contract or agreement to which

which are the subject of _Section 3.7_   hereof), or require the consent or
approval of any party to any such contract or  agreement, or give any party
to any such contract or agreement a right of termination,  cancellation,
acceleration or modification thereunder, except where such violation or 
breach or the failure to obtain such consent or approval would not, in the
aggregate, have  a material adverse effect on Sellers ability to consummate
the transactions  contemplated hereby or perform its obligations hereunder,
or (ii) result in, require or  permit the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon or with respect to the Assets or the  items of real or personal property
held by Seller pursuant to the Contracts.

personal property held by Seller pursuant to the Contracts). Except as set 
forth on _Exhibit 1.6_ , attached hereto, no such litigation is included among
the  Assumed Liabilities. No such litigation seeks restraint, prohibition,

negative impact on the volume of business conducted with the U.S.  Display

Knowledge of Seller, each of the other parties to the  Contracts, has
performed each material term, covenant and condition of each of the 
Contracts which is to be performed by it at or before the date hereof. No

or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any  other Person under any of the Contracts.
To the Knowledge of Seller, no party to any of  the Contracts intends to
cancel, terminate, accelerate the maturity or performance of or  exercise any
option or other remedy under any of the material Contracts. Except as set 
forth in _Exhibit 3.7_ attached hereto, the execution, delivery and
performance of  this Agreement, and the other documents and instruments
required hereby to which Seller is  a party, do not and will not (i)
constitute a violation or breach of any material  Contract, or require the
consent or approval of any party to any such Contract or give any  party to
any such Contract a right of termination, cancellation, acceleration or 
modification thereunder, or (ii) result in, require or permit the creation or

course of business; the Accounts are expected to be collectible in
accordance  with normal trade practice, net of the reserve for uncollectible
accounts reflected on the  books of Seller therefor (including, when
delivered to Buyer, the Final Statement of  Adjusted Working Capital); such
reserve has been determined in a manner consistent with  GAAP and the current
practices of Seller, subject to the Special Accounting Principles;  and, to
the Knowledge of Seller, there are no contests, claims or rights of set-off
(other  than returns in the ordinary course of business) relating to the
amount or validity of any  Account, other than as reflected on the books of
Seller (it being understood that this  Section shall not constitute a
guaranty of collection of any Accounts). Except as set  forth in _Exhibit
3.8_ attached hereto, there are no pending or, to the  Knowledge of Seller,
threatened disputes or claims between Seller and any Account obligor  outside
of the ordinary course of business and relating to any Account.

operating condition and repair for facilities of like type and age,  subject
to ordinary wear and tear and Sellers customary maintenance schedules, and 
are substantially fit for the purposes for which they currently are being
utilized. Each  material item of Equipment, and the Equipment taken as a
whole, is in good operating  condition and repair for equipment of like type
and age, subject to ordinary wear and tear  and Sellers customary
maintenance schedules, and is substantially fit for the  purposes for which

  _ 

 2. Exhibit 3.10_ attached hereto contains the projected income statements for the U.S.  Display Business for the three-year period ending December 31, 2003. Such projections have  been prepared in good faith by Seller based upon assumptions that were reasonable when  made and accurate historical data. The assumptions used in the preparation of such  projections continue to be reasonable as of the date hereof.
 

 3. The Interim Financial Statements, when delivered pursuant to _Section 5.13(a) hereof_ ,  shall be true and correct in all material respects, and present fairly the financial  position and results of operations of the U.S. Display Business as of the dates and for  the periods specified therein, and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a  basis consistent with the current practice of Seller, subject to the Special Accounting  Principles.
   

 11. Section 3.11. _Compliance with Law_. 
 

The current conduct of the U.S. Display Business (including Sellers current
use  of its Assets and any items of real or personal property held by Seller
pursuant to the  Contracts, and Sellers performance under the Contracts)
does not violate or conflict  with any Law in any material respect. All
material Permits required by Seller to conduct  its U.S. Display Business
have been obtained, are in full force and effect and are being  complied with
in all material respects. Except as set forth in _Exhibit 1.49_  attached
hereto, consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not,  with respect to any material Permit (other than any Environmental
Permit), require the  consent or approval of, or any filing with, any
Governmental Authority, and all such  material Permits will continue in full
force and effect immediately after the Effective  Time of Closing in
accordance with their terms. No event (other than the consummation of  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) has occurred or circumstance
exists that,  to the Knowledge of Seller (with or without notice or lapse of
time), would result in the  revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation,
termination of or any material  modification to any material Permit. Seller
has delivered to Buyer complete copies of each  material Permit (other than
Environmental Permits).

 

 12. Section 3.12. _Taxes_.  
 

Seller has filed all required Tax Returns relating to the U.S. Display
Business, the  Assets and the Contracts. All such Tax Returns are correct and
complete in all material  respects. There are no unpaid Taxes due and
payable, the non-payment of which could  adversely affect any of the Assets
or the use thereof or the Contracts (including any  items of real or personal
property held by Seller pursuant thereto), or for which Buyer  will be liable
as Sellers successor or transferee by reason of purchasing the Assets  or
assuming the Contracts. No Tax authority has asserted any claim for the
assessment of  any such Tax liability. Seller is not a foreign person for
purposes of Section 1445(b)(2)  of the Code. None of the Assets is subject to
a "safe harbor lease" under former  Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended before the Tax Reform  Act of 1984. There are no Tax
liens upon the Assets or any items of real or personal  property held by
Seller pursuant to the Contracts, except liens for Taxes not yet due.  Except
as set forth on _Exhibit 3.12_ attached hereto, there are no matters under 
discussion between any Governmental Authority and Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller with  respect to any additional Taxes relating to the U.S. Display
Business. No claim for past  due Taxes relating to the U.S. Display Business
has been made within the last five years  by any Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where Seller does not file Tax Returns.

 

 13. Section 3.13. _Employment Agreements and Benefits_. 
  _

Exhibit 3.13_ attached hereto is a true and complete list of all agreements 
relating to the compensation and other benefits of persons who are currently
Employees,  salesmen, consultants and other agents of Seller relating to the
use of the Assets, the  Contracts or the U.S. Display Business under which
Seller has any continuing liability,  including, without limitation,
collective bargaining agreements and pension, retirement,  bonus, stock
option, profit sharing, health, disability, life insurance, hospitalization, 
education or other similar plans or arrangements (whether or not subject to
ERISA), true  copies of which have been delivered by Seller to Buyer. None of
the agreements listed on _Exhibit  3.13_ will be breached by Sellers
execution, delivery and performance of this  Agreement. Except as
contemplated in _Section 8.6_ hereof, no such agreements require  Buyer to
assume any employment, compensation, fringe benefit, pension, profit sharing
or  deferred compensation agreement or plan in respect of any employee of
Seller.  Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) contributed to, been
required to  contribute to, or maintained a "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in ERISA Section  3(37) or 4001(a)(3)) or (ii) had any complete or partial
withdrawal from any multiemployer  plan that could result, directly or
indirectly, in any withdrawal liability under Subtitle  E of Title IV of
ERISA that would become, on or after the Closing Date, an obligation or 
liability of Buyer. The provisions of each Employee Benefit Plan and the
administration of  each such plan are in all material respects in compliance
with applicable Law, and Seller  has not received any written notice alleging
to the contrary with respect to any such  plan. Except as set forth on
_Exhibit 3.13_ attached hereto, there is no action,  claim or demand of any
kind (other than routine claims for benefits) that has been brought  or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, is proposed or threatened, against any Employee
Benefit  Plan or the assets thereof, or against the fiduciary of any such
plan. Except as  contemplated in _Section 8.6_ hereof, neither Seller nor any
ERISA Affiliate has  incurred (nor has any event occurred that could result
in Seller or any ERISA Affiliate  incurring) any liability in connection with
any existing or previously existing Employee  Benefit Plan that could become,
on or after the Closing Date, an obligation or liability  of Buyer. For
purposes of this Section, "ERISA Affiliate" means any Affiliate of  Seller,
within the meaning of Section 414(b), 414(c), 414(m), or 414(o) of the Code,
or  Section 4001(b) of ERISA.

 

 14. Section 3.14. _Labor  Matters_.

Any Phase I Investigation will be conducted at Buyers expense  in accordance with the specifications set forth in Part 1 of _Exhibit 5.9_  attached hereto, and will be completed within fourteen (14) days after the date of this  Agreement (subject to extension for delays caused by Seller, including failure to provide  reasonably requested information and access to Plant Sites in a timely manner).

If permitted by Seller, Buyer may engage a nationally  recognized third party environmental consultant to conduct the Phase II Investigation,  which Phase II Investigation shall be conducted at Buyers expense and shall be  completed by June 1, 2001.

The parties expect that any agreed upon Remediation Plan will address Sellers pre-  and post-Closing remediation obligations and special indemnification obligations in  accordance with Part 3 of _Exhibit 5.9_ attached hereto. In the event that the  parties are unable to agree upon the existence of any alleged Environmental Condition and  a Remediation Plan with respect thereto, then Buyer shall have the option of waiving such  Environmental Condition or alleged Environmental Condition with no adjustment to the  Purchase Price therefor (it being understood that Seller shall have no obligation to  Buyer, its successors or assigns with respect to any Environmental Condition or alleged  Environmental Condition that is so waived by Buyer or with respect to any Environmental  Condition or alleged Environmental Condition identified in the Phase I Investigation or  Phase II Investigation that is first asserted by Buyer after Closing). In the event that,  at Closing, there remain any Environmental Conditions or alleged Environmental Conditions  as to which Buyer and Seller have not agreed upon a Remediation Plan or that have not been  waived by Buyer, then Seller (at its option) shall either: (i) accept Buyers final  proposed Remediation Plan with respect to all unresolved Environmental Conditions, and the  parties shall proceed to Closing; or (ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)_  hereof.
 

 5. Seller and Buyer shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to transfer to  (or, if not transferable, make otherwise available to) Buyer all material Environmental  Permits; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall pay all costs associated with  such transfers. If any such transfer cannot be obtained prior to Closing, Buyer  may in the exercise of its sole discretion waive such requirement as a condition to  Closing, and Seller and Buyer shall continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts  to obtain any such transfer as soon as possible after the Closing Date or otherwise obtain  for Buyer the practical benefit of such Environmental Permits.
 

 6. Seller shall obtain such approvals, on terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, as are  required by applicable state or local Environmental Laws (including without limitation the  New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act) of a transferor of an interest in real property  or shall have demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that no such approval  is required. Seller shall give Buyer reasonable notice in advance of all meetings  scheduled between Seller and state or local environmental authorities with respect to the  foregoing and Buyer and Buyer\'s representatives shall have the right, without the  obligation, to attend and participate in all such meetings. Seller shall promptly provide  to Buyer copies of all documents and correspondence to and from such environmental  authorities relating to such matters.
   

 10. Section 5.10. _Employment Agreements with Key Employees_.  
 

Seller agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to assist and cooperate with
Buyer in  encouraging the key Employees identified by Buyer to execute
employment agreements or  otherwise agree to become employed by Buyer. Buyer
shall notify Seller of the identity of  such key Employees within twenty (20)
days after the date hereof.

 

 11. Section 5.11. _Exclusivity_.

ordinary course of business as permitted  hereunder) or Sellers capital
stock or (ii) any business combination with  Seller, (b) encourage, solicit,
engage in negotiations or discussions with, or  provide information with
respect to any inquiries or proposals relating to the foregoing  clauses (i)

necessary  in connection with this transaction, and except to the extent that
such information  becomes public other than as result of a violation hereof),
with any Person other than  Buyer without the prior written approval of
Buyer.

 1. **Section 8.1. _Seller s  Indemnity_.
   

 1. Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer, its Affiliates  and their respective officers, directors, managers, members, employees and agents  (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and  agrees to defend promptly the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and to reimburse the Buyer  Indemnified Parties for, any and all losses, damages, costs, diminution in value,  expenses, liabilities, obligations and claims of any kind, including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys fees and other legal costs and expenses (hereinafter referred  to collectively as "Losses"), that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may at any time  suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in connection with (i) any  breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by Seller in or  pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that (i) the "except for" clause  in _Section 6.4_ hereof and (ii) any waiver by Buyer of the condition to Closing set  forth in _Section 6.4_ hereof shall not, in either case, in any way be deemed a  waiver of Buyers right to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(i)_   for a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty made by Seller), (ii) any  failure by Seller to perform any of its covenants and obligations set forth in this  Agreement or in any agreement, document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto (it being  understood that (i) the "material" qualifiers in _Section 6.1_ hereof and  (ii) any waiver by Buyer of the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_   hereof shall not, in either case, in any way be deemed a waiver of Buyers right to  indemnification pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ for the failure by Seller to  perform any of its covenants or obligations set forth herein), (iii) claims by third  parties against the Buyer Indemnified Parties relating to the operation and ownership by  Seller of the Assets and the use of the items of real or personal property held by Seller  pursuant to the Contracts, the performance by Seller under the Contracts and the conduct  of its U.S. Display Business prior to the Effective Time of Closing, (iv) product warranty  claims asserted by customers of the U.S. Display Business relating to products designed,  manufactured, constructed, distributed, sold, leased, supported or installed by Seller or  services performed by Seller prior to the Effective Time of Closing ("Product  Warranty Claims"), and (v) any other liability of Seller to third parties, other than  any Assumed Liability (including without limitation any liability that becomes, or is  alleged to have become, a liability of Buyer under any applicable bulk sales law, under  any doctrine of de facto merger or successor liability, or otherwise by operation of Law);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer  Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.1((a))(i)_ hereof in respect of the  representations and warranties made by Seller unless such right to indemnification is  asserted by the Buyer Indemnified Parties (whether or not such Losses have actually been  incurred) by written notice to Seller within the following time periods:
 

(1) with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.6_   and _3.8_ hereof, on or before March 31, 2002;

 

(2) with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.19_   hereof, within 36 months after the Closing Date;

 

(3) with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
3.12_  and _3.13_ hereof, insofar as they related to compliance with Tax Laws
and ERISA,  within 30 days after expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to  the underlying Law which forms the basis of such
claim (including all extensions thereof  agreed to with Tax authorities);

 

(4) with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.2_   and the first two sentences of _Section 3.4_ hereof, without time
limitations; and

 

(5) with respect to all other representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_  hereof, on or before March 31, 2003.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to indemnify the
Buyer  Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.1((a))(i)_ in respect of
the  representations and warranties made by Seller or pursuant to _Section
8.1((a))(iv)_   hereof with respect to Product Warranty Claims unless and
until the amount of all Losses  for which indemnification is sought hereunder
first exceeds $250,000, in which event all  Losses in excess of such amount
shall be subject to indemnification. Sellers  aggregate obligation pursuant
to _Section 8.1((a))(i)_ and _Section  8.1((a))(iv)_ shall in no event
exceed an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the  Final Purchase Price.

 

 2. The amounts for which Seller shall be liable under _Section 8.1((a))_ hereof  shall be net of any insurance proceeds received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in  connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (less any  retroactive insurance premiums or other premium increase, where such increase results  directly from the filing or payment of any insurance claim related thereto).
 

 3. In the event a claim or demand by or from a third party against any Buyer Indemnified  Party arises that is covered by the indemnity provisions of _Section 8.1((a))_  of this Agreement, notice shall be promptly given by the Buyer Indemnified Party to  Seller. The failure of the Buyer Indemnified Party to promptly notify Seller shall not  relieve Seller of any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent Seller  demonstrates that the defense of such claim or demand is materially prejudiced by the  failure to give such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not  apply to notices given after the expiration of the time periods specified in _Section  8.1(a) (1), (2), (3)_ and _(5)_ hereof. Provided that Seller admits in writing to  the party seeking indemnification that such claim is covered by the indemnity provisions  of _Section 8.1((a))_ hereof, Seller shall have the right to contest and defend  by all appropriate legal proceedings such claim and to control all settlements (unless the  Buyer Indemnified Party agrees to assume the cost of settlement and to forgo such  indemnity) and to select lead counsel to defend any and all such claims at the sole cost  and expense of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) counsel selected by  Seller is reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer Indemnified Party and conducts the defense  actively and diligently, (ii) if Seller or any Affiliate is also a party to the  proceeding, the Buyer Indemnified Party has not determined in good faith that joint  representation would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests  between them and (iii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by  Seller without the Buyer Indemnified Partys consent unless (A) there is no finding  or admission of any violation of Law, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages  that are paid in full by Seller. If Seller has assumed the defense of such claim, the  Buyer Indemnified Party may select counsel to participate in any defense, in which event  the Buyer Indemnified Partys counsel shall be at the sole cost and expense of the  Buyer Indemnified Party. In connection with any such claim, action or proceeding, the  parties shall cooperate with each other and provide each other with access to relevant  books and records in their possession.
 

 4. Notwithstanding _Section 8.1(c)_ hereof, Buyer shall have the right to control all  communications with customers of the U.S. Display Business regarding Product Warranty  Claims and to control all settlements related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that Buyer shall (i) consult with Seller as to the appropriate credit to be issued, or  services or products to be provided, to the claimant in order to remedy the alleged  Product Warranty Claim, (ii) use its good faith commercially reasonable efforts to  mitigate the cost of such remedy, (iii) provide such remedy to the claimant (subject to  Buyers right to be indemnified for the costs of such remedy pursuant to the  provisions of _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ hereof), and (iv) obtain a complete release for  the benefit of Seller from such claimant regarding such Product Warranty Claim.
 

 5. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that Buyers only direct claim against  Seller with respect to environmental matters related to pre-Closing operation and  ownership of the U.S. Display Business (including the use or condition of the Assets and  the items of real or personal property held pursuant to the Contracts) is through  indemnification, pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(i)_ hereof, for any breach of the  representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.19_ hereof. In addition,  Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer against third party claims against Buyer related to  the pre-Closing operation or ownership of the U.S. Display Business (including with  respect to third party environmental claims) pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ and _8.1(a)(v)_   hereof. Buyer and Seller have agreed that Buyer shall not initiate or otherwise instigate  a third party claim with respect to such environmental matters with the purpose or effect  of depriving Seller of the benefits of the limited claim period, "deductible" or  "cap" that would apply to a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section  8.1(a)(i)_ hereof except to the extent any such action is required by Law. Accordingly,  Buyer shall not initiate or maintain any contacts with any Governmental Authorities or  other third parties with respect to any potential third party environmental claims  relating to the pre-Closing operation of the U.S. Display Business (including the use or  condition of the Assets and the items of real or personal property held pursuant to the  Contracts), or cooperate with such parties regarding any such claims, except as required  by any Law. Buyer shall notify Seller of and provide a copy of all material requests for  information, notices of violation, requests, demands, or orders that additional work be  performed or any other communications to or from any Governmental Authorities or other  third parties with respect to potential third party environmental claims relating to the  pre-Closing operation of the U.S. Display Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that  the failure to give such notice shall not relieve Seller of any indemnification obligation  hereunder except to the extent Seller demonstrates that the defense of such claim or  demand is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. If any Governmental  Authorities or other third parties contact Buyer with respect to a potential third party  environmental claim relating to the pre-Closing operation of the U.S. Display Business,  Buyer shall cooperate reasonably with Seller in coordinating a response to such third  party, so long as such response complies with all Laws and Seller is in compliance with  its environmental indemnity obligations hereunder. Any successor to Buyer that wishes to  enjoy the benefits of _Section 8.1(a)_ hereof must by written instrument signed by  such successor agree to be bound by the obligations of Buyer contained in this _Section  8.1(e)_. 
 

 6. Except for claims of fraud against Seller and except as set forth in _Section 2.3, 8.4_ ,  _8.6_ and _10.11_ hereof, this _Section 8.1_ shall be the sole remedy  of Buyer against Seller after Closing for any claim arising in connection with the  transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto  may enforce the Parent Guaranty and Non-Competition Agreement, the Transition Services  Agreement and any other agreements specifically contemplated herein or entered into  pursuant hereto in accordance with their terms. Sellers representations and  warranties made herein shall survive the Closing, but only to the extent and for such time  as is necessary to enable Buyer to enforce its rights to indemnification under this  Section.
   

 2. Section 8.2. _Buyer s Indemnity_.
   

 1. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller, its Affiliates  and their respective officers, directors, managers, members, employees and agents  (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and  agrees to defend promptly the Seller Indemnified Parties from and to reimburse the Seller  Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties may at any  time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in connection with  (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by  Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that (i) the "except  for" clause in _Section 7.4_ hereof and (ii) any waiver by Seller of the  condition to Closing set forth in _Section 7.4_ hereof shall not, in either case, in  any way be deemed a waiver of Sellers right to indemnification pursuant to this _Section  8.2(a)(i)_ for a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty made by Buyer),  (ii) any failure by Buyer to perform any of its covenants and obligations set forth  in this Agreement or in any agreement, document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto  (it being understood that (i) the "material" qualifiers in _Section 7.1_   hereof and (ii) any waiver by Seller of the condition to Closing set forth in _Section  7.1_ hereof shall not, in either case, in any way be deemed a waiver of Sellers  right to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ for the failure by  Buyer to perform any of its covenants or obligations set forth herein), and  (iii) claims by third parties against the Seller Indemnified Parties relating to the  operation and ownership by Buyer of the Assets and the use of the items of real or  personal property held by Seller pursuant to the Contracts, the performance by Buyer under  the Contracts, the Assumed Liabilities and the conduct of Buyers business from and  after the Effective Time of Closing (including, but not limited to, any product warranty  claims relating to products designed, manufactured, constructed, distributed, sold,  leased, supported or installed by Buyer or services performed by Buyer after the Effective  Time of Closing), _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to  indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2((a))(i)_  hereof in respect of the representations and warranties made by Buyer unless such right to  indemnification is asserted by the Seller Indemnified Parties (whether or not such Losses  have actually been incurred) by written notice to Buyer within the following time periods:
 

(1) with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.2_   hereof, without time limitations; and

 

(2) with respect to all other representations and warranties set forth in
_Article IV_   hereof, on or before March 31, 2003.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to indemnify the
Seller  Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2((a))(i)_ in respect of
the  representations and warranties made by Buyer unless and until the amount
of all Losses for  which such indemnification is sought hereunder first
exceeds $250,000, in which event all  Losses in excess of such amount shall
be subject to indemnification. Buyers  aggregate obligation pursuant to
_Section 8.2((a))(i)_ shall in no event exceed  an amount equal to thirty
percent (30%) of the Final Purchase Price.

 

 2. The amounts for which Buyer shall be liable under _Section 8.2((a))_ hereof  shall be net of any insurance proceeds received by the Seller Indemnified Parties in  connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (less any  retroactive insurance premiums or other premium increase, where such increase results  directly from the filing or payment of any insurance claim related thereto).
 

 3. In the event a claim or demand by or from a third party against any Seller Indemnified  Party arises that is covered by the indemnity provisions of _Section 8.2((a))_  of this Agreement, notice shall be promptly given by the Seller Indemnified Party to  Buyer. The failure of the Seller Indemnified Party to promptly notify Buyer shall not  relieve Buyer of any indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent Buyer  demonstrates that the defense of such claim or demand is materially prejudiced by the  failure to give such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not  apply to notices given after the expiration of the time period specified in _Section 8.2(a)(2)_  hereof. Provided that Buyer admits in writing to Seller that such claim is covered by the  indemnity provisions of _Section 8.2((a))_ hereof, Buyer shall have the right to  contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings such claim and to control all  settlements (unless the Seller Indemnified Party agrees to assume the cost of settlement  and to forgo such indemnity) and to select lead counsel to defend any and all such claims  at the sole cost and expense of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) counsel  selected by Buyer is reasonably satisfactory to the Seller Indemnified Party and conducts  the defense actively and diligently, (ii) if Buyer or any Affiliate is also a party to the  proceeding, the Seller Indemnified Party has not determined in good faith that joint  representation would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests  between them and (iii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by Buyer  without the Seller Indemnified Partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or  admission of any violation of Law, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages  that are paid in full by Buyer. If Buyer has assumed the defense of such claim, the Seller  Indemnified Party may select counsel to participate in any defense, in which event the  Seller Indemnified Partys counsel shall be at the sole cost and expense of the  Seller Indemnified Party. In connection with any such claim, action or proceeding, the  parties shall cooperate with each other and provide each other with access to relevant  books and records in their possession.
 

 4. Except for claims of fraud against Buyer and except as provided in _Sections 2.3, 8.6_ ,  _8.9_ , and _8.10_ and _10.11_ hereof, this _Section 8.2_ shall be the  sole remedy of Seller against Buyer after Closing for any claim arising in connection with  the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties  hereto may enforce the Parent Guaranty and Non-Competition Agreement, the Transition  Services Agreement and any other agreements specifically contemplated herein or entered  into pursuant hereto in accordance with their terms. Buyers representations and  warranties made herein shall survive the Closing, but only to the extent and for such time  as is necessary to enable Seller to enforce its rights to indemnification under this  Section.
   

 3. Section 8.3. _Arbitration  of Indemnity Claims_. 
 

Any party making a claim for indemnity under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 hereof, other
than  third-party claims (an "Indemnified Party"), shall notify the party
against whom  the claim is made (either Buyer or Seller) (the "Indemnifying
Party") in writing  of the basis for such claim setting forth the nature and
amount of the damages resulting  from such claim. Notice of any such claim
shall be given reasonably promptly after the  Indemnified Party becomes aware
of the facts or circumstances giving rise to such claim.  The Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice of any disagreement with such claim  within
30 days following receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of the claim, 
specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such disagreement. If
the  Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve any
disagreement within  30 days following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of
the notice referred to in the  preceding sentence, the disagreement shall be
submitted for resolution to an independent  Person (the "Arbitrator")
mutually agreed by the Indemnifying Party and the  Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party cannot agree on a  single
arbitrator, then the disagreement shall be submitted to a panel of three 
independent Persons (the "Arbitrators"), one selected by the Indemnifying
Party,  one selected by the Indemnified Party and one selected by the two
Arbitrators so selected,  and shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules
of the American Arbitration  Association. Any such arbitration shall be held
in Raleigh, North Carolina, or such other  location to which the parties to
such dispute mutually agree. The Indemnifying Party and  the Indemnified
Party will each submit to the Arbitrator(s) a written statement setting 
forth such partys proposed aggregate resolution of the dispute and any
supporting  data and analysis. The Arbitrators will select either the
Indemnifying Partys or the  Indemnified Partys proposed aggregate
resolution of the dispute. The  Arbitrator(s) determination shall be made
within 30 days of the submission of the  dispute, shall be in accordance with
this Agreement, shall be set forth in a written  statement delivered to the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and shall be  final, binding and
conclusive. Judgment upon the decision rendered by the Arbitrator(s)  may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof and may include the award
of  attorneys fees and other costs to the extent provided by this Article.
The Person  who is prevailed against in the resolution of such disagreement
shall pay the fees and  expenses of the Arbitrator(s) and the reasonable
expenses of the other party (including  attorneys fees) related to the
arbitration. Any amount owing by any Person as a  result of this _Section
8.3_ **** shall be paid within two Business Days after  final determination
of such amount.

 

 4. Section 8.4. _Bulk Sales Compliance_. 
 

Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller
with the  provisions of the bulk sales laws of any state (including any such
laws relating to  Taxes), insofar as any such laws may apply to the
transactions contemplated herein. Seller  hereby covenants and agrees to pay
and discharge when due all claims of creditors that  could be asserted
against Buyer by reason of such non-compliance. Seller hereby agrees to 
indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against and shall on demand
reimburse Buyer for  any and all Losses suffered by Buyer by reason of
Sellers failure to pay and  discharge any such claims.

 

 5. Section 8.5. _Additional Instruments_. 
 

At any time and from time to time on and after the Closing, at either
partys  request and without further consideration, Seller or Buyer, as the
case may be, shall  execute and deliver such other instruments of sale,
transfer, conveyance, assignment and  confirmation and take such other action
as Seller or Buyer may reasonably deem necessary  or desirable in order to
more effectively transfer, convey and assign to Buyer, and to  confirm
Buyers title to and interest in, and obligations with respect to, the 
Assets, the Contracts and the Assumed Liabilities, and the consummation of
the  transactions contemplated herein.

 

 6. Section 8.6. _Employment Matters_.
   

 1. Buyer and Seller have agreed that Seller shall be solely responsible for all liabilities  or obligations of any kind with respect to the Employees for matters occurring on or prior  to the Closing Date, including but not limited to any claims by any Employees related to  their employment by Seller or to the termination of their employment by Seller prior to  and as of the Effective Time of Closing.

Except as  specifically set forth in _Sections 8.6(c)_ and _8.6(d)_ below, Buyer shall not  be obligated under and hereby specifically disclaims any assumption or liability with  respect to any collective bargaining agreement, employment contract or Employee Benefit  Plan to which Seller is a party or under which any of the Employees are covered. Buyer and  Seller have agreed that Buyer shall be solely responsible for all liabilities or  obligations of any kind with respect to Continuing Employees for matters occurring after  the Closing Date, including but not limited to any claims by any Continuing Employees  related to their employment by Buyer or to the termination of their employment by Buyer  after the Effective Time of Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing  sentence, Buyer shall be solely responsible for the following matters related to  Buyers employment of Continuing Employees and the termination of such employment:  except as provided in _Section 8.6(i)_ hereof, any required compliance after Closing  with WARN; any required compliance with COBRA for qualifying events (as defined in Code  section 4980B) occurring after the Effective Time of Closing; and all alleged and actual  obligations and claims arising from or relating to any employment agreement, collective  bargaining agreement or Employee Benefit Plans, any grievances, arbitrations or unfair  labor practice charges and relating to compliance with any applicable state or federal  labor or employment law (including but not limited to all laws pertaining to  discrimination, workers compensation, unemployment compensation, occupational safety  and health, unfair labor practices, family and medical leave, and wages, hours or employee  benefits) for events occurring after the Effective Time of Closing.
 

 2. Seller agrees to terminate, as of the Effective Time of Closing, the employment of any  of its Employees to whom it does not intend to offer employment in its other operations.  Except as specifically provided in _Section 8.6(d)_ hereof, Seller agrees to satisfy  all compensation, severance pay, vacation pay, sick pay and other obligations under  applicable Law with respect to its Employees, including any obligation to bargain with any  union representing its Employees with respect to the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, the effects thereof, and, if required, the decision to enter into this  Agreement. Except to the extent specifically set forth in _Sections 8.6(c)_ and _8.6(d)_   below, Buyer shall have no liability or obligation with respect to the Employees.
 

 3. Buyer agrees to offer employment, as of the Effective Time of Closing, to all persons  who are actively employed by Seller immediately prior to the Effective Time of Closing,  and to all inactive Employees who are receiving disability or workers compensation  benefits as of the date such Employee is eligible to return to work; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that no such Employee shall be offered employment under this provision after six months  following the Closing Date and Buyer shall not be required, at Closing or any time  thereafter, to offer employment to former employees of Seller who have been laid off by  Seller prior to the Effective Time of Closing. Buyer agrees that the offers of employment  shall be at wage rates that are at least comparable to Sellers wage rates in effect  on the Closing Date.
 

 4. (i) With respect to each Continuing Employee, Buyer agrees to offer vacation benefits  and sick day and personal day policies to such Continuing Employee that are consistent  with those currently offered by Seller, and to recognize such Continuing Employees  service with Seller for purposes of such policies. Buyer and Seller agree that the Initial  Statement of Adjusted Working Capital and Final Statement of Adjusted Working Capital  shall include accruals for vacation pay, sick days and personal days in accordance with  the Special Accounting Principles.
 

 5. Buyer agrees that Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in a defined  contribution plan that is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code and shall  recognize, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting purposes, service with  the Seller and Affiliates of the Seller prior to the Closing Date to the extent that such  service is recognized under Sellers Plan. Seller agrees to cause Sellers Plan  to be amended to fully vest each Continuing Employee in his account balances under  Sellers Plan. Subject to the conditions prescribed by the following sentence, Buyer  agrees that the Buyers Plan will accept rollovers in the form of cash and any  outstanding loan (provided that such loan is in good standing as of the date of the  rollover) from the Sellers Plan on behalf of each Continuing Employee who directs  that a rollover be made. The Buyers Plan shall not be required to accept a rollover  contribution in accordance with the preceding sentence unless the administrator of the  Sellers Plan certifies with respect to such rollover that (A) the Sellers Plan  has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering  the Tax Reform Act of 1986, (B) the distribution from the Sellers Plan is an  "eligible rollover distribution" as defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code,  (C) no part of the distribution from the Sellers Plan to be rolled over is  considered a return of employee after-Tax contributions, (D) the distribution from the  Sellers Plan is not part of a series of periodic payments and (E) the distribution  is not a "required minimum payment" under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code.
 

 6. Buyer agrees to provide welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (the  "Buyers Welfare Plans") that provide benefits to Continuing Employees that  are at least substantially equivalent to such benefits provided to similarly situated  employees of Buyer immediately prior to the Closing Date. With respect to such Continuing  Employees, and, as applicable, their beneficiaries and dependents, Buyers Welfare  Plans shall not include a waiting or eligibility period or a preexisting condition  restriction or limitation (provided that any preexisting condition restriction or  limitation under Sellers corresponding welfare benefit plans has been satisfied  subject in all respects to the provision of the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996). To the extent that such Continuing Employees or their  dependents or beneficiaries have satisfied any deductibles of the Sellers Welfare  Plans for the year that includes the Closing Date, such amounts will be credited toward  the satisfaction of any such requirements under Buyers Welfare Plans.
 

 7. Buyer agrees to adopt, with respect to the Continuing Employees only, a severance  benefit plan that provides benefits that are identical in form and amount to Sellers  severance benefit program listed on _Exhibit 3.13_ attached hereto (provided that  Buyers plan shall provide benefits only to Continuing Employees terminated on or  before December 31, 2001), and agrees to keep such severance benefit program in effect  until at least December 31, 2001. Subject to _Section 8.10_ below, Buyer agrees to  pay (at Buyers sole cost and expense) severance pay and other benefits to Continuing  Employees terminated on or before December 31, 2001, under such severance benefit program,  in accordance with the terms of such program, and Buyer will recognize service with the  Seller and its Affiliates before the Effective Time of Closing for purposes of the payment  of any severance pay.
 

 8. Seller agrees that it will perform its obligations, if any, under the Non-Compete and  Confidentiality Agreements listed on _Exhibit 3.13_ attached hereto, in accordance  with the terms of such agreements in effect as of the Effective Time of Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer agrees to reasonably assist Seller with Sellers efforts  to mitigate its liabilities and obligations under such agreements.
 

 9. Buyer agrees to be solely responsible for, and to indemnify and hold Seller harmless  from, all liabilities and obligations, including attorneys fees, under WARN or any  other Law requiring notice prior to termination of employment or the payment of severance  pay, wages or benefits as a result of or with respect to (i) the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, and (ii) layoffs, employment terminations or other employment related  actions or omissions occurring after the Closing Date (whether such actions alone or in  conjunction with the employment related actions by the Seller before Closing give rise to  such liabilities or obligations).
   

 7. Section 8.7. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. 
 

The Initial Purchase Price _plus_ the Assumed Liabilities (to the extent
they  constitute part of the amount realized by Seller for federal income Tax
purposes) shall be  allocated among the Assets and the Contracts as mutually
agreed upon by the parties prior  to Closing, which the parties shall adjust
to reflect any differences between the Final  Purchase Price and the Initial
Purchase Price. This allocation is intended to comply with  the allocation
method required by Section 1060 of the Code. The parties shall cooperate to 
comply with all requirements of Section 1060 and the regulations thereunder,
and once the  allocation has been adjusted to reflect the Final Purchase
Price, the allocation shall be  adjusted only if and to the extent necessary
to comply with such requirements. Buyer and  Seller agree that they will not
take nor will they permit any affiliated person to take,  for income Tax
purposes, any position inconsistent with such allocation; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that (i) Buyers total cost for the Assets may differ from the
total amount allocated  hereunder to reflect Buyers transaction costs other
than the Final Purchase Price  and Assumed Liabilities, and (ii) the amount
realized by Seller may differ from the total  amount allocated hereunder to
reflect Sellers transaction costs that reduce the  amount realized for
income tax purposes.

 

 8. Section 8.8. _Access to Books and Records_. 
 

From and after the Closing, Buyer will authorize and permit Seller and its 
representatives to have access during normal business hours, upon reasonable
notice and  for reasonable purposes and in such manner as will not
unreasonably interfere with the  conduct of Buyers business, to all books,
records, files, documents and  correspondence included among the Assets that
relate to the conduct of the U.S. Display  Business prior to the Effective
Time of Closing. From and after the Closing, Seller will  authorize and
permit Buyer and its representatives to have access during normal business 
hours, upon reasonable notice and for reasonable purposes and in such manner
as will not  unreasonably interfere with the conduct of Sellers business, to
all books, records,  files, documents and correspondence not included among
the Assets that relate to the  conduct of the U.S. Display Business prior to
the Effective Time of Closing. Buyer and  Seller agree to maintain all books
and records, files, documents and other correspondence  related to the U.S.
Display Business prior to the Effective Time of Closing for a period  of five
(5) years from the Effective Time of Closing, during which period each party
shall  have the right to review and copy, at the copying partys expense, any
such books,  papers and records.

 

 9. Section 8.9. _Use of  Excluded Intangibles_. 
 

Buyer agrees that without Sellers consent it will not make any use of any of
the  Excluded Intangibles including, without limitation, the names
"Chesapeake  Corporation" or "Chesapeake Display and Packaging Company," the
wordmarks  "Chesapeake" or "CDandP," the phrase "Resourceful by  Nature" or
the "rolling C" logo, or any variation thereof in any manner; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Buyer may use such names and marks (i) on pre-printed
purchase  orders, checks, and business forms bearing such names or marks on
the Closing Date, for a  commercially reasonable period of time in which to
use or consume such items in the  ordinary course of business after Closing,
and (ii) on work-in-process and finished goods  inventory, building signage,
trucks, trailers and similar uses bearing such names or marks  on the Closing
Date, until December 31, 2002. In addition, Buyer may use the  "Chesapeake
Display and Packaging Company" name in the phrase "CorrFlex  Display and
Packaging, LLC (acquiror of Chesapeake Display and Packaging Company)"  and
equivalent uses for up to 24 months following the Closing Date, with the prior
written  consent of Seller for each such use and the form thereof (such
consent not to be  unreasonably withheld). Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless for any Losses suffered by  Seller that are directly attributable to
Buyers use of the Excluded Intangibles  pursuant to this Section.

 

 10. Section 8.10. _Cinnaminson Facility_. 
   

If Buyer elects to close the facility located in Cinnaminson, New Jersey
(the  "Cinnaminson Facility"), prior to December 31, 2001, and gives Seller
at  least seventy-five (75) days prior written notice of such closure, Seller
shall: (i) pay  all severance costs that arise under Sellers severance
agreements and polices that  are in effect on the Closing Date with respect
to Continuing Employees whose employment is  terminated in connection with
such closure; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer  shall use its good faith
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such costs by  offering
Continuing Employees at the Cinnaminson Facility comparable employment at 
Buyers other facilities where available and practical; and (ii) assume the
lease for  the Cinnaminson Facility (and the lease for any leased or licensed
Assets or Equipment  used in the conduct of the U.S. Display Business at such
facility as of the Effective Date  of Closing) from and after the closure
date. Notwithstanding closure of the Cinnaminson  Facility pursuant to this
_Section 8.10_ , Assets (other than leased or licensed  Assets or Equipment
used in the conduct of the U.S. Display Business at such facility as  of the
Effective Date of Closing) at the Cinnaminson Facility shall be the property
of  Buyer after such closure. Buyer shall remove all such Assets (other than
leased or  licensed Assets or Equipment used in the conduct of the U.S.
Display Business at such  facility as of the Effective Date of Closing) from
the Cinnaminson Facility within 60 days  of such closure.

3\. Recommendations Regarding Sprinklers at Erlanger

  **

At the time that Chesapeake acquired the Erlanger plant in 1996, our insurers,
IRI,  judged the buildings sprinkler system to be adequate. In 1998,
however, an IRI Loss  Prevention Survey report indicated that the sprinkler
system was of unacceptable design  for the storage configuration. The area at
issue was the racked warehousing in the north  end of the plant, which had
previously been used for incidental storage.

 

Estimates for upgrading the sprinkler system range from $100,000 to $300,000.

 

During the renewal of property coverage for the 6/01/00 to 6/01/01 term, IRI
required  an additional facultative premium of $42,000 for the Erlanger
sprinkler system issue.

 



                     **

Exhibit 1.58

 

Special Accounting Principles

  **          **

I. Financial Statements.**    

1\. "Obsolete inventory" shall be defined as "inventory that is no longer 
required for manufacture of products or is no longer salable at regular prices
determined  on a basis consistent with current practices."

 

2\. The Financial Statements shall be unaudited.

 

3\. The Financial Statements shall be condensed.

 

4\. The Financial Statements shall include income statements for the fiscal
years ended  December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000, and a balance sheet as of
December 31, 2000.

 

5\. The Financial Statements shall exclude balance sheets as of December 31,
1998, and  1999, and statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999, and  2000, and shall have no notes to the Financial
Statements.

 

6\. Inventory valuation method:

         

       

 * Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined by a standard cost system.  All standard costs for 2001 were updated on December 31, 2000. Standard costs are analyzed  quarterly for any changes in actual costs and are updated accordingly. Work center costing  rates were calculated based on 2001 budgeted activity levels and costs. Based on projected  utilization for 2001, each work centers total costs were broken down into hourly  cost rates for labor and overhead.
 

 * Standard costs for roll stock were based on December 2000 actual purchase prices. Other  material costs were based on a review and comparison to the last purchase order cost for  each item.
 

 * Manufactured or assembled standard item costs are the sum of the required materials per  the bill of materials multiplied by their respective 2001 material cost standard plus the  work center time to produce (as determined by the routing for each item) multiplied by the  2001 work center rate per hour.
 

 * All inventory is valued on a standard cost basis approximating average-cost except roll  stock, which is valued on a LIFO basis.
       

      **

II. Interim Financial Statements.**    

1\. "Obsolete inventory" shall be defined as "inventory that is no longer 
required for manufacture of products or is no longer salable at regular prices
determined  on a basis consistent with current practices."

 

2\. The Interim Financial Statements shall be unaudited.

 

3\. The Interim Financial Statements shall be condensed.

 

4\. The Interim Financial Statements shall include an income statement for the
fiscal  quarter ended April 1, 2001, and a balance sheet as of such date, and
shall exclude any  income statements or balance sheets for any other periods
or dates, any statements of cash  flows and any notes to the Interim
Financial Statements.

 

5\. Inventory valuation method:

         

       

 * Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined by a standard cost system.  All standard costs for 2001 were updated on December 31, 2000. Standard costs are analyzed  quarterly for any changes in actual costs and are updated accordingly. Work center costing  rates were calculated based on 2001 budgeted activity levels and costs. Based on projected  utilization for 2001, each work centers total costs were broken down into hourly  cost rates for labor and overhead.
 

 * Standard costs for roll stock were based on December 2000 actual purchase prices. Other  material costs were based on a review and comparison to the last purchase order cost for  each item.
 

 * Manufactured or assembled standard item costs are the sum of the required materials per  the bill of materials multiplied by their respective 2001 material cost standard plus the  work center time to produce (as determined by the routing for each item) multiplied by the  2001 work center rate per hour.
 

 * All inventory is valued on a standard cost basis approximating average-cost except roll  stock which is valued on a LIFO basis.

practice as set forth in the Notes to the Initial Statement of Adjusted
Working Capital.

 

6\. Rebates receivable pursuant to _Section 2.6_ of the Agreement shall be

7\. Inventory valuation methods:
