its Subsidiaries shall retain their respective right, title and interest in
and to, and Purchaser shall have no rights with respect to the right, title
and interest of Seller and its Subsidiaries in and to, the following assets
(such assets, the " **Excluded Assets** "):

  



  

(i) all the business, properties, assets, goodwill and rights of whatever

Agreement, which Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall be negotiated in good
faith between Seller and Purchaser, but in all events shall be consistent
with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Subject to Sections 5.03 and 5.10, Seller shall have the right to retain,

SECTION 2.02. _Assumption of Assumed Liabilities; Retention of Retained
Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) As of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (or shall cause one
or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries designated by Purchaser not less

Disclosure Schedule_.

  



  

(b) Seller or the relevant Subsidiary shall retain, and shall be fully

Liabilities** "), including the following:

  



  

(i) any Liability arising out of or relating to the Excluded Assets;

  



  

(ii) any of Sellers Liabilities for expenses and fees incident to or arising

by _Section 7.01_);

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) any Liability related to any Employee (including, but not limited to,

(vi) any Liability in respect of indebtedness of the Seller, except for trade

(viii) any of Sellers liabilities or obligations which Purchaser may become
liable for as a result of or in connection with the failure by Purchaser or
Seller to comply with any bulk sales or bulk transfers laws or as a result of
any "de facto merger" or "successor-in-interest" theories of liability, to
the extent that any such noncompliance results in Purchaser assuming any
Liability not set forth in Section 2.02(a); and

  



  

(ix) any of Sellers Liabilities not otherwise referred to in this Section
2.02(b) relating to any legal action, proceeding, claim or investigation
arising out of or in connection with Sellers or any of its Subsidiarys
conduct of the Business prior to the Closing Date, any other conduct of
Seller, Sellers officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents or
advisors in each case other than Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

For purposes of this _Section 2.02(b)_, "Seller" shall be deemed to include
all Affiliates and Subsidiaries of Seller and any predecessors to Seller and
any Person with respect to which Seller is a successor-in-interest (including
by operation of law, merger, liquidation, consolidation, assignment,
assumption or otherwise). Seller hereby acknowledges that it is retaining
the Retained Liabilities.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in consideration
of the transfer of Assets under _Section 2.01_, Purchaser on its own behalf
and, as applicable, as agent for its designated Subsidiaries, shall (i)
assume and become obligated to pay, perform and discharge the Assumed
Liabilities and (ii) pay to Seller an amount of cash (the " **Purchase Price**
") equal to U.S.$230,000,000 (the " **Base Purchase Price** "), as adjusted
in accordance with _Sections 2.03(c)_ and _2.04(b)_.

  



  

(b) For purposes of determining the amount of cash to be paid as the
Estimated Purchase Price by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.07_, Seller shall prepare and deliver, not less than five
Business Days before the Closing Date, a good faith estimate of the Working
Capital as of the Closing Date (such estimated amount, the " **Estimated
Working Capital** "), which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser.

  



  

(c) As used in this Agreement, the " **Estimated Purchase Price** " shall mean
an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price _plus_ an amount equal to
the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (which may be positive or negative).

  



  

(d) The Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among
the Assets in accordance with their fair market values as mutually determined
by Purchaser and Seller (the " **Allocation Schedule** ") for all Tax
purposes, including for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. Seller and Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree on a final Allocation Schedule within 30 days
after the final Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities have been
finalized pursuant to Section 2.04. The procedures set forth in
_Sections 2.04(c), (d) and (e)_, including the use of an Accounting
Arbitrator, shall govern any dispute and the resolution thereof with respect
to the final Allocation Schedule. Any subsequent allocation necessary as a
result of an adjustment to the consideration to be paid hereunder shall be
determined by Seller and Purchaser in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule. For all Tax purposes, Purchaser and Seller agree (i) to report, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to report, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in a manner consistent in all respects with the final
Allocation Schedule, which shall be binding upon Purchaser and Seller and
their respective Subsidiaries and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent
therewith in any Tax Return, Tax filing (including filings required under
Section 1060 of the Code), audit, refund claim or otherwise.

  



  

SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted after the Closing in accordance with
this _Section 2.04_ based upon the Working Capital as of the Closing Date
(the " **Final** **Working Capital** "). For purposes hereof, the statement of
the Final Working Capital, together with the calculation of the Purchase
Price pursuant to this _Section 2.04_, shall be referred to as the "
**Closing Statement**."

  



  

(b) If (i) the Purchase Price Adjustment as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 2.04_ is greater than zero, Purchaser shall pay to Seller
the Purchase Price

  



        
   

  



  

Adjustment or (ii) the Purchase Price Adjustment as finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.04_ is less than zero, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the Purchase Price Adjustment, in either case by wire transfer,
within three Business Days after the final determination of the Purchase
Price, of immediately available U.S. Dollar funds to an account designated by
the party receiving payment, plus interest on such amount accrued from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment at the prime rate applicable from
time to time as announced by Citibank, N.A.

  



  

(c) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within 75 days after the
Closing), Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller the Closing Statement
prepared in accordance with this _Section 2.04_. If Seller disagrees with the
determination of the Closing Statement, Seller shall notify Purchaser of such
disagreement within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement (such
notice, the " **Disagreement Notice** "). The Disagreement Notice shall set
forth, in reasonable detail, any disagreement with, and any requested
adjustment to, the Closing Statement. Matters as to which Seller may submit
disagreements (and the Disagreement Notice) shall be limited to whether the
Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser was calculated in accordance with US
GAAP and prepared on the basis of, and using the same accounting principles,
methodologies and policies reflected in, _Exhibit I_, and Seller shall not
be entitled to submit disagreements on any other basis (including as to
whether such principles, methodologies and policies are or were appropriate).
If Seller fails to deliver the Disagreement Notice by the end of such 30-day
period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement
delivered by Purchaser.  Matters included in the calculations in the Closing
Statement to which Seller does not object in the Disagreement Notice shall be
deemed accepted by Seller and shall not be subject to further dispute or
review. During the period prior to Sellers delivery of any Disagreement
Notice, Seller shall have reasonable access to all documents, schedules and
workpapers used by Purchaser in the preparation of the Closing Statement.
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement with respect to the Closing Statement, and any resolution agreed
to in writing by Purchaser and Seller shall be final and binding upon the
parties.

  



  

(d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by paragraph (c) of this _Section 2.04_ within 30 days after
delivery of a Disagreement Notice by Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall
jointly select a partner at a mutually agreeable accounting firm to resolve
such disagreement.  If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach agreement on
the identity of such a partner within 20 days after the expiration of such
30-day period, either party may request that a partner at a nationally
recognized accounting firm be appointed by the American Arbitration
Association. The individual so selected shall be referred to herein as the "
**Accounting Arbitrator**." The Accounting Arbitrator shall determine, based
solely on the provisions of this Agreement and the presentations by Purchaser
and Seller and their respective representatives, and not by independent
review, the appropriate amount, inclusion or omission of the items and
amounts set forth in the Closing Statement as to which Purchaser and
Seller have not resolved a disagreement identified in the Disagreement Notice
(and only such matters). In resolving any such disputed item, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. Purchaser and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver
to the parties, as promptly as practicable (and in no event

  



        
   

  



  

later than 30 days after his or her appointment), a written report setting
forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
parties. In the event the Accounting Arbitrator concludes that Seller was
correct as to a majority (by dollar amount) of the disputed items, then
Purchaser shall pay the Accounting Arbitrators fees, costs and expenses. In
the event the Accounting Arbitrator concludes that Purchaser was correct as
to a majority (by dollar amount) of the disputed items, then Seller shall pay
the Accounting Arbitrators fees, costs and expenses.

  



  

(e) Purchaser and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this
_Section 2.04_ shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the allocation
referred to in _Section 2.03(d)_.

  



  

SECTION 2.05. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Assets and the assumption of
the Assumed Liabilities, all as contemplated hereby, shall take place at a
closing (the " **Closing** ") to be held at 11:00 AM, Eastern time, on the
first Business Day that is (a) two Business Days following the satisfaction
or waiver of all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties set
forth in _Article VIII_ (other than conditions to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the waiver or fulfillment of those conditions) or (b)
the date that is mutually agreed upon in writing by Seller and Purchaser (the
day on which the Closing takes place being the " **Closing Date** "), at
such place as Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing.

  



  

SECTION 2.06. _Closing Deliveries by Seller_. At the Closing, Seller shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser:

  



  

(a) a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, executed by each of
Seller and its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, to the extent not
delivered prior to the Closing;

  



  

(b) a non-foreign affidavit dated as of the Closing Date and in the form and
substance required under the Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section
1445(b) of the Code so that Purchaser is not obligated to withhold any
portion of the Purchase Price thereunder; and

  



  

(c) any other documents required pursuant to this Agreement or reasonably
requested by Purchaser.

  



  

SECTION 2.07. _Closing Deliveries by Purchaser_. At the Closing, Purchaser
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller:

  



  

(a) a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, executed by each of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, to the extent not
delivered prior to the Closing;

  



  

(b) the Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, to an account or accounts designated at least two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date by Seller in a written notice to Purchaser; and

  



        
   

  



  

(c) any other documents required pursuant to this Agreement or reasonably
requested by Seller.

  



  

SECTION 2.08. _Accounting_. To the extent that, after the Closing Date, (a)
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries receives any payment or instrument that
is for the account of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries according to the
terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly deliver such amount or
instrument to Seller, and (b) Seller or any of its Subsidiaries receives any
payment or instrument that is for the account of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries according to the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall promptly
deliver such amount or instrument to Purchaser.

  



  

SECTION 2.09. _Nonassignable Assets_.

  



  

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
or transfer any Asset (including any Assumed Contract or Shared Contract) to
Purchaser which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable without a Consent (a
" **Nonassignable Asset** "), unless and until such Consent shall have
been obtained. Seller shall advise Purchaser in writing at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing (a) of any Material Contract with a
Material Customer that in the most recent fiscal year of Seller resulted in,
or is required by its terms in the future to result in, the payment or
receipt by the Business of more than $100,000 per annum in the
aggregate with respect to which a Consent of the counterparty is required for
assignment and (b) if, to the Knowledge of any of the individuals listed in
Part 1 of _Section 1.01(a)(iv) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, Seller
has received written notice by letter, facsimile or email that such Material
Customer will not agree to the assignment of any Material Contract described
in clause (a) to Purchaser hereunder at the Closing. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law and by the terms of the applicable Nonassignable Asset,
such Nonassignable Asset shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by
Seller (or the relevant Subsidiary of Seller) for the benefit and burden of
Purchaser and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be fully
performed by Purchaser on Sellers (or such Subsidiarys) behalf and all
rights and Liabilities existing thereunder shall be for Purchasers account.
 For the avoidance of doubt, the designation of an Asset as a Nonassignable
Asset does not render it an Excluded Asset.

  



  

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and by the terms of the
applicable Nonassignable Asset, Seller and Purchaser shall take, or cause to
be taken, such actions as the other party may reasonably request that are
required to be taken or appropriate in order to provide Purchaser with the
benefits and burdens of the Nonassignable Assets. Seller shall promptly pay
over to Purchaser the net amount (after de minimis reasonable administrative
expenses and an adjustment for Taxes placing each party as nearly as possible
in the same position as if the Nonassignable Asset had been transferred to
Purchaser on the Closing Date), of all payments received by it (or such
Subsidiary) in respect of all Nonassignable Assets and Purchaser shall
indemnify Seller (or such Subsidiary) for all Losses attributable to Sellers
(or such Subsidiarys) holding of all Nonassignable Assets.

  



  

(c) Nothing in this _Section 2.09_ shall require Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to renew any Nonassignable Asset that is an Assumed Contract or
a Shared Contract. In addition, Seller (or the applicable Subsidiary of
Seller) shall have the right, any time after the

  



        
   

  



  

six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, upon no less than 10 Business
Days advance written notice to Purchaser, to exercise any right to terminate
any Nonassignable Asset that is an Assumed Contract or a Shared Contract.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

  



  

For purposes of the representations and warranties of Seller
contained herein, other than Section 3.05, disclosure in any section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule of any facts or circumstances shall be deemed to
be adequate response and disclosure of such facts or circumstances with
respect to all representations or warranties by Seller calling for disclosure
of such information, whether or not such disclosure is specifically
associated with or purports to respond to one or more of such representations
or warranties, to the extent a matter is disclosed in such a way as to make
its relevance to such other representation or warranty readily apparent. The
inclusion of any information in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or other document delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall not be
deemed to be an admission or evidence of the materiality of such item, nor
shall it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

  



  

Except (a) as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (b) as disclosed
in, or as readily apparent from, the face of the Financial Information, or
(c) to the extent relating solely to the Excluded Assets or the Retained
Liabilities, Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows.

  



  

SECTION 3.01. _Organization and Good Standing_. Seller, and each of its

its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Seller and each such Subsidiary is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned
or leased by it or the operation of its business makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect or a materially adverse effect upon Sellers or such
Subsidiaries ability to carry out its obligations under, and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

  



  

SECTION 3.02. _Authority_. Seller, and each of its Subsidiaries that is or
will be a party thereto, has full power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be
a signatory and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution, delivery and performance by Seller and each such Subsidiary of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is or will be a
signatory has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the
part of Seller and each such Subsidiary, and no other proceedings on the part
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement. This Agreement has been,
and upon execution of each Ancillary Agreement each such Ancillary Agreement
will be, duly executed and delivered by Seller and each such Subsidiary that
is or will be a party thereto

  



         
 

  



  

and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser and, if
applicable in the case of the Ancillary Agreements, by each Subsidiary of
Purchaser that is or will be a party thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and
each Ancillary Agreement to which Seller or any such Subsidiary is or will be
a party constitutes or, when so executed and delivered, will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller and each such Subsidiary,
enforceable against Seller and each such Subsidiary in accordance with its
terms, subject only to the effect, if any, of (a) applicable bankruptcy and
other similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and (b) Laws
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

  



  

SECTION 3.03. _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_. Subject to the filing by
Seller of reports under the Exchange Act and as contemplated by the rules of
Nasdaq and to the requirements of the HSR Act and any filings or applications
required under the Laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction, including the European
Union or any nation thereof, (a) the execution and delivery by Seller or, if
applicable in the case of the Ancillary Agreements, any of its Subsidiaries,
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a
party, (b) the consummation by Seller or any such Subsidiary of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (c) the compliance by Seller
or any such Subsidiary with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, do not
and will not:

  



  

(i) conflict with, or result in the breach of, any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents of
Seller or any such Subsidiary;

  



  

(ii) require Seller or any such Subsidiary to make any filing with, or obtain
any Consent;

  



  

(iii) conflict with, violate or result in the breach by Seller or any such
Subsidiary of any applicable Law;

  



  

(iv) after the giving of notice, or the lapse of time or otherwise, conflict
with, violate, result in the breach or termination of or constitute a default
under, or give any party the right to terminate, amend, modify, abandon,
cancel or refuse to perform under, or accelerate or modify the time within
which or the terms under which any duties or obligations are to be performed
by the Seller or any rights or benefits are to be received by any Person
under, any Assumed Contract or Shared Contract (except Nonassignable Assets);
or

  



  

(v) result in the creation of any Lien (other than any Permitted Lien or any
Lien created by or through Purchaser) upon any of the Assets;

  



  

except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for such matters
that individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect or a material adverse effect upon Sellers or any such Subsidiarys
ability to carry out its respective obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 3.04. _Financial Information_.

  



  

(a) Seller has provided Purchaser with the audited adjusted financial
information relating to the Business set forth in Part I of _Section 3.04 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (the " **Audited Financial Information** ").

SECTION 4.06. _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser has delivered to Seller a true and complete copy of an executed
commitment letter dated February 20, 2009 (as the same may be amended and
replaced in accordance with _Section 5.14_, the "Debt Commitment
Letter"), pursuant to which the lender parties thereto have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth
therein for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " **Debt** Financing").

  



  

(b) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or
modified in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so
delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Purchaser under any term or condition of the
Debt Commitment Letter.  As of the date of this Agreement, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Section 8.01_ and _Section
8.03_ (other than the condition set forth in Section 8.03(d)), Purchaser has
no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees that
have been incurred and are due and payable as of the date of this Agreement
in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

(c) As of the date hereof, Purchaser has no contracts, agreements,
commitments, arrangements or understandings with any Person concerning any
equity or debt contributions to be made to Purchaser to all or any part of
the Purchase Price other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or
those that would not materially and adversely affect Purchasers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, nor any contracts, agreements,
commitments, arrangements or understandings with any Person concerning the
ownership and operation of Purchaser or the Business other than those that
would not adversely affect Purchasers ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 4.07. _Brokers_. Except for fees and commissions that will be paid by
Purchaser, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or similar fee or commission in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

individuals listed on _Exhibit J_. Purchaser shall be deemed to have
consented to such action unless Purchaser notifies the Seller in writing by
11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the fifth Business Day following delivery of all
notices required in the preceding sentence that Purchaser does not consent to
such action.

  



  

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Advice of Changes_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
(i) give Purchaser, its authorized representatives, and its lenders, upon
reasonable advance notice and during regular business hours, reasonable
access to all books, records, personnel, officers and other facilities and
properties of the Business, (ii) permit Purchaser to make such copies and
inspections thereof, upon reasonable advance notice and during regular
business hours, as Purchaser may reasonably request and (iii) provide
Purchaser with access to information regarding any discussions with customers
of the Business regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any customer Consents as Purchaser may reasonably request, (iv) cause the
officers of Seller and its Subsidiaries to furnish Purchaser with such
unaudited financial and operating data and other information with respect to
the Business as is regularly prepared in the ordinary course that Purchaser
may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such access shall be conducted in accordance with Law (including any
applicable antitrust or competition law), at a reasonable time, under the
supervision of Sellers personnel and in such a manner as to maintain
confidentiality and not to interfere with the normal operations of the
businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other agreement between
Purchaser and Seller executed on or prior to the date hereof, Seller shall
not have any obligation to make available to Purchaser or its
representatives, or provide Purchaser or its representatives with, (i) any
Tax Return filed by Seller or any of its Affiliates or predecessors, or any
related material, except to the extent relating solely to the Assets, or (ii)
any information if making such information available would (A) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or (B) contravene any applicable Law
or agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or any
its Affiliates is a party), so long as the Seller has taken all commercially
reasonable steps (including requests for waivers) to enable otherwise
required disclosure to Purchaser to occur without so jeopardizing privilege
or

  



        
   

  



  

contravening such Law, duty or agreement. If any material is withheld by
such party pursuant to the preceding sentence, Seller shall inform the
Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being withheld.

  



  

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party of the failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement of which it
becomes aware and which would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the obligations of the other party to effect the transactions
provided for in this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.02(c) (i)
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter at or prior to the execution of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice and (ii) shall not be given any effect for the purpose
of (x) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties
made by the party providing such notice or (y) determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ has been satisfied.

  



  

SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

  



  

(a) The terms of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of January
18, 2008, between Seller and Purchaser (the " **Confidentiality Agreement**
") are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full
force and effect and survive the Closing, except that (1) the non-disclosure
and non-use obligations of Purchaser under sections 1(i) and 1(ii) of the
Confidentiality Agreement in respect of information about the Business shall
terminate at the Closing and (2) solely with respect to Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) that relates exclusively to the
Business, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed the Receiving Party (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) from and after Closing. If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in all respects and section 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
apply with respect to the Employees.

  



  

(b) Neither of the parties shall issue any press release or make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of (i) Seller, in the
event the disclosing party is Purchaser, or (ii) Purchaser, in the event
the disclosing party is the Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except each party may make such disclosure to the extent
so required pursuant to an applicable requirement of Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange,
provided that each party shall give the other a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon such disclosure to the extent practicable.

  



  

SECTION 5.04. _Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closing to Occur_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,

forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.03 _to be

  



        
   

  



  

satisfied, and the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause the conditions
set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ to be satisfied.  Without
limiting the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser shall (i)  prepare and file all

filing and application fees to Governmental Authorities, all of which shall
be paid or reimbursed by Purchaser) in order to obtain any Consent, (ii)
defend all lawsuits and other proceedings by or before any Governmental
Authority challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Closing and
(iii) cause to be lifted or rescinded any injunction, decree, ruling, order

limitation of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and Seller agrees to make or
cause to be made an appropriate filing of any Notification and Report Form
required pursuant to the HSR Act and any filings or applications required
under the Laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction, including the European Union or
any nation thereof, as soon as practicable after the date hereof. In
addition, no party hereto shall take any action after the date hereof that
could reasonably be expected to delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any Consent from any Governmental Authority or other Person
required to be obtained prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser and Seller shall not be required to take any commercially
unreasonable action that substantially impairs the overall benefits realized
from the consummation of the transactions set forth herein, and in no event
shall Purchaser be required to (i) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose
of the Assets or Purchasers or its Affiliates other assets or businesses
now owned or hereafter acquired by Purchaser to resolve any objection or
proceeding objecting to the transactions contemplated hereunder or (ii)
terminate any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations.

  



  

(b) If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

  



  

(c) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the requisite Consents of
each applicable Governmental Authority, including:

  



  

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings under the HSR Act,
other antitrust or trade regulation Laws of any jurisdiction, and any Laws
regulating foreign investment of any jurisdiction in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) furnishing to the other party all information within its possession that
is required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to the HSR Act, other competition Laws of any jurisdiction, or any
Laws

  



        
   

  



  

regulating foreign investment of any jurisdiction in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  



  

(iv) not agreeing to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in connection with proceedings under or relating to
the HSR Act, other competition Laws of any jurisdiction, or Laws regulating
foreign investment of any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless it consults with the other party in
advance, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and

  



  

(v) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act, competition
Laws of any jurisdiction, or Laws regulating foreign investment of any
jurisdiction, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(d) The Seller shall, at Purchasers expense, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining the title commitments and surveys
with respect to the Owned Real Property, including, without limitation,
removing from title any Liens which are not Permitted Liens.  The Seller
shall provide the title company with a customary owners affidavit and gap
indemnity reasonably requested by the title company in connection with
issuance of the title policies with respect to the Owned Real Property.

  



  

SECTION 5.05. _Bulk Sales_. Without limitation of Sellers (or its relevant
Subsidiarys) obligations set forth in _Section 2.02(b)(viii)_, Purchaser
hereby waives compliance by Seller and its Subsidiaries with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
sale of the Business and the Assets to Purchaser.

the parties shall execute and deliver such documents and other papers and
take such further actions as may reasonably be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the execution and
delivery of such assignments, deeds and other documents as may be necessary
to transfer any Assets as provided in this Agreement.  Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the Closing (a) Seller shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) do all things necessary,

  



        
   

  



  

proper or advisable as reasonably requested by Purchaser to put Purchaser in
effective possession, ownership and control of the Assets, and Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller for such purpose, including obtaining consents
from any third parties to the extent necessary to transfer any Assumed
Contract to the Purchaser (or its designated Affiliates) and (b) Purchaser
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) do all things necessary, proper
or advisable as reasonably requested by Seller (i) to transfer to Seller (or
such other Person as Seller shall indicate) any Excluded Assets that
Purchaser may possess and (ii) to assure that Purchaser, rather than Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries, is the obligor in respect of all Assumed
Liabilities, including by novating any Assumed Contract that is
a Nonassignable Asset to Purchaser and seeking to cause the counterparty to
any Shared Contract to enter into a new agreement with Purchaser with respect
to the matters addressed by such Shared Contract, and Seller shall cooperate
with Purchaser for such purposes, provided that neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall be obligated to make any payment or deliver anything of value to any
third party (other than filing and application fees to Governmental
Authorities, all of which shall be paid or reimbursed by Purchaser) in order
to obtain any Consent to the transfer of Assets or the assumption of
Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser shall, upon the request of Seller, and at no
cost to Seller (other than reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses), make the
Transferred Employees available at reasonable times and cooperate in all
reasonable respects with Seller and its Subsidiaries in the preparation for,
and defense of, any lawsuit, arbitration or other Action (whether disclosed
or not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule) filed or claimed against
Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of the respective agents, directors,
officers and employees of Seller and its Affiliates, whether currently
pending or asserted in the future, concerning the operation or conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date, except with respect to any Actions
between Seller and Purchaser that may arise as a result of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

SECTION 5.09. _Ancillary Agreements_. On the Closing Date, each of Purchaser
and Seller shall (and, if applicable, each shall cause its Subsidiaries or,
in the case of Purchaser, its wholly owned Subsidiaries to) execute and
deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party if such
Ancillary Agreement has not been executed on the date hereof.

  



  

SECTION 5.10. _Maintenance of Books and Records_. After the Closing Date, each
of the parties hereto shall preserve, until at least the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date, all pre-Closing Date records to the extent relating to the
Business possessed or to be possessed by such party.  After the Closing Date
and up until at least the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, upon any
reasonable request from a party hereto or its representatives, the party
holding such records shall (a) provide to the requesting party or its
representatives reasonable access to such records during normal business
hours and (b) permit the requesting party or its representatives to make
copies of such records, in each case at no cost to the requesting party or
its representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses);
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require either party to
disclose any information to the other if such disclosure would jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene any applicable Law,
fiduciary duty or agreement (it being understood that each party shall
cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would
enable otherwise required disclosure to the other party to occur without so
jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Law, duty or agreement) or
require either party to disclose its Tax records. Such records may be sought
under this _Section 5.10_ for any reasonable purpose, including to the
extent reasonably required in connection with accounting, litigation, federal
securities disclosure or other similar

  



        
   

  



  

needs of the party seeking such records (other than claims between Seller and
Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any and all such
records may be destroyed by a party if such destroying party sends to the
other party hereto written notice of its intent to destroy such
records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to be
destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the 60th day following
such notice unless the other party hereto notifies the destroying party that
such other party desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event
the destroying party shall transfer the records to such requesting party and
such requesting party shall pay all reasonable expenses of the destroying
party in connection therewith and (ii) no party shall be required to provide
the other party access to, or copies of, any Tax Returns, except to the
extent relating solely to the Assets.

  



  

SECTION 5.11. ** **_Deletion of Non-Transferred Software_.  Purchaser agrees
that, on and following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not use and shall
cause each of its Affiliates not to use any software or computer databases
loaded on the Equipment included in the Assets as of the Closing Date, unless
such licenses to software or computer databases are included in the Assets or
Purchaser otherwise has the right to use them pursuant to the Intellectual
Property License Agreement or Transition Services Agreement or otherwise.
Purchaser shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any event no
later than 45 days following the Closing Date, delete all such software and
computer databases from any of the Equipment on which it is installed.

  



  

SECTION 5.12. _Use of Seller s Trademarks and Logos_. Except as expressly
provided in the Intellectual Property License Agreement, Purchaser shall not
have the right to use, and shall promptly cease and desist from all use of,
the name "VeriSign" or any trade names, trademarks, identifying logos or
service marks owned by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than as part
of the Transferred Intellectual Property) or employing the word "VeriSign" or
any part or variation of any of the foregoing or any confusingly similar
trade names, trademarks or logos to any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
**Seller s Trademarks and Logos**") and will adopt new trade names,
trademarks, identifying logos and service marks related thereto which are not
confusingly similar to Sellers Trademarks and Logos.  Without prejudice to
Purchasers obligation to cease and desist from the use of Sellers
Trademarks and Logos, Purchaser shall not use Sellers Trademarks and Logos
in any manner that might dilute, tarnish, disparage or reflect adversely on
Seller or Sellers Trademarks and Logos or result in any Liability to Seller.

  



  

SECTION 5.13. _Seller Guarantees and Other Credit Support of the Business_.
Following the Closing, but subject to any obligation of Seller or its
relevant Subsidiary under _Section 2.02(b)_, Purchaser will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to procure the release by the applicable
counterparty, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than 60
days after the Closing Date, of any continuing obligation of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any Assumed Contract or Shared Contract
(including any guarantee or credit support provided by, or any letter of
credit posted by, Seller or any such Subsidiary) and will indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries from and against any Loss resulting from
or relating to any such obligation. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, following the Closing, Purchaser will (a) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to procure the release by the applicable counterparty of
any continuing obligation of Seller or any such Subsidiary with respect to
the guarantees or other credit support set forth in _Section 5.13 of the
Seller Disclosure _

  



        
   

  



  

 _Schedule_ and (b) indemnify and hold harmless Seller and each such
Subsidiary from and against any Loss resulting from or relating to any
continuing obligation of Seller or any such Subsidiary with respect to any
such guarantee or other credit support.

  



  

SECTION 5.14. _Consummation of Debt Financing._

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things that in its
good faith determination are necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter and negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
reflected in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Purchaser in such Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements, as applicable, that are within their control and (iii)
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing; provided that in no
event shall Purchaser be required to pay any amounts not specified in the
Debt Commitment Letter or commence litigation or any arbitral or other
adversary proceedings against any Person obligated to arrange or provide any
portion of the Debt Financing. In furtherance of the provisions of this
_Section 5.14_, the Debt Commitment Letter may be amended or superseded to
replace or add one or more lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof, or otherwise in a manner not less beneficial to
Purchaser (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser) (the "
**New Debt Financing Commitments** "),  _provided_ that the New Debt
Financing Commitments shall not (i) expand or adversely amend, in any
material respect, the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter; (ii) reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
Closing; or (iii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless,
in the case of this clause (iii), replaced with an equal or greater amount of
new equity or other financing that satisfies the conditions set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii)). Upon and from and after each such event, the term "
**Debt Financing** " as used in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to
mean the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter that is
not so amended or superseded at the time in question and the New Debt
Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. In the event any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter for any reason, Purchaser shall,
subject to any limitations set forth in the existing Debt Commitment Letter,
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources ("Alternative Financing") as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event on terms that are not less favorable,
in the aggregate, to Purchaser than as contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter. Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably apprised as to the status of,
and any material developments relating to, the Debt Financing.

  



  

(b) Purchaser will pay when due all commitment fees arising under the Debt
Commitment Letter as and when they become payable.

  



  

(c) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and representatives,
officers, directors, employees and advisors (including legal and accounting)
to, provide to Purchaser all cooperation, on a timely basis, as reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with

  



         
 

  



  

the Debt Financing ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries), including: (i) upon reasonable notice, permitting key
employees of the Business to participate in meetings, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions, management presentation sessions, " _road shows_ " and
sessions with rating agencies, (ii) subject to execution by such lenders of
customary confidentiality agreements, providing to the lenders specified in
the Debt Commitment Letter such financial and other information in Sellers
possession relating to the Business as they may reasonably request, making
the key employees of the Business available to assist the lenders specified
in the Debt Commitment Letter with the preparation of materials (including
business projections, pro forma financial information and similar materials)
for rating agency, lender and investor presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information and syndication memoranda,
prospectuses, marketing materials and similar documents in connection with
the Debt Financing; (iii) assisting in obtaining auditors reports in respect
of audited financials (including consents of accountants for use of their
reposts in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) as reasonably
requested by Purchaser; (iv) executing or obtaining and delivering at the
Closing other customary certificates, consents, opinions, survey and title
insurance and other documents as may be reasonably requested by the relevant
financing sources; and (v) otherwise reasonably cooperating in connection
with the consummation of the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is
not simultaneously reimbursed by Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing. Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives for and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (including information provided by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries).  Purchaser shall not be obligated to reimburse
Seller for the time of Sellers employees required to comply with Sellers
obligations under this Section 5.14(e).

  



  

SECTION 5.15. _Financial Information_.

  



  

(a) (i)  Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, within sixty (60) days
after the end of each of the first three calendar quarters or ninety (90)
days after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, Seller shall provide
Purchaser an unaudited balance sheet and related income statement for the
Business as of the end of, and for the period of, such quarter (collectively,
the " **Interim Financial Statements** ") and (ii) as promptly as practical
but in no event more than 45 days following the Closing, furnish Purchaser and
its Debt Financing sources with audited adjusted financial statements
relating to the Business as of and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008
in a manner meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act, together with a report thereon by KPMG LLP (the " **SEC
Financial Statements** "). The Interim Financial Statements shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Unaudited Financial Information.
In connection with the foregoing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts
to execute such management and other representation letters as shall be
reasonably requested by KPMG, LLP to complete the audit of the SEC Financial
Statements.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Promptly following the Closing Date, Seller shall (i) at its own expense,
prepare balance sheets and related statements of income and cash flows of the
Business, together with all footnotes and schedules required by US GAAP, for
the three months ending March 31, 2009 (the " _2009 Unaudited Financial
Statements_ "), which shall be prepared (x) using substantially the same
basis of presentation as the Interim Financial Statements, (y) in a manner
meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X adopted under the Securities Act;
and (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions necessary, proper
or advisable to assist KPMG LLP in the completion of a review, consistent
with the requirements of SAS 100, of the 2009 Unaudited Financial Statements,
including executing such management and other representation letters as shall
be reasonably requested by KPMG LLP. The parties shall consult with one
another, and reasonably discuss and agree (in light of the actual date of the
Closing and the intent of preparing financial statements meeting the
requirements of Regulation S-X adopted under the Securities Act), on whether
(x) any modifications to the periods covered by the 2009 Unaudited Financial
Statements are necessary, desirable or appropriate (including, where
possible, a change of the periods for which financial statements must be
prepared by Seller), and (y) any corresponding changes to the reviews to be
conducted by KPMG LLP are necessary, in each case in order for such financial
statements to be in compliance with Regulation S-X adopted under the
Securities Act. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the 2009
Unaudited Financial Statements to be delivered to Purchaser no more than 45
days after the Closing Date. Seller shall, and shall cause each of
its officers and employees to, provide to KPMG LLP all information, documents
and assistance reasonably requested by KPMG LLP in connection with the review
of the 2009 Unaudited Financial Statements, and shall reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser in the preparation by the Purchaser and its auditors of _pro
forma_ financial information that reflect the effect of the acquisition by
Purchaser of the Business for such periods as would be required by Regulation
S-X under the Securities Act.

  



  

SECTION 5.16. _Exclusivity_.

  



  

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing, and (ii) the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_, except as specifically permitted
in _Section 5.16(b)_, Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, attorneys, advisors, accountants,
bankers, agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i)
initiate or solicit any proposal or offer from any Person (other than
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates) relating to any transaction or series of
related transactions involving:  (A) the disposition or acquisition of all or
any material portion of the Assets or any asset which, if held by Seller as
of the Closing Date would be an Asset (other than (x) in connection with
transactions that are permitted pursuant to this Agreement or (y) in the
ordinary course of business of the Seller) or (B) any other transaction or
financing which if consummated would have a materially adverse effect on
Sellers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms and on the basis and timeframe set
forth herein (each of (A) and (B) above, inclusive, an "
**Alternative Transaction** "); (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations or enter into any letter of intent or agreement (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to the extent permitted under
_Section 5.16(b)_) with, or provide any information to, any Person or any of
such Persons Affiliates, advisors or representatives (other than Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates, advisors or representatives) in connection with an
Alternative Transaction to be made by or on behalf of

  



        
   

  



  

such Person; (iii) accept any proposal or offer from any Person (other than
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates) relating to an Alternative Transaction;
or (iv) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
"standstill" or similar obligation of any Person (other than Purchaser).
Seller agrees that it shall, and shall cause its and the Business officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, attorneys, advisors, accountants, bankers,
agents and representatives to, cease all negotiations with all third parties
(other than Purchaser or its Affiliates) related to an Alternative
Transaction and shall not recommence such negotiations unless this Agreement
is terminated. Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing if any
Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to a
possible Alternative Transaction and shall provide to Purchaser the terms of
any such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact (including without limitation
the name of the Person making the proposal, offer, inquiry or contact), and
in the case of written materials provided to Seller or its advisors or
representatives, copies of all such materials, including financing letters.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.16(a)_, at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, Seller
shall be permitted, if it has otherwise complied with its obligations under
this _Section 5.16_, to

  



  

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with a Person who has made a bona
fide written offer or proposal for an Alternative Transaction not solicited
in violation of this _Section 5.16_ if, prior to taking such action, (x)
Seller enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person
and (y) the board of directors of Seller determines in good faith after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors, that such proposal or offer
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Alternative
Transaction; and

  



  

(ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Seller or
the Business to a Person who has made a bona fide written offer or proposal
for an Alternative Transaction not solicited in violation of this Section
5.16 if, prior to taking such action, the board of directors of Seller
determines in good faith after receiving the advice of its financial
advisors, that such proposal or offer constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Alternative Transaction, but only so long as Seller (x)
has caused such Person to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
and (y) concurrently discloses the same non-public information to the
Purchaser if such non-public information has not previously been disclosed to
the Purchaser.

  



  

(iii) Seller shall keep Purchaser informed on a current basis of the status,
terms and substance of any discussions or negotiations including amendments
and proposed amendments of any such inquiry, proposal or offer, and shall
notify Purchaser promptly if Sellers board of directors determines that an
proposal or offer constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Alternative Transaction. Seller agrees that none of it or
its Subsidiaries shall enter into any confidentiality or other agreement with
any Person after the date hereof which prohibits Seller from complying with
its obligations under this _Section 5.16(b)(iii)_.

  



  

SECTION 5.17. _Non-Solicitation_. Seller agrees that for a period of one (1)
year from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly

  



        
   

  



  

or indirectly, solicit to hire or hire any Transferred Employee, unless such
Person ceased to be an employee of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior to
such action by Seller or its Subsidiaries, or, in the case of such Persons
voluntary termination of employment with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, at
least three months prior to such action by Seller or its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this  _Section
5.17_ shall not apply to bona fide general solicitations of, or
advertisements for, employment placed by Seller that are not
specifically targeted at such Persons. In addition, neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall directly, or indirectly through another Person, for
so long as Seller shall have continuing obligations under _Section
5.18_ below, call on, solicit or service any customer, supplier, licensee,
licensor or other business relation of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
order to induce or attempt to induce such Person to cease doing business with
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Business, or in any
way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier,
licensee or business relation with respect to the Business and Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (including making any negative statements or
communications with respect to the Business about Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates).

  



  

SECTION 5.18. _Noncompetition_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 5.18(b)_ below, in consideration of the
Purchaser entering into this Agreement and in order that the Purchaser may
enjoy the full benefit of the Assets and the Business, for a period of twenty
four (24) months from and after the Closing Date (the "
**Noncompetition Period** "), neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly, carry on, or participate in, a business which
is directly in competition with the Business (any such restricted activity, a
" **Competitive Business** ").

  



  

(b) Nothing in this _Section 5.18_ shall restrict the right of Seller and
its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly:

  



  

(i) continue to operate each of the businesses of Seller other than the
Business (the " **Existing Businesses** ") in substantially the same manner
as the Existing Businesses are currently conducted (including any business
substantially similar to an Existing Business acquired by Seller or any of
its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date to the extent such business is
thereafter conducted in substantially the same manner as the
Existing Businesses are currently conducted);

  



  

(ii) transfer any Existing Business to any third party (including any third
party engaged in a Competitive Business);

  



  

(iii) provide any service or carry out any activity that Seller or its
Subsidiaries will be required to provide or carry out as a result of the
adoption of any consensus policy by the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers;

  



  

(iv) acquire or hold securities of any Person that is engaged in a
Competitive Business, provided that such acquisition or holding of securities
represents a passive investment for Seller or any of its Affiliates and does
not give

  



        
   

  



  

Seller or any of its Affiliates the right to appoint directors or management
of such Person or to otherwise exercise control over the management of such
Person; or

  



  

(v) acquire the majority of the voting securities of any Person, or acquire
the assets of a business, that is engaged in a Competitive Business, provided
that such Competitive Business (A) is terminated or disposed of within twelve
months after completion of such acquisition and (B) represents less than 10%
of the revenues generated by such acquired Person or business.

  



  

(c) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach,
or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.18_ will
be inadequate and, accordingly, the Seller covenants and agrees that
the Purchaser shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which
the Purchaser may have at Law, be entitled to seek equitable relief,
including injunctive relief, and to seek the remedy of specific performance
with respect to any breach or threatened breach of such covenant, as may be
available from any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, the Seller
and the Purchaser agree that the terms of the covenant in this _Section
5.18_ are fair and reasonable in light of the Purchasers plans for the
Assets and the Business and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of
the goodwill and other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event
that any of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.18_ shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions shall not be deemed
void, and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by the
court and that said covenant contained in this _Section 5.18_ shall be
amended in accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed by
the parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced
to the full extent of its terms and conditions or if a court finds the scope
of the covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine the covenant so as
to comply with applicable Law.

  



  

SECTION 5.19. _UCC Termination Statements_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Purchaser UCC-3 termination
statements or similar documents evidencing the termination of all Liens on
the Assets, other than Permitted Liens.

  



  

SECTION 5.20. _Covenant Not to Sue_. For so long as Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries is the counterparty to, or with respect to any services received
by Seller or one of its Subsidiaries under, the Messaging Agreement, (i)
Seller shall not bring a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
6(c)(iii) of the portion of the Messaging Agreement known as the Master
Services Agreement with respect to any claim alleging that one or more of the
Assets infringes the intellectual property rights of any Person as described
in such Section 6(c)(iii), and (ii) Seller shall not (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to) bring a claim against Purchaser alleging that the
provision of services to Seller under the Messaging Agreement violates or
infringes upon any Intellectual Property Right of Seller. For the avoidance
of doubt, this paragraph shall not create any obligation of or with respect
to any assignee of the Messaging Agreement that is not an Affiliate of
Seller.

  



        
   

  



  

ARTICLE VI

  



  

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  



  

SECTION 6.01. _Offers and Terms of Employment_.

  



  

(a) No later than 5 days prior to Closing, Seller shall update _Section
1.01(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ to reflect any change in the
status of Employees, and Purchaser shall update _Section 6.01(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_. Seller shall terminate, effective as of the
Closing Date, the employment of all Employees listed in _Section 6.01(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause one of its applicable Subsidiaries to **** offer
employment to each Employee who is listed in _Section 6.01(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (each such Employee, an " **Offeree** "). Each
Offeree who accepts Purchasers or one of its Subsidiaries offer of
employment shall be referred to herein as a " **Transferred Employee**."

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall cause each offer of employment pursuant to _Section
6.01(a)_ to provide for (i) an annual salary or hourly wage rate (as
applicable), (ii) annual and long-term bonus and incentive compensation
opportunities (other than incentive compensation opportunities related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or equity compensation) and,
(iii) employee benefits (collectively, the " **Employment Terms** ") that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to Employment Terms of, or made
available to, similarly situated employees of the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) During the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date or any
longer period required by applicable Law (such period, the "
**Coverage Period** "), Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, continue to provide each Transferred Employee with the Employment
Terms pursuant to this _Section 6.01_.  Nothing herein shall restrict the
right of Purchaser or a Subsidiary of Purchaser to terminate the employment
of any Transferred Employee, provided any such termination is effected in
accordance with applicable Law and the terms of any applicable Purchaser
Benefit Plan or applicable collective agreement or collective bargaining
agreement.

  



  

(d) If any Transferred Employee requires a visa, work permit or employment
pass or other approval for his employment to commence with, or to transfer to
or continue with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall promptly file any and all necessary applications or
documents and shall take all actions needed to secure the necessary visa,
permit, pass or other approval, and Seller shall provide such assistance as
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection therewith.  Seller agrees
that it will amend its qualified 401(k) plan to provide 100% vesting for all
Transferred Employees.

  



  

(e) Not later than fifteen days after the end of each month during the
Coverage Period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with the information set
forth in _Section 6.01(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ with respect to
(i) each Transferred Employee who receives a payment from Purchaser pursuant
to any Change of Control Agreement, together with information reasonably
requested by Seller regarding the Transferred Employees in furtherance of
this paragraph, and (ii) Seller shall provide Purchaser with the amounts due
to

  



        
   

  



  

any Transferred Employees under the VeriSign Performance Plan.  Promptly
following delivery of the foregoing information, but in no event more than
ten (10) Business Days thereafter, Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser
with respect to amounts paid or to be paid in that monthly period to any such
former Transferred Employee in respect of a Liability assumed by Purchaser
under Section 2.02(a)(vi), by wire transfer of immediately available U.S.
Dollar funds to an account designated by Purchaser.

  



  

(f) _Section 6.02(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list of
Persons who, as of the date hereof, are on a leave of absence from the
Business (each, an " _Absent Employee_ "). Not less than 5 days prior to
Closing, Purchaser shall indicate to Seller the Absent Employees, if any, to
which Purchaser intends to offer employment. Any Absent Employee who receives
such an offer shall be deemed an "Offeree" for the purposes of this
Agreement. In the event that any Absent Employee returns from absence leave
prior to the Closing, such Absent Employee shall automatically be deemed an
"Employee" for the purposes of this Agreement, and upon accepting Purchasers
offer of employment pursuant to this paragraph an Absent Employee shall
automatically be deemed a "Transferred Employee" for purposes of this
Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 6.02. _Assumption of Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume, honor, pay
and perform any and all Liabilities of Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries, to
or in respect of any Transferred Employee for accrued but unpaid vacation
benefits listed in _Section 6.02(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(as such amounts may be adjusted as of the Closing). Effective from and
after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall assume and be
solely responsible for all employment and employee benefits-related
Liabilities that arise on or after the Closing Date and that relate to any
Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of such Transferred
Employee) and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
Liability with respect to any such Transferred Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary of such Transferred Employee) that relates to such Transferred
Employees employment with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, except that
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall retain any Liabilities that arise at any
time under the Seller Benefit Plans.

  



  

(b) Seller agrees that it shall be solely responsible for satisfying the
continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for all
"MandA qualified beneficiaries," as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation 54.4980B-9.

  



  

(c) Except as specifically provided in this _Article VI_, Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall retain and be solely responsible for all employment
Liabilities of Seller to the extent such Liabilities were incurred or arose
at any time prior to the Closing Date that relate to any Employee (including
any Transferred Employee). Seller and its Subsidiaries shall retain and be
solely responsible for all employee benefits related Liabilities of Sellers,
any of its Subsidiaries, any Seller Benefit Plan or any Benefit Plan of an
ERISA Affiliate regardless of when such Liabilities arose or were incurred.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 6.03. ** **[ _Reserved._ ]

  



  

SECTION 6.04. _Participation in Purchaser Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this
_Article VI_, each Transferred Employee shall cease to participate in any
Seller Benefit Plan (other than as a former employee of Seller and its
Subsidiaries to the extent, if any, permitted by the terms of such Seller
Benefit Plan). Effective from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, establish or have in effect
Benefit Plans for the benefit of the Transferred Employees (and
their dependents and beneficiaries) in accordance with the requirements of
this _Article VI_ and Purchasers and its Subsidiaries offers of
employment.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to, recognize the service of the Transferred
Employees prior to the Closing Date with Seller or any of its Affiliates and
any of their respective predecessors as service with Purchaser for the
purposes of eligibility and vesting, and for the purposes of benefit accrual
under vacation and paid time off, under the Purchaser Benefit Plans, except
to the extent the recognition of such service would result in the duplication
of benefits for the same period of service. With respect to any Purchaser
Benefit Plan that is a medical, dental, other health, life insurance or
disability plan, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (a)
waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing condition exclusions and
requirements that would result in a lack of coverage of any pre-
existing condition of a Transferred Employee (or any dependent thereof) that
would have been covered under the Seller Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Employee (or eligible and enrolled dependent thereof) was a
participant immediately prior to the Closing Date, and credit or cause to be
credited any time accrued against applicable waiting periods relating to such
pre-existing condition and (b) waive any health eligibility, actively-at-work
or medical examination requirements under the Purchaser Benefit Plans.

  



  

(c) Purchaser agrees to cause its tax-qualified defined contribution plan for
U.S. employees to allow each Transferred Employee who has one or more account
balances in Sellers tax-qualified 401(k) plan to make a "direct rollover" of
such account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding
loans but excluding any Seller stock) from Sellers defined contribution plan
if such Transferred Employee elects to make such a rollover.

  



  

SECTION 6.05. _WARN Act Compliance_. Purchaser agrees to provide any
required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act,
as amended (the " **WARN Act** "), and any similar Law, and to otherwise
comply with the WARN Act and any such other similar Law with respect to any
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group
termination or similar event affecting Transferred Employees (including as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and occurring from and after the Closing Date. Seller shall comply
with the WARN Act or any similar Law with respect to any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar
event affecting Employees and occurring prior to the Closing Date. Provided
that on or before the Closing Date, Seller has provided to Purchaser a list
of employee layoffs, by date and location, implemented by the Seller in the
90-day period preceding the

  



        
   

  



  

Closing Date, Purchaser agrees not to take and to cause its Subsidiaries not
to take, any action that would create any Liability or penalty to Seller
under the WARN Act or any similar Law.

  



  

SECTION 6.06. _No Amendments or Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to
be an amendment to any Purchaser Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan or (ii)
require Purchaser to amend, modify, affect, or terminate any Purchaser
Benefit Plan (other than as may be required to reflect the obligations of the
Purchaser set forth in _Section 6.04_ above).

  



  

(b) The provisions of this _Section 6.06_ are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Employee), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section 6.06_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE VII

  



  

TAX MATTERS

  



  

SECTION 7.01. _Transfer Taxes._ Purchaser shall (or shall cause
its applicable Subsidiary to) be responsible for and pay and indemnify and
hold Seller and its Subsidiaries harmless from, any and all Transfer Taxes
imposed by any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements. In the event that any such Transfer Taxes are
required under applicable Law to be collected, remitted or paid by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries or any agent thereof (as requested by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries), Purchaser shall (on behalf of itself and of its
applicable Subsidiaries) pay the amount of such Transfer Taxes to Seller, any
of its Subsidiaries or any such agent, as applicable, at the Closing
or thereafter, as applicable, as requested of or by Seller. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, all payments due to Seller shall be made without any deduction
or withholding on account of any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law
in which case the sum payable by Purchaser in respect of which such deduction
or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to
ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, Seller receives and
retains (free from any Liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the
sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being
required.

  



  

SECTION 7.02. _Tax Characterization of Adjustments_. Seller and Purchaser
agree to treat, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to treat, all
payments made either to or for the benefit of the other under any indemnity
provisions of this Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breach of
warranty or covenants as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes
and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof.

  



  

SECTION 7.03. _Parties  Responsibility_. Subject to _Section 7.01_,
Seller, or a relevant Subsidiary of Seller, as applicable, is and shall
remain solely responsible for all Tax matters and Liabilities arising from or
relating to the Business or the Assets before the Closing

  



        
   

  



  

Date.  Purchaser, or a relevant Subsidiary of Purchaser, as applicable,
shall be solely responsible for all Tax matters and Liabilities arising from
or relating to the Business or the Assets on and after the Closing Date.
In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts of the Business for the portion of the
Straddle Period before the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as though the Taxable period of Seller, or its
Subsidiary, as applicable, ended on the calendar day immediately preceding
the Closing Date. The amount of other Taxes of the Business for the portion
of the Straddle Period up to the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
ending on the calendar day immediately preceding the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The
parties shall cooperate with each other concerning all Tax matters, including
the filing of all material federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns and
other governmental filings associated therewith.

the Closing Date as if restated at and as of the Closing Date and in the case
of each other representation and warranty contained in _Article III_, except
for any failure to be true and correct that has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, such representation
or warranty (disregarding all materiality and Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained therein), shall be true and correct (i) as if
restated on and as of the Closing Date or (ii) if made as of a date specified
therein, as of such date, and Purchaser shall have received a certificate
signed by a senior officer of Seller to such effect.

  



  

(b) The covenants, obligations and agreements contained in this Agreement to

Seller on or before the Closing, and Purchaser shall have received
a certificate signed by a senior officer of Seller to such effect.

  



  

(c) Each of Seller and, if applicable, its Subsidiaries shall have executed

ARTICLE IX 
  
 TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  



  

SECTION 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing (except as limited as to time in the case of
paragraph (b) below):

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

  



  

(b) by Seller or Purchaser, upon prior written notice to the other party, if
the Closing shall not have occurred prior to April 30, 2009 (the "
**Termination Date** "); except that if the waiting period under the HSR Act
shall not have expired or been terminated and, as of such date, all other
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ shall have been
satisfied or, for those conditions intended to be satisfied at the Closing,
shall be capable of being satisfied, the Termination Date may be extended
once by either party for an additional 90 days, in which case all references
to the Termination Date shall be to the Termination Date as extended;

  



  

(c) by Seller,

  



  

(i) upon prior written notice to Purchaser, in the event a condition set
forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ has not been satisfied, is not
reasonably capable of being satisfied and has not been waived by Seller, on
or prior to the Termination Date;

  



  

(ii) if the Seller (x) shall have given Purchaser written notice advising
Purchaser that it intends to enter into a Superior Alternative Transaction
(which shall include the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Alternative Transaction, including the identity of the party making such
proposal and, if available, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with such party and other material documents), (y) has complied in
all material respects with _Section 5.16_ and so certifies to Purchaser and
(z) not later than the day of such termination, Seller pays the Seller
Termination Fee to Purchaser in accordance with _Section 9.03(b)_; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not (and shall not have the right
to) terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(c)(ii)_
unless and until Seller shall have given the Purchaser five Business Days
after delivery of each such written notice to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall have negotiated in
good faith with the Purchaser with respect to such proposed revisions or
other proposal, if any, to cause such Alternative Transaction to cease to be
a Superior Alternative Transaction; it being agreed that if Purchaser agrees
to modify the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement such
that the Purchase Price hereunder is no lower than the aggregate purchase
price, as determined by the board of directors of Seller (after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), under the
Superior Alternative Transaction (inclusive of assumed liabilities and
reflecting terms of payment and the fair market value, as determined in good
faith by Sellers board of directors, of any non-cash

  



        
   

  



  

consideration included in the purchase price), Seller shall not have a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(c)(ii)_; or

  



  

(d) by Purchaser,

  



  

(i) upon prior written notice to Seller, in the event a condition set forth
in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03_ has not been satisfied, is not
reasonably capable of being satisfied and has not been waived by Purchaser,
on or prior to the Termination Date; or

  



  

(ii) if Seller delivers to Purchaser the written notice contemplated by
clause (x) of _Section 9.01(c)(ii)_.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.01_ to the contrary, the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c) or (d)
above shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision under
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the event or
condition purportedly giving rise to a right to terminate this Agreement
under such paragraph prior to the Closing.

  



  

SECTION 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Article IX_, this Agreement shall be
null and void and of no further force and effect, except as set forth in this
_Section 9.02_ and _Article XI_ (other than _Section 11.13_), all of
which shall survive any such termination, and there shall be no liability
or obligation on the part of any party, except (a) as set forth in _Section
9.03_ or (b) subject to _Section 9.03_, with respect to any Losses incurred
or suffered by a party that were the result of fraud or breach under this
Agreement prior to termination.

  



  

SECTION 9.03. _Termination Fee_.

  



  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 9.01(b)_ and at such time all conditions set forth in _Section
8.01_ and _Section 8.03_ (other than _Section 8.03(d))_ shall have been
satisfied or, for those conditions intended to be satisfied at the Closing,
shall be capable of being satisfied, then Seller shall irrevocably elect no
later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the fifth Business Day following such
termination either (x) to require Purchaser to pay Seller, promptly following
such election, a termination fee of $2,300,000 (the "
**Purchaser Termination Fee** "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (the " **Purchaser Fee Election** ") or (y) to irrevocably waive
Sellers right to receive the Purchaser Termination Fee and elect to pursue
monetary damages available to Purchaser under the terms of this Agreement
(the " **Purchaser Damages Election** "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if Seller makes the Purchaser Fee Election, and
Purchaser pays the Purchaser Termination Fee pursuant to the preceding
sentence, such Purchaser Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy, including on account of punitive damages, of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents for any and all Losses
suffered as a result of such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, if
Seller makes the Purchaser Fee Election and Purchaser pays the Purchaser
Termination Fee, Purchaser shall have no other liability for any breach of
this Agreement (regardless of the time of breach). If

  



        
   

  



  

Seller makes the Purchaser Damages Election, then Seller shall be entitled to
pursue monetary damages for only those Losses incurred or suffered by Seller
that were the result of fraud or material breach by the Purchaser of its
representations and warranties or covenants under this Agreement (other than
_Section 5.14_, which shall be subject to claims for breach without regard
to materiality) prior to termination. In no event shall Purchaser be
required to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee if Seller has not delivered the
Purchaser Fee Election in accordance with this _Section 9.03(a)_.

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(ii)_ or 
_Section 9.01(d)(ii)_, then Seller shall pay Purchaser $2,300,000 (the "
**Seller Termination Fee** ") not later than the day of such termination, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Purchasers receipt of the Seller Termination
Fee pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy, including on account of punitive damages, of the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents for any and all
Losses suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(c)(ii)_ or _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.03_  are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the amounts (if any) payable pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_ or
_Section 9.03(b) _ are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, in the circumstances in which such termination fee is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, without these agreements, neither Purchaser nor Seller would enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
fails to timely pay the Seller Termination Fee or Purchaser Termination Fee,
as applicable, when due in accordance with this _Section 9.03_ , and, in
order to obtain such payment, Purchaser or Seller, as the case may
be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for
the amounts set forth in this _Section 9.03_, such paying party shall
pay the other party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit.

  



  

ARTICLE X 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

SECTION 10.01. _Indemnification; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser from and against all Losses incurred by Purchaser, its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors (collectively the "
**Purchaser Indemnified Persons** ") that arise out of:

  



  

(i) any breach by Seller of any of Sellers representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement (disregarding, for purposes of calculating

  



        
   

  



  

damages but not for purposes of assessing whether a breach has occurred, any
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained therein);

  



  

(ii) any breach by Seller of its covenants contained in this Agreement; or

  



  

(iii) any Retained Liabilities or Excluded Assets.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller from and against all Losses incurred by Seller, its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors (collectively the "
**Seller Indemnified Persons** ") that arise out of:

  



  

(i) any breach by Purchaser of any of Purchasers representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any breach by Purchaser of its covenants contained in this Agreement; or

(c) Sellers and Purchasers indemnification obligation under _Section
10.1(a)_ shall be subject to each of the following limitations:

  



  

(i) with respect to indemnification under _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ or solely
with respect to covenants performed prior to Closing, _Section
10.01(a)(ii)_, for Losses arising out of or relating to any breaches of any
representation or warranty by Seller in this Agreement, such obligation to
indemnify shall survive the Closing and terminate on September 1, 2010,
except for (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.01
(Organization and Good Standing), 3.02 (Authority), 3.08(b) (Ownership of the
Assets) and 3.13 (Brokers), which shall survive indefinitely (the "
**Fundamental Representations** ") and (ii) the representations and
warranties in Section 3.15 (Taxes), which shall terminate 90 days following
the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation, in each such case
unless before such date Purchaser has provided Seller with an applicable
Claim Notice;

  



  

(ii) there shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 10.01(a)(i)_
or solely with respect to covenants performed prior to Closing, _Section
10.01(a)(ii)_ (A) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Seller, but
for this clause (A), would be liable under _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ and solely
with respect to covenants performed prior to Closing, _Section 10.01(a)(ii)_
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $750,000 (the "
**Deductible** "), and then only to the extent of such excess; or (B) for any
amount, once the aggregate indemnification paid by Seller under _Section
10.01(a)(i)_ or solely with respect to covenants performed prior to Closing,
_Section 10.01(a)(ii)_ exceeds $23,000,000; provided that the Deductible
shall not apply to a breach of any Fundamental Representation or _Section
3.11_ (Environmental Matters);

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) there shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 10.01(a)_ to
the extent the Loss (A) consists of a liability that was included in
the determination of Final Working Capital, or (B) relates to any breach
of representation, warranty, or covenant expressly and specifically waived,
in writing, by Purchaser;

  



  

(iv) there shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 10.01(b)_ to
the extent the Loss relates to any breach of representation, warranty, or
covenant expressly and specifically waived, in writing, by Seller;

  



  

(v) each Loss incurred by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person shall
be reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually recovered by
Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss; (B)
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment payable to Purchaser or
any Purchaser Indemnified Person by any third party with respect to such
Loss; and (C) an amount equal to any reduction of cash Taxes currently
payable if such reduction is attributable (on a marginal basis) to such Loss,
with such reduction in Loss taken into account at the time that the reduction
in cash Taxes currently payable is actually recognized for the taxable period
in question; and

  



  

(vi) each Loss incurred by Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person shall be
reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually recovered by
Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss; (B) any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment payable to Seller or any
Seller Indemnified Person by any third party with respect to such Loss; and
(C) an amount equal to any reduction of cash Taxes currently payable if such
reduction is attributable (on a marginal basis) to such Loss, with such
reduction in Loss taken into account at the time that the reduction in cash
Taxes currently payable is actually recognized for the taxable period in
question.

  



  

SECTION 10.02. _Notice of Claim; Defense_.

  



  

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Authority institutes, threatens
or asserts any Action that may give rise to Losses for which a party (an "
**Indemnifying Party** ") may be liable for indemnification under this
_Article X_ (a " **Third-Party Claim** ") or (ii) any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an " **Indemnified Party** ") shall
have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve
a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly send to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature of such claim
and the amount of all related Losses (a " **Claim Notice** "). The
Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations under
this _Article X_ only if (and then only to the extent that) it is actually
prejudiced by the failure of the Indemnified Parties to provide a timely and
adequate Claim Notice.

  



  

(b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
retain counsel of its choice to represent such Indemnified Parties in
connection with such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements
of such counsel so long as (i) the

  



        
   

  



  

Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party, within thirty (30) days
after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim to the
Indemnifying Party, that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense
against (or settlement of) such Third Party Claim and will indemnify the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim in its name or, if
necessary, in the name of the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms
and limitations of this Article X; provided, that (A) the Indemnified Parties
and their counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in connection with such Action and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the conduct and control of such settlement and defense if
(w) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (x)
the Indemnified Party is advised by counsel chosen by it that there are one
or more defenses available to the Indemnified Party which the Indemnifying
Party has not or cannot assert on behalf of the Indemnified Party or (y)
the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Action without
the relevant Indemnified Parties prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), unless (1) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are entirely paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party, (2)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of applicable law and (3)
such settlement includes an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such claim, and, in addition to the foregoing the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle any third party claim with respect to Taxes that could
adversely affect the Indemnified Party without prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain
counsel and assume control of such defense or is otherwise not entitled to do
so in accordance with this Section 10.02, then the Indemnified Parties
shall assume control of the defense in connection with such Action, and the
fees, charges and disbursements of no more than one such counsel per
jurisdiction selected by the Indemnified Parties shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have
any liability in connection with any settlement of any Action that is entered
into without its prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

  



  

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and representatives full access,
during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties
of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice
at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties).

  



  

SECTION 10.03. _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting an Asset, an Assumed Liability, an Excluded Asset or a
Retained Liability, or a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, as applicable.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Persons in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether under this contract or arising under common law or any other
Law) shall be as provided in

  



        
   

  



  

this _Article X_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Article
X_ shall limit in any way either partys remedies in respect of intentional
fraud by the other party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition, nothing in this _Section 10.03(b)_
shall operate to interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of
_Section 2.03(d)_ or  _Section 2.04_ or Purchasers right to seek equitable
remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief) to enforce
_Section 5.03_,  _Section 5.17_ and _Section 5.18_.

  



  

SECTION 10.04. _Limitation on Set-off_. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to
this _Article X_ against any payment due pursuant to _Article II_.

  



  

SECTION 10.05. _Mitigation_. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each
other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which
one party is obligated to indemnify the other party under this _Article
X_, including by making reasonable best efforts to mitigate, whether by
seeking claims against a third party, an insurer or otherwise.

  



  

ARTICLE XI 
  
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

SECTION 11.01. _Waiver_. Either party may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party to be bound thereby. Any failure to assert, or delay in the
assertion of, rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

  



  

SECTION 11.02. _Expenses_.

Agreements, the parties shall bear their respective direct and indirect costs

SECTION 11.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of

long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated

11.07_ shall be null and void.

  



  

SECTION 11.08. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the rights of the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons and Seller Indemnified Persons under _Article
X_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their

shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 11.09. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties.

  



  

SECTION 11.10. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

  



  

(a) Any questions, claims, disputes, remedies or Actions arising from or

(iv) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any
such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 11.03_ or any
other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient

Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or
thereby. Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 11.10_.

  



  

SECTION 11.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts,
