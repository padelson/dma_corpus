Worth Calculation shall be adjusted to reflect a ratable sharing in equal
portions by Buyer and the Escrow Noteholders (other than the holders of New
Demand Note Debt), of the amount of accrued payroll liability accruing from
May 1, 2002, through the date of this Agreement. Such accrued payroll
liability shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the Financial

Balance Sheet and the Net Worth Calculation as delivered pursuant to Section
3.4(a). Buyer shall provide the Noteholder Representative with reasonable
access to the books and records of the Company in order to verify the
accuracy of the Net Worth Calculation.   (c) In the event that the
Noteholder Representative and Buyer fail to agree on any of the Noteholder
Representative\'s proposed adjustments set forth in the Net Worth Adjustment
Report within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives the Net Worth Adjustment
Report, the Noteholders and Buyer agree that a mutually acceptable
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (the
"INDEPENDENT AUDITORS") within the 30-day period immediately following such
30-day period, shall make the final determination of the Net Worth
Calculation. Buyer and the Noteholder Representative shall each provide the
Independent Auditors with their respective determinations of the Net
Worth Calculation. The decision of the Independent Auditors shall be final
and binding on the Noteholders and Buyer and the fees, costs and expenses of
the Independent Auditors shall be borne by Buyer if the Net Worth Calculation
is increased by at least 10%; otherwise, such fees, costs and expenses shall
be borne by the Noteholders in accordance with Section 9.3.   (d) The term
"TESTING BALANCE SHEET" as that term has been hereinbefore, and will be
hereinafter, used shall mean the Testing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to
Section 3.4(a) as adjusted, if at all, pursuant to Sections 3.4(b) and (c).
The date on which the Testing Balance Sheet and the Net Worth Calculation are
finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "NET WORTH SETTLEMENT DATE".   (e) To the extent that items in the
Testing Balance Sheet represent adjustments to items in the Financial
Statements and such adjustments have been satisfied from the Escrow Fund,
such adjustments may not also be the basis of a claim for Adverse
Consequences under Article IX.   3.5 Net Worth Payment.   (a) In the event
that the final Net Worth Calculation is less than ($150,000) or greater than
$150,000, no later than fifteen (15) days after the Net Worth Settlement
Date, (i) Buyer shall pay to the Noteholder Representative for the pro rata
benefit of the Noteholders (other than the Noteholders of the New Demand Note
Debt) an amount equal to the Net Worth Calculation, if positive,    
14    and (ii) the Noteholder Representative on behalf of the Noteholders
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of the Net Worth
Calculation, if negative.   (b) Any payment required to be paid by the
Buyer pursuant to Section 3.5(a) shall be made to the Noteholder
Representative for the pro rata benefit of the Noteholders (other than the
Noteholders of the New Demand Note Debt) by certified or cashier\'s check, or
by the transfer of immediately available federal funds for credit at a bank
account designated in writing by the Noteholder Representative.   (c) Any
payment required to be paid by the Noteholders pursuant to Section 3.5(a)
shall be made from the Escrow Fund in accordance with procedures set forth in
Section 9.3 and the Escrow Agreement.   3.6 Earn-out Adjustment. (a) Within
forty-five (45) days after the end of (i) the period commencing on the date
immediately following the Closing Date and ending October 31, 2003, and (ii)
the twelve-month period commencing November 1, 2003 and ending October 31,
2004 (each, a "PERIOD"), Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Noteholder
Representative an "earn-out" calculation in accordance with Exhibit E for
such prior Period (the "EARN-OUT CALCULATION"). The Earn-out Calculation
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the principles and
terms described on Exhibit E hereto.   (b) Within thirty (30) days after the
Earn-out Calculation is delivered to the Noteholder Representative pursuant
to Section 3.6(a) for each respective Period, the Noteholder Representative
shall deliver to Buyer either (i) a written acknowledgment accepting the
Earn-out Calculation for such Period or (ii) a written report setting forth
in reasonable detail any proposed adjustments to the Earn-out Calculation for
such Period (the "EARN-OUT ADJUSTMENT REPORT"). If the Noteholder
Representative fails to respond to Buyer within such 30-day period for each
respective Period, the Noteholders shall be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the Earn-out Calculation as delivered pursuant to Section 3.6(a)
for such Period. Buyer shall provide the Noteholder Representative with
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company in order to verify
the accuracy of any Earn-out Calculation.   (c) In the event that the
Noteholder Representative and Buyer fail to agree on any of the Noteholder
Representative\'s proposed adjustments set forth in the Earn-out Adjustment
Report for each respective Period within thirty (30) days after Buyer
receives the Earn-out Adjustment Report, the Noteholders and Buyer agree that
Independent Auditors within the 30-day period immediately following such
30-day period for such Period, shall make the final determination of the
Earn-out Calculation. Buyer and the Noteholder Representative shall
each provide the Independent Auditors with their respective determinations of
the Earn-out Calculation. The decision of the Independent Auditors shall be
final and binding on the Noteholders and Buyer and the fees, costs and
expenses of the Independent Auditors shall be borne by Buyer if the Earn-out
Calculation is increased by at least 10%; otherwise, such fees, costs and
expenses shall be borne by the Noteholders in accordance with Section
9.3.   (d) The date on which the Earn-out Calculation is finally determined
for each respective Period pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "EARN-OUT SETTLEMENT DATE" for such Period.   3.7 Earn-
out Payments. (a) No later than fifteen (15) days after the Earn-out
Settlement Date for each respective Period, Buyer shall pay to the holders of
the Series 2 Sub Debt and the holders of the Series 1 Sub Debt in accordance
with Section 3.2(c) and (d), respectively, in the aggregate, an amount (the
"EARN-OUT AMOUNT") specified in the Earn-out Calculation, if any, pursuant to
the terms of Section     15  3.6(b), together with interest thereon at
the rate of 8% per annum which shall accrue from the end of such applicable
Period until the date paid to the holders of Series 2 Sub Debt and Series 1
Sub Debt pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, notwithstanding the
actual Earn-out Calculation, the aggregate amounts payable in each such
Period shall not in any event exceed $3,000,000 (exclusive of interest).  
(b) The Earn-out Amount for each respective Period shall be paid by the Buyer
to holders of Series 2 Sub Debt and holders of Series 1 Sub Debt in
accordance with Section 3.2(c) and (d), respectively, in cash or in Buyer
Common Stock, in the sole discretion of the Buyer. All shares of Buyer Common
Stock issued pursuant to this Section 3.7(a) shall be registered for resale
under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws and shall
be eligible for immediate public sale. Such shares shall not be subject
to Section 6.8 of this Agreement or any other restrictions on transfer. To
the extent that the Buyer pays such amount in Buyer Common Stock, such shares
shall be valued at the volume-weighted average of the prices of the Buyer
Common Stock on the Nasdaq on each of the 15 trading days ending on (and
including) the date immediately prior to the Earn-out Settlement Date.  
(c) Each of the Buyer, Merger Sub, and each Noteholder agrees to treat the
Earn-out Payments as debt instruments for income Tax purposes governed by
Treasury Regulation section 1.1275-4(c).   3.8 Effect on Stock Options. At
or prior to the Effective Time, each option or other right to purchase shares
of any Company Capital Stock (a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") granted under any
Company Option Plan which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Capital
Stock and shall be cancelled pursuant to the terms hereof. Neither the Merger
Sub nor the Surviving Corporation shall assume the Company Option Plans or
the Company Stock Options, and no options shall be substituted therefor.  
3.9 Exchange Procedures. (a) After the Effective Time, each holder of
a Company Certificate immediately prior to the Merger may surrender the same
for cancellation to Buyer, and each such holder shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the terms hereof. Until so surrendered, each such Company
Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration and other rights
hereunder.   (b) After the Effective Time, each holder of a Company
Note shall surrender the same for cancellation to Buyer, and shall receive
in exchange therefor the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the terms hereof. After the Closing, until so surrendered, each
such Company Note shall be deemed for all purposes to represent only the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration and other
rights hereunder.   (c) The registered owner on the books and records of
Buyer of any such Company Note exchangeable for the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration shall, until such Company Note shall have been
surrendered pursuant to this Section 3.9, have and be entitled to exercise
any applicable voting rights with respect to the Buyer Capital Stock
represented by such certificate as provided above, if applicable.   (d) At
the Effective Time, the Buyer shall make available for exchange in accordance

pursuant to Section 3.2. All cash amounts payable by the Buyer pursuant to
this Section 3.9(d) shall be paid, in the Buyer\'s sole discretion,   
16   by certified or cashier\'s check, or by wire transfer of immediately
available federal funds for credit to a bank account designated in writing at
least two days prior to Closing by each respective Shareholder or
Noteholder.   3.10 No Further Rights in Company. All cash paid upon
conversion of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all obligations pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock. All cash
paid to holders of New Demand Note Debt in accordance with the terms of this
Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
obligations of the Company to such holders of New Demand Note Debt. All
shares of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Warrants issued and cash paid to the
respective Noteholders of Series 1 Sub Debt, Series 2 Sub Debt and Demand
Note Debt in accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any
cash paid pursuant to Section 3.11 and any amounts paid pursuant to Section
3.7) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all
obligations of the Company to such Noteholders pursuant to the Series 1 Sub
Debt, Series 2 Sub Debt and Demand Note Debt.   3.11 No Fractional Shares of
Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Warrants. (a) No certificates or scrip or shares
of Buyer Common Stock representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock or
book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Company Notes, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Buyer or a
holder of shares of Buyer Common Stock. In lieu of any such fractional share,
each holder of Series 1 Sub Debt, Series 2 Sub Debt and Demand Note Debt that
would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Buyer Common
Stock upon surrender of Company Notes (determined after taking into account
all Company Notes delivered by such holder) or pursuant to Section 3.7, shall
be paid, upon such surrender, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such holder\'s proportionate interest in the value of the Excess Shares
pursuant to the terms hereof. The Buyer shall determine the excess of (i) the
number of full shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to,
this Agreement (otherwise than upon exercise of the Buyer Warrants) over (ii)
the aggregate number of full shares of Buyer Common Stock to be distributed
to holders of Series 1 Sub Debt, Series 2 Sub Debt and Demand Note Debt
(such excess, the "EXCESS SHARES"), and the Buyer shall calculate the value
of the Excess Shares based upon the Buyer Share Market Value. The Company
shall pay such amounts to such former holders of Series 1 Sub Debt, Series 2
Sub Debt and Demand Note Debt at the Closing.   (b) No Buyer Warrant
representing the right to purchase fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock

company, any Person that is a current or former member of such Noteholder or
(v) to any affiliate of such Noteholder; provided, that the transferee of
such Buyer Common Stock shall agree to be bound by the limitations set forth
in this Section 6.8.     44    6.9 Public Announcements. Buyer, OpCo,
Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to the

Effective Time or (B) to cause any covenant, condition or agreement under
this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in any material respect
and (ii) any failure of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder in any material respect; provided, however, that no

or the conditions to the obligations of any party hereunder. Each of Buyer
and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or
other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions

not exercised on or before the Effective Time, as of the Effective Time, on
terms and conditions satisfactory to Buyer. Prior to the Effective Time,

during such two-year period.     45    (b) In the event of a breach or
threatened breach of this Section 6.13, Buyer shall be entitled to an

Rights. Buyer will, within six (6) months after the Closing Date, prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3, (the "S-3
REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Buyer Common Stock issued in connection with this
Agreement, and the Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Buyer Warrants or pursuant to Section 3.7, as the case may be, containing a
resale prospectus for such Buyer Common Stock in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of such Buyer Common Stock. The Buyer
will, and will cause its accountants and lawyers to, use their reasonable
best efforts to have or cause the S-3 Registration Statement declared
effective as promptly as practicable after such filing, including, without
limitation, causing its accountants to deliver necessary or required
instruments such as opinions, consents and certificates, and will take any
other action required or necessary to be taken under federal or state
securities laws or otherwise in connection with the registration process.
Buyer shall also take any action required to be taken under state "blue sky"
or other securities laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Buyer
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement or the Buyer Warrants and pursuant to
the S-3 Registration Statement. The Noteholders acknowledge that the Escrow
Shares shall be subject to the provisions of Article IX. In connection with
the S-3 Registration Statement, Buyer will:   (i) prepare and file with the
SEC such amendments and  supplements to such registration statement and the
prospectus  used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such 
registration statement effective until the time that all the  shares of Buyer
Common Stock have been sold pursuant thereto  or pursuant to Rule 144 under
the Securities Act and to comply  with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the  disposition of all Buyer Common Stock covered by such 
registration statement during such time in accordance with the  intended
methods of disposition by the holders thereof set  forth in such registration
statement;   (ii) furnish to each holder of Buyer Common Stock  covered by
such registration such reasonable number of copies  of such registration
statement, each amendment and supplement  thereto, the prospectus included in
such registration  statement (including each preliminary prospectus) and
such  other documents as such     46    holder may reasonably request
in order to facilitate the  disposition of such Buyer Common Stock;   (iii)
notify each holder of Buyer Common Stock  covered by such registration, at
any time when a prospectus  relating thereto is required to be delivered
under the  Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of 
which the prospectus included in such registration statement  (or any
document incorporated therein by reference) contains  an untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state any  fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading,  and prepare a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus (or  any document incorporated therein by reference) immediately 
thereafter so that such prospectus (or any document  incorporated therein by
reference) will not contain an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit
to state any fact  necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading;   (iv) cause all such Buyer Common Stock covered by  such
registration to be listed on each securities exchange or  automated quotation
system on which similar securities issued  by the Buyer are then listed;  
(v) make available at the Company\'s principal place  of business for
inspection by any holder of Buyer Common Stock  covered by such registration,
and any attorney, accountant or  other agent retained by any such holder, all
financial and  other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties
of  Buyer and cause Buyer\'s officers, directors and employees to  supply
all information reasonably requested by any such  holder, attorney,
accountant or agent in connection with such  registration statement or such
other document;   (vi) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to  comply
with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC;   (vii) pay all
registration expenses for the S-3  Registration Statement, except for
underwriting discounts and  commissions and agency fees and the fees and
disbursements of  any counsel or other advisors retained by any holder of
Buyer  Common Stock; and   (viii) indemnify each holder of Buyer Common
Stock  included in the S-3 Registration Statement, each such holder\'s 
officers, directors and partners, and each person controlling  such holder
(within the meaning of the Securities Act and the  rules and regulations
thereunder), against all claims, losses,  damages, liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) and  expenses arising out of or based on any untrue or
alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in the S-3 
Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus  or any omission
or alleged omission to state therein a  material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to  make the statements therein not misleading, or any
violation  by Buyer of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation 
thereunder which violation relates to action or inaction  required of Buyer
in connection with such registration, and  will reimburse each such holder,
such holder\'s officers,  directors, partners and members, and each person
controlling  such holder for any legal and any other expenses incurred in 
connection with investigating or defending any such claim,  loss, damage,
liability or action, provided that Buyer will  not be liable in any such case
to the extent that any such  claim, loss, damage, liability or action arises
out of or is  based on any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission
or  alleged omission of     47    material fact based upon written
information furnished to  Buyer by such holder and stated to be specifically
for use  therein.   Each such holder will, severally and not jointly, 
indemnify each of Buyer, each of Buyer\'s directors and  officers and each
person who controls Buyer (within the  meaning of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations  thereunder), each other holder whose Buyer Common
Stock is  included in such registration and each of such other holder\'s 
officers, directors and partners and each person controlling  such other
holder, against all claims, losses, damages and  liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) and expenses  arising out of or based on any untrue or
alleged statement of  a material fact contained in any such registration
statement,  prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any omission or  alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to  be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein  not misleading, and will reimburse
Buyer, its officers and  directors, each person controlling Buyer, each such
other  holder, and such other holder\'s officers, directors, partners  and
control persons for any legal and any other expenses  reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating or  defending any such claim, loss, damage,
liability or action,  in each case to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such  untrue or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission is 
made in such registration statement, prospectus or preliminary  prospectus in
reliance upon and in conformity with written  information furnished to Buyer
by such holder and stated to be  specifically for use therein; provided,
however, that no such  holder shall be required to undertake liability to
any  Indemnified Party under this Section 6.15 for any amounts in  excess of
the dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of  such holder\'s
registrable Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Common  Stock issuable upon exercise
of the Buyer Warrants pursuant to  the S-3 Registration Statement. The
indemnification  obligations of the holders of Buyer Common Stock included
in  the S-3 Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 6.15  shall be
in addition to any liabilities such holder may  otherwise have pursuant to
this Agreement and the  indemnification obligations hereunder shall not be
subject to  any limitations on liabilities set forth elsewhere in this 
Agreement.   Each party entitled to indemnification under this  Section
6.15 (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give notice to the  party required to
provide indemnification (an "INDEMNIFYING  PARTY") promptly after such
Indemnified Party has actual  knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity
may be sought,  and, unless in such Indemnified Party\'s reasonable judgment
a  conflict of interest may exist between such Indemnified Party  and such
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim, shall  permit the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of any  such claim or any litigation resulting
therefrom provided that  counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall
conduct the  defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, 
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and  the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such  party\'s expense,
and provided, further, that the failure of  any Indemnified Party to give
notice as provided herein shall  not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under  this Section 6.15, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying  Party\'s ability to conduct such defense shall have been 
materially prejudiced by such failure. To the extent that, in  the opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict of  interest exists between an
Indemnified Party and the  Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party
shall be  entitled to separate counsel at the expense of the  Indemnifying
Party. Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such  information regarding
itself or the claim in question as an  Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request in writing and as  shall be reasonably required in connection with
the defense of  such claim and any litigation resulting therefrom.    
48    Each holder of Buyer Common Stock included in the S-3  Registration
Statement shall furnish to Buyer such information  regarding such holder and
the distribution proposed by such  holder as the Buyer may reasonably request
in writing and as  shall be reasonably required in connection with any 
registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this  Section
6.15.   6.16 Tax Matters and Indemnity.   (a) Each of the parties hereto
agrees that, for all federal, state, and local income Tax purposes, (i) the
Company Notes shall be treated as equity in the Company and (ii) the Merger
shall be treated as a sale by the Company of its assets to Merger Sub in
consideration for the Merger Consideration and the assumption of the
Company\'s liabilities by Merger Sub (the "DEEMED ASSET SALE") followed by
the liquidation of the Company. Each of the parties agrees not to take any
position, or make any filing, with a taxing authority, that is inconsistent
with the foregoing sentence.   (b) The parties shall use their best efforts
to enter into an agreement as soon as possible after the Closing Date to
allocate the Merger Consideration and assumed liabilities to the assets of
the Company acquired in the Deemed Asset Sale in accordance with Code section
1060 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer shall deliver to the
Noteholder Representative a proposed allocation of the Merger Consideration
and assumed liabilities within 60 days after the Closing Date. If the
Noteholder Representative does not object in writing to the proposed
allocation within 20 days, such proposed allocation shall be deemed accepted
and used in completing the final income Tax Returns of the Company. If the
Noteholder Representative objects to Buyer\'s proposed allocation, the
Noteholder Representative shall give Buyer its reasons for the objection, and
Buyer and the Noteholder Representative shall use reasonable efforts to
resolve their differences. If 30 days after the date on which the Noteholder
Representative has given Buyer its notice of objections, the parties have not
adopted an agreed allocation, any dispute related thereto shall be referred
to, and resolved by, the Independent Auditors within 30 days after
such referral. The Independent Auditors\' determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto. The costs, expenses, and fees of
the Independent Auditors shall be paid from the Escrow Fund. The Buyer shall
use the agreed allocation pursuant to this Section 6.16(b) to complete IRS
Form 8594 for the Company and for Merger Sub and to complete the final income
Tax Returns of the Company. A copy of the Company\'s and Merger Sub\'s IRS
Form 8594 shall be delivered to the Noteholder Representative.   (c) Buyer
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, the 2001 income Tax
Returns of the Company and the final income Tax Returns of the Company for
the taxable period that ends on the Closing Date. At least 30 days prior to
the due date of such Tax Returns, Buyer shall submit to the Noteholder
Representative for its review a copy of each such Tax Return. If Noteholder
Representative objects to a Tax Return in writing within 10 days of its
submission, Buyer and Noteholder Representative will negotiate to
resolve their differences before the due date of the Tax Return; provided
however, Buyer shall not be required to accept the Noteholder
Representative\'s comments unless the Noteholder Representative (i) agrees in
writing to separately indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to such
income Tax Return for as long as the statute of limitation for such return is
open, (ii) posts with Buyer such securities, cash, or other property to
secure such indemnity for such period as Buyer determines is necessary and
(iii) provides Buyer, at Noteholder Representative\'s expense, with an
opinion of the Independent Auditors or nationally recognized tax counsel that
Noteholder Representative\'s position will more likely than not be upheld
upon challenge. If no written objection is made to Buyer within such 10-day
period, Noteholder Representative will be deemed to have accepted such income
Tax Returns. Except as otherwise provided in this section 6.16(c), any Taxes
due with respect to such income Tax Returns or third-party out-of-pocket
costs in preparing such Tax Returns shall be paid only from the Escrow
Fund.     49    (d) Within 30 days of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and file for the Company IRS Form 966 identifying the Merger as a
liquidation of the Company. If required by applicable law, Buyer shall cause
the Company to timely prepare and file with the IRS and each non-exempt
recipient of the Merger Consideration IRS Form 1099-DIV to report liquidation
proceeds.   (e) Without the prior written approval of the Buyer,
the Noteholders shall not allow the Company on or before the Effective Time:
(i) to change its fiscal year, (ii) to make any Tax election that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Buyer or its Affiliates, (iii) to change any
Tax method of accounting, (iv) to settle any Tax claim or assessment, or (v)
to surrender any right to claim a Tax refund or to any extension or waiver of
the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment.   (f) The
Noteholders shall cause the Company to prepare and file all Tax Returns of
the Company due (taking into account any effective extensions in the time for
filing) on or prior to the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be prepared
and filed timely (taking into account any effective extensions in the time
for filing) and on a basis consistent with prior practice with respect to the
treatment of specific items on such Tax Returns; provided, however, that if
the treatment of an item on any such Tax Return has not been provided by
prior practice, the Noteholders shall cause the Company to report such items
in a manner that would result in the least amount of Tax liability to the
Buyer and its Affiliates for periods ending after the Closing Date
provided there is controlling legal support for such position and to do so
does not cause or increase a tax liability of the Company. Buyer shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to prepare and file all Tax Returns of the Company
and Merger Sub due after the Closing Date; which Tax Returns, to the extent
they relate to taxable periods of the Company beginning prior to the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date, shall be prepared and filed timely
and on a basis consistent with existing procedures for preparing such Tax
Returns and in a manner consistent with prior practice with respect to the
treatment of specific items on such Tax Returns, unless such treatment does
not have sufficient legal support to avoid the imposition of penalties.  
(g) Buyer and the Noteholders shall provide each other with such assistance
as may reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any
taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall include making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies
of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The party requesting
assistance hereunder shall reimburse the assisting party for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in providing assistance. Buyer and the
Noteholders will retain for the full period of any statute of limitations and
provide the others with any records or information which may be relevant to
such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination.   (h)
During the period in which the Escrow Fund is in place or a separate
indemnity agreement is in place pursuant to Section 6.16(c), if in connection
with any examination, investigation, audit or other proceeding in respect of
any Tax Return covering the operations of the Company on or before the
Closing Date, any governmental body or authority issues to the
Company, Buyer, or Merger Sub a written notice of deficiency, a notice of
reassessment, a proposed adjustment, an assertion of claim or demand
concerning the taxable period covered by such Tax Return, Buyer shall notify
Noteholders of its receipt of such communication from the governmental body
or authority within thirty (30) business days after receiving such
communication. No failure or delay of Buyer in the performance of the
foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of
Noteholders pursuant to this Section 6.16, except to the extent that such
failure or delay shall have adversely affected the Noteholders\' ability to
defend against any liability or claim for Taxes that the Noteholders are
obligated to pay hereunder. Except as provided below, during the period in
which the Escrow Fund is in place or a     50   separate indemnity
agreement is in place pursuant to Section 6.16(c) the Noteholders shall, at
their expense, have the right to participate in the contest of any such
assessment, proposal, claim, reassessment, demand or other proceedings in
connection with any Tax Return covering taxable periods of the Company ending
on or before the Closing Date. Buyer will not settle or resolve any issues
related to Taxes for such period unless it obtains the prior written consent
of the Noteholder Representative. If any examination, investigation, audit or
other proceeding relates to a Tax Return for a period that begins after the
Closing Date or begins before and ends after the Closing Date, Buyer and
its Affiliates shall solely participate in, control and resolve such
examination, investigation, audit or other proceeding, provided that, during
the period in which the Escrow Fund is in place or a separate indemnity
agreement is in place pursuant to Section 6.16(c), Buyer shall communicate
with the Noteholders regarding the status of such examination, investigation,
audit or proceeding, and Buyer shall not settle or resolve any examination,
investigation, audit or other proceeding for Taxes for a taxable period
(including portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date unless it
obtains the approval of the Noteholder Representative or agrees to release
the Noteholders from any indemnification liability with respect to such Tax
claim. After the Escrow Fund and any separate indemnity agreement under
Section 6.16(c) hereof have terminated, the Noteholders shall have no further
right to participate in an examination, investigation, audit or other
proceeding for Taxes of the Company unless the Noteholders separately agree
in writing to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to such Taxes
and post with Buyer such securities, cash, or other property to secure such
indemnity for such period as Buyer determines is necessary.   (i) The
Noteholders shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates for any losses and
expenses (including attorneys\' fees and costs) incurred with respect to (i)
Taxes of the Company for taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or
prior to the Closing Date; or (ii) failing to comply with their obligations
under this Section 6.16. With respect to liability for Taxes of the Company
for a taxable period that begins before but does not end on the Closing Date,
the Tax liability shall be deemed allocated to the period prior to
the Closing Date based on the number of days in the period before and
including the Closing Date to the number of days in the whole taxable period.
If there is an adjustment on any Tax Return for the Company which creates a
deficiency in Taxes for which Noteholders are liable under this Section 6.16,
Buyer may withdraw the Taxes from the Escrow Fund only. Except with respect
to Taxes on the final income Tax Returns of the Company described in Section
6.16(c), no indemnity of Noteholders shall be payable under this Section 6.16
until the occurrence of any action by any taxing authority that is final or,
if not final, is acquiesced in by Noteholders during the course of any audit
or any proceeding relating to Taxes. The indemnity obligations under this
Section 6.16 shall control over any provisions in Section 9.3 of this
Agreement, except that Section 9.3 shall govern any indemnity with respect to
any breach by the Company of its representations and warranties in Section
4.1(p).   (j) Each Noteholder shall be responsible for, and indemnify the
Buyer with respect to, any recording, transfer, documentation, or similar Tax
imposed or resulting on the exchange of the Buyer Common Stock for
the Company Notes.   (k) Except to the extent the Noteholders elect to
enter into a separate indemnity agreement pursuant to Section 6.16(c), the
indemnification obligations of the Escrow Noteholders under this Section 6.16
constitute and shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy of the Buyer
against the Noteholders for any Adverse Consequence arising out of or
relating to (i) Taxes of the Company for taxable periods or portions thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the failure of any Noteholder
to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.16. Except to the extent
the Noteholders elect to enter into a separate indemnity agreement pursuant
to Section 6.16(c), the maximum amount of any payments for Adverse
Consequences arising under this Section 6.16, together with any payments for
Adverse Consequences arising under Section 9.3, shall not exceed the value of
the Escrow Fund. Except to the extent the Noteholders elect to enter into a
separate indemnity agreement pursuant to Section    51    6.16(c),
after the Closing Date, the sole remedy of the Buyer with respect to every
matter under this Section 6.16 and the sole source of satisfying such remedy
shall be, the Escrow Fund.   6.17 Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop,
market, commercialize and sell the Surviving Corporation\'s products and
services.   6.18 Director and Officer Indemnification. (a) For four years
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company (each a "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses (including reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel and judgments, fines, losses, claims,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (provided that any such settlement
is effected with the prior written consent of Buyer, which will not be
unreasonably withheld)) arising in whole or in part out of actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time to the full extent permitted under DGCL (or the laws of such other state
in which the Surviving Corporation may subsequently be domesticated if at
least as favorable) or the Surviving Corporation\'s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, except to the extent such amounts are paid under
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance; provided, that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether a
Company Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies with the standards set forth
under the DGCL (or the laws of such other state in which the Surviving
Corporation may be subsequently be domesticated if at least as favorable),
the Surviving Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the
case may be, shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Indemnified Party; and provided,
further, that nothing herein shall impair any rights or obligations of any
Company Indemnified Party. In the event that any claim or claims are brought
against any Company Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), such Company Indemnified Party may select counsel for the
defense of such claim, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Buyer.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   7.1 Conditions to Each

waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:   (a)

mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer;   (b) by the Company if

warranty or covenant of this Agreement);   (c) by Buyer if any Noteholder or
the Company is in material breach of any material representation, warranty or
covenant under this Agreement (and OpCo, Merger Sub or Buyer are not then in
material breach of any material representation, warranty or covenant);  
(d) by the Company if, at or before the Closing, any condition set forth
herein for the benefit of Noteholders and the Company shall not have been
timely met and cannot be met on or before the Closing Date and has not
been waived;   (e) by the Company, if, prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval having been obtained, the Company receives an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company\'s Board
of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with its independent
legal counsel and financial advisor is a Superior Proposal;   (f) by Buyer
if, at or before the Closing, any condition set forth herein for the benefit
of Buyer, OpCo or Merger Sub shall not have been timely met and cannot be
timely met on or before the Closing Date and has not been waived; or   (g)
by Buyer or the Company or the Noteholder Representative if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before May 17, 2002 (and such terminating party is
not then in material breach of any material representation, warranty or
covenant of this Agreement).   8.2 Effect of Termination.   (a) In the
event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Buyer as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto or their
respective officers or directors except with respect to Section 4.1(x),
Section 4.2(m), Section 6.2, Section 6.7, Section 6.9, this Section 8.2 and
Article X, which provisions shall survive such termination; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Buyer nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its willful material breach of this Agreement.   (b)
In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Buyer
as provided in Section 8.1, all confidential and/or proprietary information
of either party that is in the possession of the other party at the time of
such termination, including, without limitation, all computer software,
technical information, designs, schematics, documents, reports, manuals,
memoranda, business     55   information or customer lists, shall be
immediately returned to the property owner, and the confidentiality of any
and all such material shall be maintained.   (c) The parties hereto
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, neither Buyer nor the Company would enter into this
Agreement.   8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval, but,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires
further approval by such stockholders without such further approval (unless

the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party hereto. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.   ARTICLE IX   INDEMNIFICATION   9.1 Survival of
Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties set forth
in Article IV shall survive for a period of 12 months after the Effective
Time; provided, however, that if a notice is given as provided herein before
expiration of the representation or warranty, then notwithstanding the
expiration thereof any claim based on such representation or warranty
shall survive until the resolution of such claim.   9.2 Indemnification by
Buyer. (a) Buyer agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, to indemnify the Noteholders (and Noteholders\' directors,
officers, employees, controlling persons, affiliates, successors, assigns,
representatives, advisors and legal counsel (collectively, the "NOTEHOLDER
INDEMNITEES")) against, and hold them harmless from, any Adverse Consequences
of the Noteholders related to or arising out of (i) as of the date hereof or
the Closing Date, the breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer,
Merger Sub and OpCo contained in Section 4.2 hereof or (ii) the failure by
the Buyer, Merger Sub or OpCo to perform any of its covenants or
obligations hereunder or contained in this Agreement.   (b) No claim may be
made after the Closing Date against Buyer for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) unless the aggregate of all Adverse Consequences of the
Noteholders (exclusive of legal fees incurred in connection with pursuing
such claim) with respect to Section 9.2(a) shall in the aggregate exceed
$10,000; provided, however, THAT ANY LIABILITY OF BUYER UNDER ARTICLE III OR
SECTIONS 4.2(j) OR 6.7 OR 6.18 SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO SUCH LIMITATIONS; AND
PROVIDED, FURTHER that under no circumstances shall liability of Buyer under
Section 9.2(a) exceed $10,000,000. This Section 9.2 is not intended to
address the liability of Buyer for any breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant if the Merger is not consummated.     56    (c) The
Noteholder Indemnitees agree to give Buyer through the Noteholder
Representative prompt written notice of any claim, assertion, event or
proceeding by or in respect of a third party of which they have
knowledge concerning any liability or damage as to which they may request
indemnification hereunder (a "CLAIM NOTICE" which contains (a) a description
and the amount (the "CLAIM AMOUNT") of such indemnification request, and (b)
a statement that the Noteholder Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
hereunder and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor (a copy of such
Claim Notice shall also be delivered to the Escrow Agent)); provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Noteholder Representative in
notifying Buyer shall relieve Buyer from any liability or obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) Buyer can demonstrate
that it was damaged by such delay. Buyer will not consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to the matter, or enter into any settlement which does
not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter
releases the Noteholder Indemnitees from all liability with respect thereto
without the written consent of the Noteholder Representative which will not
be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall have the right to direct, at its own
expense and through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of
any such claim or proceeding. The Noteholder Representative shall provide
Buyer with access to all records and personnel of the Noteholder Indemnitees
and the Company relating to any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding
during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist,
at Buyer\'s request, Buyer in the defense or settlement thereof, and Buyer
shall reimburse the Noteholder Representative for all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses in connection therewith. If Buyer elects to direct the
defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Noteholder Representative shall
not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from
such asserted liability unless Buyer consents in writing to such payment or
unless Buyer, subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.2(c), withdraws
from the defense of such asserted liability or unless a final judgment from
which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Noteholders\' Indemnitees
or Buyer is entered against the Noteholder Representative for such liability.
If Buyer shall fail to assume the defense of such claim in the
manner provided above, or if, after commencing or undertaking any such
defense, fails to prosecute diligently or withdraws from such defense, the
Noteholder Representative shall have the right to undertake the defense or
settlement thereof, and the Noteholder Representative may defend against, or
enter into any settlement with respect to, the matter in any manner the
Noteholder Representative reasonably may deem appropriate.   (d) The
indemnification obligations of the Buyer under this Section 9.2 constitute
and shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy of the Noteholder
Indemnitees against the Buyer for any Adverse Consequences arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect to
any breach by the Buyer of any representation, warranty or covenant
hereunder; provided, however, nothing in this Section 9.2(d) shall limit any
equitable remedy, including injunction, that Noteholder Indemnitees may have
pursuant to this Agreement.   9.3 Indemnification by the Noteholders. (a)
The Escrow Noteholders, jointly and severally, agree, subject to the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to indemnify
Buyer (and Buyer\'s directors, officers, employees, controlling persons,
affiliates, successors, assigns, representatives, advisors and legal counsel
(collectively, the "BUYER INDEMNITEES")) against, and hold them harmless
from, any Adverse Consequences of the Buyer related to or arising out of (i)
as of the date hereof or on the Closing Date, the breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company or the Noteholders contained in
this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule (without regard to any
"materiality", "Company Material Adverse Effect", "substantial compliance" or
similar exception or qualifier solely for the purpose of determining the
amount of any Adverse Consequences) (or in any certificate delivered by the
Company under this Agreement) or the failure by the Company or any Noteholder
(including FS Private pursuant to Section 6.13) to perform any of its
covenants or obligations hereunder or contained in this Agreement or the
Company Disclosure Schedule (or in any certificate or financial statements
delivered by the Company or the Noteholders under this Agreement), (ii)
any     57   Company Contract with a Governmental Entity that may not
be terminated by the Governmental Entity on notice of 90 days or less, due to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the loss of net profit that the Company would
have otherwise recognized but for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) any brokers\' commissions,
finders\' fees or other like payments incurred or alleged to have been
incurred by the Company or Noteholders in connection with the Merger or the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement other
than the payment of $750,000 to ThinkEquity for the performance of services
referred to in Section 4.1(x) of this Agreement. The Noteholders agree to
establish the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 9.3(c) for the purpose
of securing the Noteholders\' indemnification obligations hereunder.   (b)
If any Buyer Indemnitee receives any insurance proceeds after the Noteholders
shall have made any payment to such Buyer Indemnitee with respect to Adverse
Consequences, such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly remit such payment to the
Noteholder Representative to the extent of such insurance proceeds received.
Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, make appropriate claims in good faith under its insurance
policies, if any, covering any liability for which the Noteholders
are providing any indemnity under this Article IX and use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect on such claims.   (c) Except as with respect
to a claim for Taxes under Section 6.16 or a breach of a representation or
warranty in Section 4.1(f), no claim may be made after the Closing Date
against the Escrow Fund for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a) unless
(i) the aggregate Adverse Consequences of such claim (or series of related
claims) shall in the aggregate exceed $10,000 and (ii) the aggregate of all
Adverse Consequences of the Buyer (exclusive of legal fees incurred in
connection with pursuing such claim) with respect to Section 9.3(a) shall in
the aggregate exceed $300,000. The maximum amount of any payments for Adverse
Consequences (including indemnification payments required to be made to Buyer
Indemnitees under this Section 9.3) shall not exceed the value of the Escrow
Fund (as determined below). FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF
ESCROW SHARES TO BE DELIVERED TO BUYER IN PAYMENT OF ANY INDEMNIFICATION DUE
BUYER HEREUNDER, SUCH SHARES SHALL BE VALUED AT THEIR BUYER SHARE MARKET
VALUE, EXCEPT THAT THE REFERENCE TO THE DATE IN THE DEFINITION OF SUCH TERM
SHALL BE REPLACED BY THE DATE AS OF WHICH THE AMOUNT OF SUCH INDEMNIFICATION
IS FINALLY DETERMINED; PROVIDED THAT, IF AT SUCH TIME THE BUYER COMMON STOCK
IS NO LONGER LISTED ON NASDAQ, THE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE FAIR MARKET
VALUE OF SUCH SHARES SHALL BE A CUSTOMARY METHOD REASONABLY AGREED BY
THE PARTIES IN GOOD FAITH. The Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to
collect from the Company\'s applicable insurance policy that would otherwise
provide protection or reimbursement any claim of Adverse Consequences that
would otherwise be made pursuant to Section 9.3(a) unless any such effort
would result in detriment to the Buyer. The Noteholders shall not have any
right of contribution from the Company with respect to any loss claimed by
the Buyer Indemnitees after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not limit or preclude any Noteholders\' rights to seek
indemnification, contribution or advancement of expenses against the
Surviving Corporation as contemplated under Section 6.18 hereof. This Section
9.3 is not intended to address the liability of the Company or the
Noteholders for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if the
Merger is not consummated.   (d) As security (i) for the indemnity provided
for in this Section 9.3 and (ii) to satisfy the adjustments pursuant to
Section 3.5, each of the Escrow Noteholders receiving Buyer Common Stock in
pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed to have received and deposited with
the Escrow Agent the Escrow Shares (plus any additional shares as may be
issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by
Buyer after the Closing Date with respect to the Escrow Shares). The Escrow
Shares will be deposited with and will be held by the Escrow Agent, such
deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND") to be governed by
the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The portion     58   of
the Escrow Fund contributed on behalf of each Escrow Noteholder shall be
in proportion to the aggregate Buyer Common Stock which such Escrow
Noteholder would otherwise be entitled under Section 3.2. While so held by
the Escrow Agent, and subject to the sale or cancellation of the Escrow
Shares pursuant hereto, the Escrow Noteholders shall have the right to vote
their respective Escrow Shares and to receive dividends thereon, if any, but
shall not have the right to pledge, hypothecate, grant a security interest in
or otherwise transfer or encumber such Escrow Shares. The Escrow Noteholders
shall be responsible for any Taxes on any earnings or income of the Escrow
Fund. Escrow Agent shall release all Escrow Shares not sold or cancelled in
accordance with Article IX or Section 3.5 on the first anniversary of the
Effective Time and deliver such Escrow Shares to the Escrow Noteholders, pro
rata in accordance with their respective pro rata percentages of the Buyer
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, unless there is then
pending an unresolved indemnification claim in which case Escrow Shares
necessary to satisfy such claim shall be released and delivered only upon
satisfaction of such claim.   (e) The Buyer Indemnitees agree to give the
Noteholder Representative, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, prompt Claim
Notice which shall contain information similar to that described in Section
9.2(c); provided, however, that no delay on the part of any Buyer Indemnitee
in notifying the Noteholder Representative shall relieve the Noteholders from
any liability or obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent
that) the Noteholders can demonstrate that they were damaged by such delay.
The Noteholders will not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
the matter, or enter into any settlement which does not include a provision
whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases any Buyer Indemnitee
from all liability with respect thereto, without the written consent of the
Buyer Indemnitees which will not be unreasonably withheld. The Noteholders
shall have the right to direct, at their expense and through counsel of their
own choosing, the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding. The
Buyer Indemnitees shall provide the Noteholders or their representatives with
reasonable access to all records and personnel of the Company relating to any
such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours. If
the Noteholders elect to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding,
the Buyer Indemnitees shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any
claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless the Noteholder
Representative consents in writing to such payment or unless the Noteholders,
subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.3(e), withdraw from the
defense of such asserted liability or unless a final judgment from which no
appeal may be taken by or on behalf of Noteholders or the Buyer Indemnitees
is entered against the Buyer Indemnitees for such liability. If the
Noteholders shall fail to assume the defense of such claim in the
manner provided above, or if, after commencing or undertaking any such
defense, fail to prosecute diligently or withdraw from such defense, the
Buyer Indemnitees shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement
thereof, and the Buyer Indemnitees may defend against, or enter into any
settlement with respect to, the matter in any manner the Buyer Indemnitees
reasonably may deem appropriate.   (f) Indemnities with respect to Tax
matters, other than any indemnity relating to a breach by the Company of its
representations or warranties in Section 4.1(p), shall be governed and
controlled by Section 6.16 of this Agreement and not this Section 9.3.  
(g) Except with respect to any indemnification obligations of the Noteholders
pursuant to Sections 6.15 and 6.16, the indemnification obligations of the
Escrow Noteholders under this Section 9.3 constitute and shall be the sole
and exclusive right and remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees against the
Noteholders for any Adverse Consequences arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including, without limitation, with respect to any breach by any
Noteholder of any representation, warranty or covenant under this
Agreement; provided, however, nothing in this Section 9.3(g) shall limit any
equitable remedy, including injunction, that Buyer Indemnitees may have
pursuant to this Agreement.      59    9.4 Noteholder Representative;
Approval of Noteholders.   (a) FS Private shall be constituted and appointed
as agent ("NOTEHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE") for and on behalf of the Noteholders
to give and receive notices and communications, to agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and
to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Noteholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such
agency may be changed by a majority vote or by the written consent of the
majority of the Noteholders from time to time upon not less than ten Business
Days\' prior written notice to Buyer. No bond shall be required of the
Noteholder Representative, and the Noteholder Representative shall receive no
compensation for his/her services. Notices or communications to or from the
Noteholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Noteholders. The Noteholder Representative shall deliver copies of any and
all notices of communications to or from the Noteholder Representative to
each individual Noteholder at its address as provided in Section 10.1 of this
Agreement, as updated from time to time.   (b) Neither the Noteholder
Representative nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall
be liable to any Person for any error of judgment, or any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken, under this Agreement, except in the case of
its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Noteholder
Representative may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of
such counsel, accountants or experts. The Noteholder Representative shall not
have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance
of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement. As to any
matters not expressly provided for in this Agreement, the Noteholder
Representative shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action. Buyer shall be entitled to rely on all statements, representations
and decisions of the Noteholder Representative. All Expenses incurred by the
Noteholder Representative in its capacity as such in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid out of the
Escrow Fund.   (c) The approval by the Noteholders of the Merger shall
be deemed to be approval of the terms of the provisions of this Article
IX, including the appointment of the Noteholder Representative.   (d) A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Noteholder Representative shall
constitute a decision of all Noteholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Noteholder, and Buyer may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Noteholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Noteholder. Buyer
is hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by it
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Noteholder Representative.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein contained, after the Closing Date, the sole remedy of the Buyer and
the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to every matter under this Agreement shall
be as set forth in this Article IX and the sole source of satisfying such
remedy shall be the Escrow Fund.   ARTICLE X   GENERAL PROVISIONS
