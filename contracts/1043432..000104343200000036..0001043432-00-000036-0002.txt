ix     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(this "Agreement"), dated as of December 8, 2000, among MERISTAR HOTELS and
RESORTS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("MeriStar"), AMERICAN SKIING COMPANY,
a Delaware corporation ("ASC") and ASC MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASC ("Merger Sub").   
RECITALS   (a) The respective Boards of Directors of Merger Sub, MeriStar
and ASC have each determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and into
MeriStar on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth on
this Agreement, with MeriStar surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASC
(the "Merger"), is advisable and that it is in the best interest of their
respective corporations and stockholders to combine the respective businesses
of ASC and MeriStar, and consequently have approved and adopted the Merger
and this Agreement, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). The Board of Directors of ASC is acting upon
the recommendation of its Special Committee.   (b) Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, as a condition to the willingness of MeriStar to
enter into this Agreement, (i) certain holders of ASC Shares (the "Principal
ASC Stockholders") are entering into a Voting and Recapitalization Agreement,
dated the date hereof, with ASC and MeriStar (the "ASC
Voting/Recapitalization Agreement") which provides, among other things, that
(A) each Principal ASC Stockholder will vote his or its shares of ASC Common
Stock, ASC Class A Common Stock or ASC Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the ASC
Stockholders Meeting, (B) as part of a recapitalization of ASC, (x) the
shares of ASC Class A Common Stock and the shares of ASC Series B Preferred
Stock will be converted into ASC Common Stock and (y) the shares of ASC
Series A Preferred Stock will be converted into shares of ASC Common
Stock and shares of a new series of preferred stock of ASC, to be designated
Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, with terms substantially
as set forth in Exhibit B to the ASC Voting and Recapitalization Agreement
(the "New ASC Series A Preferred Stock"); (ii) certain holders of MeriStar
Common Stock (the "Principal MeriStar Stockholders") are entering into a
Voting Agreement, dated the date hereof, with ASC and MeriStar (the "MeriStar
Voting Agreement") which provides, among other things, that each Principal
MeriStar Stockholder will vote his or its shares of MeriStar Common Stock in
favor of approval and    adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the
MeriStar Stockholders Meeting; and (iii) each Principal MeriStar Stockholder
has delivered to ASC an irrevocable proxy to vote his or her shares of
MeriStar Common Stock as described in clause (ii) of this Recital (b).  
(c) For federal income tax purposes it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules
and regulations promulgated under the Code.   (d) Certain terms used in
this Agreement have the meanings specified in Section 8.1.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and
agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to
this Agreement, intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, agree as

State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of MeriStar with all
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger.   (b) At the election of ASC, any direct wholly-

corporation in the Merger. In such event, the parties agree to execute an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
substitution.   Section 1.2 Effective Time. As soon as practicable

Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, ASC shall deposit with the transfer
agent for shares of ASC Common Stock, or with such other bank or trust
company designated by ASC prior to the Effective Time and reasonably

of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the
Exchange Agent, certificates representing the number of shares of ASC Common
Stock (such shares of ASC Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto to which the holders of Certificates
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for
outstanding shares of MeriStar Common Stock.    5   (b) Exchange
Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (other than MeriStar, ASC, Merger Sub, any ASC Subsidiary or any
MeriStar Subsidiary) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery
shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu

provisions reasonably specified by ASC, and (ii) instructions
for surrendering the Certificates in exchange for (A) certificates
representing shares of ASC Common Stock, (B) cash in lieu of fractional
shares and (C) any unpaid dividends and other distributions. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of that Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange (1) a certificate representing that number of
whole shares of ASC Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive under
this Article II, (2) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required tax withholding) of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus
(y) any unpaid dividends (other than stock dividends) and any other dividends
or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive under the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of MeriStar Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of MeriStar, a certificate representing the proper number of shares
of ASC Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon the
surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in
respect of those shares, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such MeriStar Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect the transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. If any certificate for shares of ASC Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of certificates for shares of ASC Common
Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the surrendered
Certificate, or shall establish to the satisfaction of ASC or the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (c) Distributions
with Respect to Unexchanged MeriStar Common Stock. Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by ASC in respect of ASC Common Stock and the
record date for that dividend or other distribution is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable under this Agreement.
No dividends or other distributions in respect of ASC Common Stock shall be
paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until that Certificate
is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be issued or paid to the holder of the certificates representing
whole shares of ASC Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
on or prior to the date of issuance of such whole shares of ASC Common Stock
and not previously paid, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
ASC Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of ASC Common Stock, all shares of ASC
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.     6    (d) No Further Ownership
Rights in MeriStar Common Stock. Each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
certificate representing shares of ASC Common Stock and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of ASC Common Stock, as contemplated by this Section 2.2.
All shares of ASC Common Stock, together with any cash paid under Section
2.2(c) or Section 2.2(f) issued upon the surrender for or exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of MeriStar Common Stock and associated MeriStar Shareholder Rights
formerly represented by such Certificates.   (e) No Further Transfers. After
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of MeriStar shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of
MeriStar of the shares of MeriStar Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (f) Fractional Shares. No
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of ASC Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such
fractional share interest shall not entitle its owner to vote, to receive
dividends or to any other rights of a stockholder of ASC. Each holder of a
fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares
of MeriStar Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) by (B)
the closing price for a share of ASC Common Stock as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") Composite Tape as reported by the Dow Jones News
Services on the first trading day immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time occurs. As promptly as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to the holders of fractional share
interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify ASC, and ASC shall deposit such
amounts with the Exchange Agent and cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders in accordance with Section 2.2(b) and (c).    
7    (g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any shares of ASC Common Stock and
any portion of the Exchange Fund or of dividends or other distributions with
respect to ASC Common Stock deposited by ASC with the Exchange Agent
(including the proceeds of any investments of those funds) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of MeriStar 180 days after the Effective Time
shall be paid to ASC. Any former stockholders of MeriStar who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
ASC for payment of their Merger Consideration and any dividends and other
distributions issuable or payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) upon due
surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates), in each case, without any interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of ASC, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of MeriStar
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official under
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. If any Certificates
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts payable in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of ASC, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person
previously entitled to those amounts.   (h) Lost Certificates. In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of a bond in the form
customarily required by ASC as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of ASC
Common Stock, any unpaid dividends or other distributions and any cash
payment in lieu of a fractional share in respect of that Certificate issuable
or payable under this Article II upon due surrender thereof and deliverable
in respect of the shares of MeriStar Common Stock and associated MeriStar
Shareholder Rights represented by such Certificate under this Agreement, in
each case, without interest.   Section II.3 No Appraisal Rights. In
accordance with Section 262(b)(1) of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of shares of MeriStar Common Stock in connection with
the Merger.   Section 2.4 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the
event that prior to the Effective Time there is a change in the number of
shares of MeriStar Common Stock or shares of ASC Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of MeriStar Common
Stock or shares of ASC Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a
distribution, reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution or other similar transaction (other
than as contemplated by this    8   Agreement), the Exchange Ratio shall
be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of that event.   Section 2.5
Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and ASC shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of a Certificate such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provisions of Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or ASC, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of a Certificate in respect to which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or ASC, as
the case may be.   Section 2.6 MeriStar Benefit Plans.   (a) Each MeriStar
Stock Option granted under the MeriStar Option Plans that is outstanding
(whether or not then exercisable) as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the MeriStar Senior Management Options) and that has not
been exercised or canceled prior thereto, shall, to the extent provided in
such MeriStar Option Plans, at the Effective Time, vest immediately and be
converted into a vested option to purchase 1.88 shares of ASC Common Stock
for each share of MeriStar Common Stock purchasable under such MeriStar Stock
Option, at an exercise price per share of ASC Common Stock equal to (x) the
exercise price per share of MeriStar Common Stock under such MeriStar Stock
Option divided by (y) 1.88, which option shall be issued under a new ASC
stock option plan to be adopted at the Effective Time (whose terms shall be
substantially the same as those of the MeriStar Option Plan under which such
MeriStar Stock Option was issued) and evidenced by option agreements as
provided in such new plan.   (b) Each MeriStar Stock Option described in
Section 2.6(b) of the MeriStar Disclosure Letter (the "MeriStar Senior
Management Options") shall be converted into an option to purchase 1.88
shares of ASC Common Stock for each share of MeriStar Common Stock
purchasable under such MeriStar Stock Option, at an exercise price per share
of ASC Common Stock equal to (x) the exercise price per share of MeriStar
Common Stock under such MeriStar Stock Option divided by (y) 1.88, which
option shall (i) be issued under a new ASC stock option plan to be adopted at
the Effective Time (whose terms shall be substantially the same as those of
the MeriStar Option Plan under which such MeriStar Stock Option was issued),
(ii) be evidenced by option agreements as provided in such new plan and (iii)
vest on the date such MeriStar Stock Option would have vested under
the relevant MeriStar Option Plan had the Merger not occurred.    
9    (c) Each ASC Stock Option granted under the ASC Option Plan that is
outstanding (whether or not then exercisable) as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that has not been exercised or canceled prior
thereto, shall, at the Effective Time, survive the Merger and continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the
ASC Option Plan and all relevant option agreements (as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time) pursuant to which the ASC Options were
granted.   (d) As of the Effective Time, ASC shall adopt an employee stock
purchase plan whose scope, eligibility requirements and other terms
are substantially the same as those of the MeriStar Employee Stock Purchase
Plan.     ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MERISTAR

such MeriStar Subsidiary and of the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, and is in full force and effect, except to the

notice of intention to assess Taxes against MeriStar or the MeriStar
Subsidiaries, and no issue has arisen in any examination of MeriStar or the
MeriStar Subsidiaries by any taxing authority that if raised with respect to
any other period not so examined would result in a material deficiency for

adequate reserves have been established.   (j) There is no contract,

indirectly, engaging in any business currently engaged in by MeriStar, any
MeriStar Subsidiary or any other persons affiliated with MeriStar. None of
MeriStar\'s officers, directors or key employees is a party to any agreement
which, by virtue of such person\'s relationship with MeriStar, restricts in
any material respect MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary or affiliate of
either of them from, directly or indirectly, engaging in any of the

any Governmental Entity that restricts the conduct of its business, except
for any MeriStar Regulatory Agreements that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not    26   resulted and could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar or could
reasonably be expected, following consummation of the Merger, to impair
ASC\'s ability to conduct the business of the Surviving Corporation, ASC or
any ASC Subsidiary, as presently conducted. Neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar
Subsidiary has been advised by any Governmental Entity that such Governmental
Entity is considering issuing or requesting any MeriStar Regulatory

that document. Under the MeriStar Rights Agreement, none of the execution of
this Agreement, the execution of the ASC Voting/Recapitalization Agreement,

Merger and the transactions contemplated by the ASC Voting/Recapitalization
Agreement will (i) cause MeriStar Shareholder Rights to become exercisable,

affiliates and the MeriStar Financial Advisor under which the MeriStar
Financial Advisor would be entitled to any payment relating to the Merger or

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated in the Proxy Statement or necessary in order to make

respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act.   Section 3.24 Vote

as individually, or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar. Following the effective time of
the MeriStar-REIT Agreement Amendments, (i) the "MeriStar Properties" shall
not include those properties that, because of the MeriStar-REIT Agreement
Amendments, are no longer leased but are instead managed by MeriStar and (ii)
the "MeriStar Leases" (as defined below) shall no longer include MeriStar\'s
leases of such properties.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.25(b) of
the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, and except for matters which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on MeriStar or to materially and adversely affect the use or
occupancy (or, if applicable, any proposed developments) of the MeriStar
Properties in a manner which would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on MeriStar, MeriStar has no knowledge that any currently
required certificate, permit or license (including building permits and
certificates of occupancy) from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction
over any MeriStar Property (to the extent MeriStar has responsibility for
such certificate, permit or license under the applicable MeriStar Lease) has
not been obtained or is not in full force and effect or is subject to any
pending modification or cancellation.   (c) Section 3.25(c) of the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list of all definitive
agreements made or entered into by MeriStar or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, (x) to sell, mortgage, pledge or hypothecate the interest of

individually or in the aggregate, are material, or to otherwise enter into a
material transaction in respect of the ownership or financing of the interest
of MeriStar or such MeriStar Subsidiary in any MeriStar Property and (y) to
purchase real property to which MeriStar or any Subsidiary is a party.  
(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.25(d) of the MeriStar Disclosure Letter,
none of MeriStar\'s fee or leasehold interests in any of the MeriStar
Properties is subject to any outstanding purchase options, rights of first
refusal, rights of first offer or similar rights, other than such
rights which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on MeriStar, nor has MeriStar or any of its Subsidiaries entered into
any outstanding contracts with others for the sale, mortgage, pledge,
hypothecation, assignment, sublease or lease of any material portion of the
MeriStar Property or MeriStar\'s interest therein or other transfer of all or
any part of any MeriStar Property or MeriStar\'s interest therein, except for

long-term stay rental units, newsstands, gift shops, restaurants and other
establishments    29   customarily located in hotel properties, (ii)
leases and subleases of rooftops and other portions of the MeriStar
Properties for telecommunications purposes and (iii) other leases, subleases
and similar agreements the existence of which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar
(collectively, "MeriStar Ordinary Course Leases").   (e) The leases
underlying the leased MeriStar Properties referenced in Section 3.25(a)(i) of
the MeriStar Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "MeriStar Leases") are
accurately set forth in Section 3.25(e) of the MeriStar Disclosure Letter.
Each of the MeriStar Leases is valid, binding and in full force and effect as
against MeriStar or its Subsidiaries and, to MeriStar\'s knowledge, as
against the other party thereto, except to the extent the failure to be
binding and in full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar. There does not exist under any of the
MeriStar Leases any default or event of default, and, to MeriStar\'s
knowledge, no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute such a default or event of default, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar.   (f) Section 3.25(f) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of the hotel franchise agreements (the

of the MeriStar Franchise Agreements is valid, binding and in full force and
effect (except to the extent the failure to be binding and in full force and
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar). There are no defaults under
the MeriStar Franchise Agreements by MeriStar or, to the knowledge of
MeriStar, by any other party thereto, nor have any events occurred which with
the giving notice or the passage of time or both would constitute such a
default or event of default thereunder, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar.   (g) Section
3.25(g) of the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets forth all material leases,
subleases, licenses, time-share and other agreements, other than MeriStar
Ordinary Course Leases (collectively, the "MeriStar Space Leases"), granting
to any person or entity other than MeriStar any right to the possession, use,
occupancy or enjoyment of the MeriStar Properties or any portion thereof.
Each MeriStar Space Lease is valid, binding and in full force and effect, all
rent and other sums and charges payable by the tenant or occupant thereunder
(a "MeriStar Space Tenant") are current, no notice of default or termination
under any MeriStar Space Lease is outstanding, no termination event or
condition or uncured default on the part of MeriStar or, to the knowledge of
MeriStar, the MeriStar Space Tenant, exists under any MeriStar Space Lease,
and no event has occurred and no condition exists that, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute such a default or
termination event or condition, except where such default, termination,   
30   termination event, condition or failure to be valid, binding and in
full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
MeriStar.   (h) MeriStar or the MeriStar Subsidiaries owns or own, as
the case may be, good and valid title to all of its material tangible
property and assets (other than the MeriStar Properties) used in, held for
use in or which are necessary for the conduct of the business of MeriStar as
currently conducted, except where the failure to hold good and valid title to
such property and assets, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
MeriStar.   (i) MeriStar has not received notice of and, to the
knowledge of MeriStar, there is no pending, threatened or contemplated
condemnation proceeding affecting the MeriStar Property or any part thereof,
nor any sale or other disposition of the MeriStar Property or any part
thereof in lieu of condemnation. No portion of the MeriStar Property has
suffered any material damage by fire or other casualty that has not
heretofore been completely repaired and restored, except as, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar.   (j) MeriStar has made available to
ASC or its representatives copies of the MeriStar Leases and the MeriStar
Space Leases that are true, correct and complete in all material
respects.   (k) Neither MeriStar nor any of the MeriStar Subsidiaries
is engaged in any real estate development projects except as set forth in
Section 3.25(k) of the MeriStar Disclosure Letter.   (l) For purposes of
the representations and warranties of MeriStar relating to the MeriStar
Properties, a "Material Adverse Effect on MeriStar" shall not include any
effect on MeriStar arising from the entering into and performance in
accordance with the terms of the MeriStar-REIT Agreement Amendments and
associated agreements, provided that the MeriStar-REIT Agreement Amendments
and associated agreements are in compliance with the requirements set forth
in Section 5.10(f) of the MeriStar Disclosure Letter; and provided
further that any effect on MeriStar resulting from the failure of the
MeriStar-REIT Amendments to be performed in accordance with the terms thereof
may be considered in determining whether there has been a Material Adverse
Effect on MeriStar. Following the effective time of the MeriStar-REIT
Agreement Amendments, each management or other similar contract resulting
from the MeriStar-REIT Agreement Amendments with respect to each of the
properties subject to the MeriStar-REIT Agreement Amendments shall be deemed
to be set forth in Section 3.12 of the MeriStar Disclosure Letter.

the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, there is no employment or severance contract
or other agreement requiring payments, cancellation of indebtedness or
other obligation to be made upon a change of control of MeriStar or any

with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any
existing default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default) that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had and could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on ASC.     51    (b) Except as set forth in

valid title to all of its other material tangible properties and assets,
real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in, or which are necessary to

under the ASC Senior Credit Facility, the Resorts Credit Facility, the
Textron Facility or the ASC Subordinated Loan Facility and (ii) Encumbrances
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or could reasonably not
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ASC. For purposes of the

the "Improvements"), are included in the Owned Real Property, the U.S.
Forest Service Properties and the Leased Real Property or property leased by
ASC or the ASC Subsidiaries under leases with annual payments of less than
$50,000 (collectively, the "Real Property").   (e) Section 4.25(e) of the
ASC Disclosure Letter sets forth all material leases, subleases, licenses,
time-share and other agreements (collectively, the "Space Leases") granting
to any person or entity other than ASC or any ASC Subsidiary any right to the
possession, use, occupancy or enjoyment of the Real Property or any portion
thereof other than in an Interval (as defined below). Each Space Lease is
valid, binding and in full force and effect, all rent and other sums and
charges payable by the tenant or occupant thereunder (the "Space Tenant") are
current, no notice of default or termination under any Space Lease is
outstanding, no termination event or condition or uncured default on the part
of ASC or any ASC Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of ASC, the Space Tenant,
exists under any Space Lease, and no event has occurred and no condition
exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would
constitute such a default or termination event or condition, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ASC.   52    (f) To the
knowledge of ASC, all components of all Improvements are in good operating
condition and repair, subject to continued repair and replacement in
accordance with past practice, except as, individually or in the aggregate,

Effect on ASC.   (g) Neither ASC nor any ASC Subsidiary has received notice
of and, to the knowledge of ASC, there is no pending, threatened or

ASC Disclosure Letter or as except as, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on ASC. ASC and the ASC Subsidiaries are in possession of all ASC
Permits necessary for the completion of the Development Activities which are

reason to believe that it will not be able to obtain any other ASC Permit
necessary for the performance and completion of the Development Activities,
except where the failure to obtain such ASC Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on ASC.   (i) Except as set forth in Section 4.25(i) of the ASC Disclosure
Letter, the land for each Development Activity at each Resort (as defined
below) has been zoned for its intended use in accordance with its Project
Plan and applicable law and all requirements for that zoning have been met

a Material Adverse Effect on ASC. Except as set forth in Section 4.25(i) of
the ASC Disclosure Letter, the land for each Development Activity has
been subdivided for its intended use in accordance with its Project Plan and
each subdivided plot constitutes its own separate tax lot, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ASC. Except as set forth in
Section 4.25(i) of the ASC Disclosure Letter, all material archeological,
soil, geotechnical, traffic,    53   environmental and similar studies
necessary in connection with the Development Activities have been completed
and to the knowledge of ASC reveal no facts or conditions which, individually
or in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Development Activities.   (j) Except as set
forth in Section 4.25(j) of the ASC Disclosure Letter, no Governmental Entity
or board has requested (and continues to request) or required (or, to the
knowledge of ASC, is expected to require in order to obtain future approvals)
that additional material public or quasi-public facilities be constructed or
material monies or property be contributed as a condition to the Development
Activities or in connection with any Resort ("Development Fees"). Except as
set forth in Section 4.25(j) of the ASC Disclosure Letter, there are no
payments, material performance bonds, letters of credit or completion
guarantees for the benefit of any governmental agency which are currently
outstanding or which will be required to be funded within the next five years
in relation to the Development Activities.   (k) To the knowledge of ASC,
Section 4.25(k) of the ASC Disclosure Letter lists all material regulatory
processes necessary to (i) complete the Development Activities as

Activities to full entitlement status.   (l) To the knowledge of ASC,

ASC or the ASC Subsidiaries under the Textron Facility and the
ASC Subordinated Loan Facility to complete such construction.   (n) ASC has

rental management sources other than ASC or any ASC Subsidiary, in each case,

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ASC.   (c)
Except as set forth in Section 4.26(c) of the ASC Disclosure Letter, to the
knowledge of ASC, there exist no facts giving rise to any right of consumer
rescission with regard to any contract to sell or closed sale of any Interval
or Unit, whether because of non-compliance with one or more state or federal
statutes creating rescission rights in consumers under specified
circumstances, or because of specific facts constituting misrepresentation or
fraud with respect to any Prospective Purchaser, in each case, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ASC.   (d) Except as set forth
in Section 4.26(d) of the ASC Disclosure Letter, there exists no Encumbrance
against any Unit or Interval or all or any portion of any Resort (including
recreational activities located within such Resort), except for Encumbrances

Killington, Vermont; (4) Mount Snow, Vermont; (5) Attitash/Bear Peak, New
Hampshire; (6) Jordan Bowl, Maine; and (7) Heavenly, California; (ii) the

All Units, amenities and recreational facilities within the Resorts that were
promised to be available for use by Prospective Purchasers were in all
material respects complete and available for legal occupancy or use prior to
the time that closing of any contracts were completed for any Intervals or
Units except as have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on ASC. Each Purchaser has dedicated free and
clear access to the use of all amenities and recreational facilities in
accordance with the Resort Documents.   (g) To the knowledge of ASC, all
owners\' associations and management companies at the Resorts are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and
local statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations requiring the full and
timely payment in all material respects of all common expenses and real
estate taxes attributable to the Resorts except as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ASC.   (h) (i)
All utilities, including sewer, water, gas, electricity, steam and telephone,
necessary for the operation of the Resorts are currently available and in
place in sufficient capacity at the Resorts to allow the immediate and full
operation in all material respects of the Resorts with the exception of the
Resorts currently under construction or where construction has not yet
commenced; (ii) to the knowledge of ASC, there are no pending or threatened
moratoria, injunctions or court orders in effect which would be reasonably

which it is incorporated except as has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on ASC.   (j) The managing
entity for the Resorts ("Managing Entity") has the authority to levy annual
assessments to cover the costs of maintaining and operating each Resort. Each
Managing Entity is solvent, and currently levied assessments on Purchasers
are adequate to cover the costs of maintaining and    56   operating the
Resort and to establish and maintain a reasonable reserve for deferred
maintenance and capital improvements. There are no events which currently
exist or could reasonably be foreseen by ASC which could give rise to a
material increase in such costs. ASC has paid all developer subsidies
in connection with the Resorts owing as of the Effective Date, including
annual maintenance fees relating to the Units, any operating expenses
relating to the Resort\'s clubhouse and amenities, and any amounts which ASC
should, or is obligated to, contribute to the reserves of the Resort\'s

MeriStar, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning ASC or

Merger; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of MeriStar may, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, withdraw, modify or change any such
recommendation if the Board of Directors of MeriStar determines in good faith
that failure to so withdraw, modify or change its recommendation would cause

independent legal counsel). In addition, the Proxy Statement and the Proxy
Materials will include a copy of the written opinion of the MeriStar
Financial Advisor referred to in Section 3.20.   (2) The Proxy Statement

Directors of ASC determines in good faith that failure to so withdraw, modify
or change its recommendation would cause the Board of Directors of ASC to
breach its fiduciary duties to ASC\'s stockholders under applicable Laws
after receipt of advice from its outside advisors (which may be ASC\'s
independent legal counsel). In addition, the Proxy Statement and the Proxy
Materials will include a copy of the written opinion of the ASC Financial
Advisor referred to in Section 4.19.   (c) No amendment or supplement to the

SEC for additional information.   (d) The information supplied by MeriStar
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the time the
Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the Proxy
Materials (or any amendment of or supplement to the Proxy Materials) is first
mailed to the stockholders of each of ASC and MeriStar, (iii) the time of
MeriStar Stockholders Meeting, and (iv) the time of ASC Stockholders Meeting,

supplement to the Proxy Statement, MeriStar shall promptly inform ASC. All

set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, ASC shall
promptly inform MeriStar. All documents that ASC is responsible for filing in

agents or otherwise) to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
MeriStar Proposals and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the Requisite MeriStar Vote, except to the extent that the Board of
Directors of MeriStar determines in good faith that    66   doing so

to MeriStar\'s stockholders under applicable Law, after receipt of advice to
such effect from independent legal counsel (which may be MeriStar\'s
regularly engaged independent legal counsel).   (b) ASC shall call and hold

of advice to such effect from independent legal counsel (which may be ASC\'s
regularly engaged independent legal counsel).   Section 5.7 Access to
Information; Confidentiality.   (a) Except as required under any

or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to MeriStar
or the MeriStar Subsidiaries, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any MeriStar Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that prior to the MeriStar Stockholders Meeting, to the extent required by
the duties of the Board of Directors of MeriStar under applicable Law, as
determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof
after consultation with and receipt of advice from outside counsel (which may
be MeriStar\'s regularly engaged independent legal counsel), MeriStar may, in
response to unsolicited requests therefor, participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish information pursuant to an appropriate

recommendation of the Board of Directors of MeriStar, or any committee
thereof, of this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or

judgment of a majority of such disinterested members (after consultation with
independent financial advisors), is reasonably capable of being financed by
such third party.   (c) MeriStar shall promptly advise ASC orally and in
writing of any MeriStar Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to

agreement to be entered into with, any person making a MeriStar Acquisition
Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.8 will
prohibit MeriStar from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to MeriStar\'s stockholders if the Board of Directors
of MeriStar determines that such disclosure is necessary in order to comply

be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. ASC

regulations of any domestic or foreign government or governmental authority

in connection with the receipt of any regulatory approval, to proffer to, or
agree to (A) sell or hold separate and agree to sell, divest or to
discontinue or limit, before or after the Effective Time, any assets,
businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of ASC, MeriStar or any

sell, or discontinuance or limitation by ASC or MeriStar, as the case may be,
of any of its assets or businesses) or (B) agree to any conditions relating
to, or changes or restriction in, the operations of any such asset or

materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to such
party of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 5.15

not, without the prior written consent of the parties to this Agreement,
knowingly take any actions or cause any actions to be taken which could
prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, and consistent

affiliates shall knowingly take any action or knowingly cause any action to
be taken which would cause the Merger to fail to so qualify as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.   Section 5.16 Public
Announcements. ASC and MeriStar shall consult with each other before issuing

transactions.   Section 5.20 Dividends. MeriStar and ASC shall
coordinate with each other with respect to the declaration, setting of record

this Agreement.   Section 8.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except
as provided in Section 5.10 this Agreement is not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties to this Agreement any rights or remedies
under this Agreement.   Section 8.8 Amendment. This Agreement may be
amended by the parties to this Agreement by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
provided that, after the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of
MeriStar or ASC, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or
change the type of consideration into which each share of MeriStar Common

consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties to this Agreement.   Section

Agreement may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other party to this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracy in

any agreement or condition contained in this Agreement. Any waiver of
a condition set forth in Section 6.1, or any determination that such a
condition has been satisfied, will be effective only if made in writing by
each of MeriStar and ASC and, unless otherwise specified in such writing,
shall thereafter operate as a waiver (or satisfaction) of such conditions for
any and all purposes of this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties
to be bound thereby.   Section 8.10 Obligations of ASC and of MeriStar.
Whenever this Agreement requires an ASC Subsidiary to take any action, that
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of ASC to
cause that ASC Subsidiary to take that action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a MeriStar Subsidiary to take any action, that requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of MeriStar to cause that
MeriStar Subsidiary to take that action and, after the Effective Time, on the
part of the Surviving Corporation to cause that MeriStar Subsidiary to take
that action.     91    Section 8.11 Severability. The provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability or the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of the provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of the provision, or
the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction.   Section
8.12 Interpretation. The table of contents and headings in this Agreement are
for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section,
exhibit or annex, that reference shall be to a Section of or exhibit or annex
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.   Section 8.13 Assignment.

except that pursuant to Section 1.1(b) ASC may designate, by written notice
to MeriStar, an ASC Subsidiary that is wholly owned directly or indirectly by
ASC to be merged with and into MeriStar in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event
all references in this Agreement to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such ASC Subsidiary, and in that case, all representations and warranties
made in this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such ASC Subsidiary as of the date of such designation.   Section 8.14
Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
reached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation and except as otherwise

Directors may from time to time determine.   FIFTH: The incorporator of the
corporation is Foster A. Stewart, Jr., whose mailing address is c/o American
Skiing Company, Sunday River Road, Bethel, Maine 04217.   SIXTH: Unless and
except to the extent that the Bylaws of the corporation shall so require, the
election of directors of the corporation need not be by written
ballot.      SEVENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the
corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter and repeal the Bylaws of
the corporation, subject to the power of the stockholders of the corporation
to alter or repeal any Bylaw whether adopted by them or otherwise.  
EIGHTH: Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation,
the corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to
amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of
Incorporation, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of
Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of
whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in
its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the rights
reserved in this article.   NINTH: The business and affairs of the
corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors. The number of directors of the corporation shall be as from time
to time fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the Bylaws of the
corporation. The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated
Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may
be possible, of one-third the total number of directors constituting the
entire Board of Directors. The term of the initial Class I directors shall
terminate on the date of the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of
the initial Class II directors shall terminate on the date of the 2002 annual
meeting of stockholders and the term of the initial Class III directors shall
terminate on the date of the 2003 annual meeting of stockholders. At each
annual meeting of stockholders beginning in 2001, successors to the class of
directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a
three year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or
decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number
of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional
directors of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase
in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the
remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of
directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall
hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires
and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however,
to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from
office. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors, however resulting, may be
filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a
vacancy shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the term of the
class to which such director shall have been elected.   Subject to the
rights of the holders of any series of Serial Preferred Stock to elect
additional directors under specified circumstances, any director may be
removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66? percent of all votes
entitled to be cast by all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of
the corporation in an election of directors at an annual meeting or at a
special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of removing such
director.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any
one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the corporation
shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term
of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships
shall be governed by the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation or the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to
Article Fourth applicable thereto.   TENTH: Meetings of stockholders of the
corporation may be held at such place, either within or outside the State of
Delaware as may be designated by or in the manner provided in the Bylaws. Any
action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders may be taken only upon the vote of the stockholders at an annual
or special meeting duly noticed and called, as provided in the Bylaws of the
corporation, and may not be taken by a written consent of the stockholders
pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law. Special meetings of
stockholders of the corporation may be called at any time only by the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Vice Chairman of the Board of
Directors, the Secretary of the Board, by the Chief Executive Officer or by a
majority of the directors, and any power of stockholders to call a special
meeting is specifically denied. Business transacted at any special meeting of
stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes
stated in the notice of meeting.   ELEVENTH: Personal Liability of Directors
or Officers.  (1) Limitation. No director of the corporation shall be
personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that this provision
shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (a) for any breach
of the director\'s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders,
(b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law or (d) for any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit.     (2) Indemnification
and Advance of Expenses. To the extent not prohibited by law, the corporation
shall indemnify any person who is or was made, or threatened to be made, a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (a
"Proceeding"), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
including, without limitation, an action by or in the right of the
corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact
that such person, or a person of whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was as a director or officer of the corporation, or, at
the request of the corporation, is or was serving as a director or officer of
any other corporation or in a capacity with comparable authority or
responsibilities for any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise (an "Other Entity"), against judgments, fines,
penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid in settlement and costs, charges and
expenses (including attorneys\' fees, disbursements and other charges).
Persons who are not directors or officers of the corporation (or otherwise
entitled to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence) may be
similarly indemnified in respect of service to the corporation or to an Other
Entity at the request of the corporation to the extent the corporation
determines to provide such indemnification.   The corporation shall
reimburse or advance to any director or officer or other person entitled to
indemnification hereunder the funds necessary for payment of expenses,
including attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Proceeding, in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding; provided,
however, that, if required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, such
expenses incurred by or on behalf of any director or officer or other person
may be paid in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding only upon
receipt by the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such
director or officer (or other person indemnified hereunder), to repay any
such amount so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by
final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal that
such director, officer or other person is not entitled to be indemnified for
such expenses.   (3) Rights Not Exclusive. The rights to indemnification
and reimbursement or advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article Eleventh shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which a person seeking indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of
expenses may have or hereafter be entitled under any statute, the Certificate
of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.   (4) Insurance. The corporation shall have power to purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of an
Other Entity, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred
by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person\'s status
as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify
such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article
Eleventh, the Certificate of Incorporation or under Section 145 of the
General Corporation Law or any other provision of law.      (5) Binding
Effect. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
conferred in this Article Eleventh shall be contract rights and such rights
shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee\'s heirs,
executors, and administrators. No repeal or modification of this Article
Eleventh shall affect any rights or obligations with respect to any state of
facts then or theretofore existing or thereafter arising or any proceeding
theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part
upon any such state of facts.   (6) Procedural Rights. The rights to
indemnification and reimbursement or advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article Eleventh shall be enforceable by any person
entitled to such indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses
in any court of competent jurisdiction. The burden of proving that such
indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses is not
appropriate shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the
corporation (including its directors, its independent legal counsel and its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that such indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of
expenses is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the
corporation (including its directors, its independent legal counsel and its
stockholders) that such person is not entitled to such indemnification or
reimbursement or advancement of expenses shall constitute a defense to the
action or create a presumption that such person is not so entitled. Such a
person shall also be indemnified for any expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his or her right to such indemnification or
reimbursement or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in any such
proceeding.   (7) Service Deemed at Corporation\'s Request. Any director or
officer of the Corporation serving in any capacity (a) another corporation of
which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its
directors is held, directly or indirectly, by the corporation or (b) any
employee benefit plan of the corporation or any corporation referred to in
clause (a) shall be deemed to be doing so at the request of the
corporation.   TWELFTH: Amendments.   (1) Certificate of Incorporation.
The affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66? percent of all votes
entitled to be cast by all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of
the corporation in an election of directors shall be required to amend,
repeal, or adopt any amendment to Article Ninth, Article Eleventh, Article
Thirteenth or this Article Twelfth of this Certificate of
Incorporation.      (2) Bylaws. The Bylaws may be altered or repealed and
new Bylaws may be adopted (i) at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders, by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of all
votes entitled to be cast by all of the then outstanding shares of capital
stock of the corporation in the election of directors, provided, however,
that any proposed alteration or repeal of, or the adoption of ay bylaw
inconsistent with, Sections 2.3, 2.13 or 2.14 of Article 2 of the Bylaws, or

to clause (c) of this Section 2, on any date prior to the Restriction
Termination Date, one or more Covered Persons who or which Beneficially Own
outstanding shares of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock in excess of 34.9% of the
total outstanding shares of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock may not Beneficially
Own Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit;   (b) Subject to clause (c) of
this Section 2, until the Restriction Termination Date, any Transfer that, if
effective, would result in one or more Covered Persons, who or which
Beneficially Own outstanding shares of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock in excess
of 34.9% of the total outstanding shares of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock,
Beneficially Owning Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit shall be void ab
initio as to the Transfer of such Shares that would otherwise be Beneficially
Owned by any Covered Person or Persons as a result of such Transfer and would
result in one or more Covered Persons Beneficially Owning Shares in excess of
the Ownership Limit and the intended transferee or transferees shall acquire
no rights in such Shares; and   (c) Nothing contained in this Article
Thirteenth shall preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into
through the facilities of the Exchange. The fact that the settlement of any
transaction occurs shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this
Article Thirteenth and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject
to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in this Article
Thirteenth.   (3) Excess Shares.   (a) If, notwithstanding the other
provisions contained in this Article Thirteenth, at any time prior to the
Restriction Termination Date, there is a purported Transfer such that one or
more Covered Persons, who or which Beneficially Own outstanding shares of
MeriStar REIT Equity Stock in excess of 34.9% of the total outstanding shares
of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock, would Beneficially Own Shares in excess of the
Ownership Limit (a "Prohibited Transfer"), then Shares Beneficially Owned by
the Covered Person or Persons who or which would otherwise be the Beneficial
Owner of Shares as a result of the    Prohibited Transfer shall be
automatically designated as Excess Shares (without reclassification) until no
one or more Covered Persons, who or which Beneficially Own outstanding shares
of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock in excess of 34.9% of the total outstanding
shares of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock, Beneficially Own Shares in excess of
the Ownership Limit. The designation of such Shares as Excess Shares shall be
effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date
of the purported Transfer. If, after designation of such Shares owned
directly by a Covered Person as Excess Shares, one or more Covered Persons
still Beneficially Own Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit, Shares
Beneficially Owned constructively by such Covered Person as a result of the
Prohibited Transfer shall be designated as Excess Shares until no one or more
Covered Person or Persons, who or which Beneficially Own outstanding shares
of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock in excess of 34.9% of the total outstanding
shares of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock, Beneficially Own Shares in excess of
the Ownership Limit. Where a Covered Person Beneficially Owns
Shares constructively through one or more Persons and the Shares held by such
other Persons must be designated as Excess Shares, the designation of Shares
held by such other Persons as Excess Shares shall be pro rata.   (b) If, at
any time prior to the Restriction Termination Date, an event other than a
purported Transfer (an "Event") occurs as a result of which one or more
Covered Persons, who or which Beneficially Own outstanding shares of MeriStar
REIT Equity Stock in excess of 34.9% of the total outstanding shares
of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock, would Beneficially Own Shares in excess of
the Ownership Limit (a "Prohibited Event"), then Shares Beneficially Owned by
each such Covered Person who or which would be otherwise the Beneficial Owner
of Shares as a result of the Prohibited Event shall be automatically
designated as Excess Shares to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess
ownership. The designation of Shares as Excess Shares shall be effective as
of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the Event.
In determining which Shares are designated as Excess Shares, Shares
Beneficially Owned by any Covered Person who caused the Event to occur shall
be designated as Excess Shares before any Shares not so held are designated.
Where several similarly situated Covered Persons exist, the designation of
Shares as Excess Shares shall be pro rata. If Shares held by any Covered
Person are required to be designated as Excess Shares pursuant to this clause
(b) of this Section 3 of this Article Thirteenth, Shares beneficially held by
such Covered Person shall first be designated before Shares Beneficially
Owned constructively are designated. Where such Covered Person Beneficially
Owns Shares constructively through one or more Persons and the Shares held by
such other Persons must be designated as Excess Shares, the designation of
Shares held by such other Persons as Excess Shares shall be pro rata.   (4)
Prevention of Transfer.   If the Board of Directors or its designee shall at
any time determine in good faith that a Transfer has taken place in violation
of Section 2 of this Article Thirteenth or that a Person intends to acquire
or has attempted to acquire Beneficial Ownership (determined without
reference to any rules of attribution) of any Shares in violation of Section
2 of this Article Thirteenth, the Board of Directors or its designee shall
take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to
prevent such Transfer, including, but not limited to, refusing to give effect
to such Transfer on the books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings
to enjoin such Transfer; provided, however, that any Transfers or attempted
Transfers in violation of Section 2 of this Article Thirteenth shall
automatically result in the designation and treatment described in Section 3
of this Article Thirteenth, irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the
Board of Directors.      (5) Notice to Corporation.   Any Person who
acquires or attempts to acquire Shares in violation of Section 2 of this
Article Thirteenth, or any Covered Person who is a transferee such that
Excess Shares result under Section 3 of this Article, shall immediately give
written notice or, in the event of a proposed or attempted Transfer, give at
least 15 days prior written notice, to the Corporation of such event. Such
Person shall also provide to the Corporation such other information as the
Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of
such Transfer or attempted Transfer on the status of MeriStar Hospitality
Corporation or any affiliate of MeriStar Hospitality Corporation as a REIT
and shall execute and deliver such instruments and provide such further
cooperation and assistance as the Board of Directors deems advisable to
preserve the status of MeriStar Hospitality Corporation or any affiliate of
MeriStar Hospitality Corporation as a REIT.   (6) Information for
Corporation.   Until the Restriction Termination Date, each Covered Person
who is a Beneficial Owner of Shares and each Covered Person (including the
stockholder of record) who is holding Shares for a Beneficial Owner shall
provide to the Corporation in writing such information with respect to
direct, indirect and constructive ownership of Shares as the Board of
Directors deems reasonably necessary to comply with the provisions of the
Code applicable to the status of MeriStar Hospitality Corporation or any of
its affiliates as a REIT, to determine the status of MeriStar Hospitality
Corporation or any of its affiliates as a REIT, or to comply with the
requirements of any taxing authority or governmental agency or to determine
any such compliance.   (7) Other Action by Board of Directors.   Subject
to Section 2 of this Article Thirteenth, nothing contained in this Article
Thirteenth shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to take such
other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the status of
MeriStar Hospitality Corporation or any affiliate of MeriStar
Hospitality Corporation as a REIT.      (8) Ambiguities.   In the case
of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Article
Thirteenth, including any definition contained in Section 1, the Board of
Directors shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions
of this Article Thirteenth with respect to any situation based on the facts
known to it. In the event this Article Thirteenth requires or permits
an action by the Board of Directors and the Certificate of Incorporation
fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of
Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as
such action is not contrary to the provisions of this Article Thirteenth.  
(9) Legend.   Each certificate for Shares shall bear substantially the
following legend:   The securities represented by this certificate are
subject to restrictions on ownership and transfer. This description is a
summary only, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
transfer restrictions in the Certificate of Incorporation of Doral
International, Inc. (the "Corporation"), a copy of which will be supplied
free of charge at any stockholder\'s request. Except as otherwise provided
pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, one or more
Covered Persons, who or which Beneficially Own outstanding shares of MeriStar
REIT Equity Stock in excess of 34.9% of the total outstanding shares of
MeriStar REIT Equity Stock, may not Beneficially Own outstanding shares of
the Corporation in excess of 35% of either (i) the total combined voting
power of all outstanding shares entitled to vote or (ii) the total
outstanding shares of the Corporation. Any Person who attempts or proposes
to, alone or in combination with other Persons, Beneficially Own shares of
the Corporation that would result in a violation of the above limitations
must notify the Corporation in writing at least 15 days prior to such
proposed or attempted Transfer. All capitalized terms not defined in this
legend have the meanings defined in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation, a copy of which, including the restrictions on transfer, will be
furnished to each stockholder on request and without charge. If
the restrictions on transfer are violated, the securities represented hereby
which are in excess of the above limitations will be designated and treated
as Excess Shares which will be held in trust by the Excess Share Trustee for
the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary.   Instead of the foregoing
legend, the certificate may state that the Corporation will furnish a full
statement about certain restrictions on transferability to a stockholder on
request and without charge.      (10) Severability.   If any provision
of this Article Thirteenth or any application of any such provision is
determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable by any court having
jurisdiction over the issue, the validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions shall be affected only to the extent necessary to comply with the
determination of such court.   (11) Transfer of Excess Shares.   Upon any
purported Transfer that results in Excess Shares pursuant to Section 3 of
this Article Thirteenth, such Excess Shares shall be
automatically transferred to the Excess Share Trustee, as trustee of a
special trust for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The
Corporation shall name a Charitable Beneficiary, if one does not already
exist, within five days of the discovery of any designation of any Excess
Shares; however, the failure to so name a Charitable Beneficiary shall not
affect the designation of Shares as Excess Shares or the transfer thereof to
the Excess Share Trustee. Excess Shares so held in trust shall be issued and
outstanding Shares of the Corporation. The Purported Record Transferee shall
have no rights in such Excess Shares except as expressly provided in this
Article Thirteenth.   (12) Distributions on Excess Shares.   Any dividends
(whether taxable as a dividend, return of capital or otherwise) on Excess
Shares shall be paid to the Excess Share Trust for the benefit of the
Charitable Beneficiary. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the
Purported Record Transferee shall receive, for each Excess Share, the lesser
of (1) the amount per share of any distribution made upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up and (2) the price paid by the
Purported Record Transferee for the Excess Shares, or if the Purported Record
Transferee did not give value for the Excess Shares, the Fair Market Value of
the Excess Shares on the day of the event causing the Excess Shares to be
held in trust. Any such dividend or distribution paid to the Purported Record
Transferee in excess of the amount provided in the preceding sentence prior
to the discovery by the Corporation that the Shares with respect to which the
dividend or distribution was made had been designated as Excess Shares shall
be repaid, upon demand, to the Excess Share Trust for the benefit of the
Charitable Beneficiary.      (13) Voting of Excess Shares.   The Excess
Share Trustee shall be entitled to vote the Excess Shares on behalf of the
Charitable Beneficiary on any matter. Subject to Delaware law, any vote cast
by a Purported Record Transferee with respect to the Excess Shares prior to
the discovery by the Corporation that the Excess Shares were held in trust
will be rescinded ab initio; provided, however, that if the Corporation has
already taken irreversible action with respect to a merger,
reorganization, sale of all or substantially all the assets, dissolution of
the Corporation or other action by the Corporation, then the vote cast by the
Purported Record Transferee shall not be rescinded. The owner of the Excess
Shares will be deemed to have given an irrevocable proxy to the Excess Share
Trustee to vote the Excess Shares for the benefit of the Charitable
Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article Thirteenth, until
the Corporation has received notification that Excess Shares have been
transferred into an Excess Share Trust, the Corporation shall be entitled to
rely on its share transfer and other stockholder records for purposes of
preparing lists of stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the
validity and authority of proxies and otherwise conducting votes of
stockholders.   (14) Non-Transferability of Excess Shares.   Excess Shares
shall be transferable only as provided in this Section 14. At the direction
of the Board of Directors, the Excess Share Trustee shall transfer the Shares
held in the Excess Share Trust to a Person or Persons whose ownership of such
Shares will not violate the Ownership Limit. If such a transfer is made to
such a Person or Persons, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary shall
terminate and the designation of such Shares as Excess Shares shall thereupon
cease. The Purported Record Transferee shall receive the lesser of (1) the
price paid by the Purported Record Transferee for the Excess Shares or, if
the Purported Record Transferee did not give value for the Excess Shares, the
Fair Market Value of the Excess Shares on the day of the event causing
the Excess Shares to be held in trust, and (2) the price received by the
Excess Share Trust from the sale or other disposition of the Excess Shares.
Any proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Purported Record
Transferee will be paid to the Charitable Beneficiary. The Excess Share
Trustee shall be under no obligation to obtain the highest possible price for
the Excess Shares. Prior to any transfer of any Excess Shares by the Excess
Share Trustee, the Corporation must have waived in writing its purchase
rights under Section 15. It is expressly understood that the Purported Record
Transferee may enforce the provisions of this Section 14 against the
Charitable Beneficiary.      If any of the foregoing restrictions on
transfer of Excess Shares is determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable
by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Purported Record Transferee
may be deemed, at the option of the Corporation, to have acted as an agent of
the Corporation in acquiring such Excess Shares in trust and to hold such
Excess Shares on behalf of the Corporation.   (15) Call by Corporation on
Excess Shares.   Excess Shares shall be deemed to have been offered for sale
to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price equal to the lesser of (a)
the price paid by the Purported Record Transferee for the Excess Shares or,
if the Purported Record Transferee did not give value for the Excess Shares,
the Fair Market Value of the Excess Shares on the day of the event causing
the Excess Shares to be held in trust and (b) the Fair Market Value of the
Excess Shares on the date the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such
offer (the "Redemption Price"). The Corporation shall have the right to
accept such offer for a period of ninety days after the later of (x) the date
of the purported Transfer which resulted in such Excess Shares and (y) the
date the Board of Directors determines in good faith that a purported
Transfer resulting in Excess Shares has occurred, if the Corporation does not
receive a notice of such purported Transfer pursuant to Section 5 of this
Article but in no event later than a permitted Transfer pursuant to and in
compliance with the terms of Section 14 of this Article. Unless the Board of
Directors determines that it is in the interest of the Corporation to make
earlier payments of all of the amount determined as the Redemption Price in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the Redemption Price may be payable
at the option of the Board of Directors at any time up to but not later than
the date five years after the date the Corporation accepts the offer to
purchase the Excess Shares. The Corporation shall pay interest at the
applicable federal rate under section 1274(d) of the Code, or any successor
provision, to the Purported Record Transferee.   (16) Underwritten
Offerings.   The Ownership Limit shall not apply to the acquisition of
Shares or rights, options or warrants for, or securities convertible into,
Shares by an underwriter in a public offering, provided that (i) the
underwriter makes a timely distribution of such Shares or rights, options or
warrants for, or securities convertible into, Shares and (ii) the
underwriter, alone or in combination with one or more other Covered Persons,
does not Beneficially Own outstanding shares of MeriStar REIT Equity Stock in
excess of 34.9% of the total outstanding shares of MeriStar REIT Equity
Stock.      (17) Enforcement.   The Corporation is authorized
specifically to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to
enforce the provisions of this Article Thirteenth.   (18) Non-Waiver.  
No delay or failure on the part of the Corporation or the Board of Directors
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any right of
the Corporation or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, except to the
extent specifically waived in writing.    (19) Amendment.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this certificate or the Bylaws of the
Corporation, the provisions of this Article Thirteenth shall not be amended,
altered, changed or repealed without the affirmative vote of all of
the directors of the Corporation who are not officers or employees of
the Corporation or any affiliate of the Corporation.      IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, American Skiing Company has caused this certificate to be signed on

place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be
specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place
where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present. The Corporation shall maintain
the stockholder list in written form or in another form capable of conversion
into written form within a reasonable time. Upon the willful neglect or
refusal of the Directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the
election of Directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at
such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are
the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of
stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders.   2.8 Quorum of Stockholders;
Adjournment; Order of Business. Except as otherwise provided by any statute,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the holders of one-third of
all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of any business at such meeting. When a quorum is
once present to organize a meeting of stockholders, it is not broken by the
subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders. The chair of any meeting of
stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the
meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of
discussion as seem to him or her in order. The chair shall have the power to
adjourn the meeting to another place, date and time. The date and time of the
opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders
will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting. Shares of its own
stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority
of the shares entitled to vote in the election of Directors of such other
corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation,
shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the
Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held
by it in a fiduciary capacity.      2.9 Voting; Proxies. Unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, every stockholder of
record shall be entitled at every meeting of stockholders to one vote for
each share of capital stock standing in his or her name on the record of
stockholders determined in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof. If the
Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any
share on any matter, each reference in the Bylaws or the General Corporation
Law to a majority or other proportion of stock shall refer to such majority
or other proportion of the votes of such stock. The provisions of Sections
212 and 217 of the General Corporation Law shall apply in determining whether
any shares of capital stock may be voted and the persons, if any, entitled to
vote such shares; but the Corporation shall be protected in assuming that the
persons in whose names shares of capital stock stand on the stock ledger of
the Corporation are entitled to vote such shares. Holders of redeemable
shares of stock are not entitled to vote after the notice of redemption is
mailed to such holders and a sum sufficient to redeem the stocks has been
deposited with a bank, trust company, or other financial institution under an
irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price on surrender
of the shares of stock. At any meeting of stockholders (at which a quorum was
present to organize the meeting), all matters, except as otherwise provided
by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, shall
be decided by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on any
such matter at such meeting by the holders of shares present in person
or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, whether or not a quorum
is present when the vote is taken. All elections of Directors shall be by
written ballot unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.
In voting on any other question on which a vote by ballot is required by law
or is demanded by any stockholder entitled to vote, the voting shall be by
ballot. Each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting or the
stockholder\'s proxy and shall state the number of shares voted. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize
another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. The validity
and enforceability of any proxy shall be determined in accordance with
Section 212 of the General Corporation Law. A stockholder may revoke any
proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person
or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a
proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the
Secretary.   2.10 Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Election at Meetings
of Stockholders. The Board, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, may
appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written
report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate
inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or
alternate has been appointed or is able to act at a meeting, the person
presiding at the meeting may appoint, and on the request of any stockholder
entitled to vote thereat shall appoint, one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her
duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding
and the voting power of each, (b) determine the shares represented at the
meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (c) count all votes and
ballots, (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors,
and (e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at
the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may
appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the
performance of their duties. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the date
and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon
which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the
person presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at the meeting.
No ballot, proxies or votes, or any revocation thereof or change thereto,
shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware upon application by a stockholder
shall determine otherwise.      2.11 Organization. At each meeting of
stockholders, the Chief Executive Officer, or in the absence of the Chief
Executive Officer, the Chairman, or if there is no Chairman or if there be
one and the Chairman is absent, a Vice President, and in case more than one
Vice President shall be present, that Vice President designated by the Board
(or in the absence of any such designation, the most senior Vice President,
based on age, present), shall act as chairman of the meeting. The Secretary,
or in his or her absence, one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as
secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to
act as chairman or secretary of the meeting, respectively, shall be present,
a chairman or a secretary of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be chosen
by a majority of the votes cast at such meeting by the holders of shares of
capital stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
at the meeting.   2.12 Written Consent of Stockholders. Not Permitted. Any
action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of such
holders and may not be taken by any consent in writing by such
stockholders.   2.13 Advance Notice of Stockholder Proposals. At any annual
or special meeting of stockholders, proposals by stockholders and persons
nominated for election as Directors by stockholders shall be considered only
if advance notice thereof has been timely given as provided herein and such
proposals or nominations are otherwise proper for consideration under
applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws. Notice
of any proposal to be presented by any stockholder or of the name of any
person to be nominated by any stockholder for election as a Director of the
Corporation at any meeting of stockholders shall be delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation at its principal executive office not less than
60 nor more than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting; provided, however,
that if the date of the meeting is first publicly announced or disclosed (in
a public filing or otherwise) less than 70 days prior to the date of the
meeting, such advance notice shall be given not more than ten days after such
date is first so announced or disclosed. Public notice shall be deemed to
have been given more than 70 days in advance of the annual meeting if the
Corporation shall have previously disclosed, in these Bylaws or otherwise,
that the annual meeting in each year is to be held on a determinable date,
unless and until the Board determines to hold the meeting on a different
date. Any stockholder who gives notice of any such proposal shall deliver
therewith the text of the proposal to be presented and a brief
written statement of the reasons why such stockholder favors the proposal and
setting forth such stockholder\'s name and address, the number and class of
all shares of each class of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by
such stockholder and any material interest of such stockholder in the
proposal (other than as a stockholder). Any stockholder desiring to nominate
any person for election as a Director of the Corporation shall deliver with
such notice a statement in writing setting forth the name of the person to be
nominated, the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the
Corporation beneficially owned by such person, the information regarding such
person required by paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (or the corresponding
provisions of any regulation subsequently adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission applicable to the Corporation), such person\'s signed
consent to serve as a Director of the Corporation if elected, such
stockholder\'s name and address and the number and class of all shares of
each class of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such
stockholder. As used herein, shares "beneficially owned" shall mean
all shares as to which such person, together with such person\'s affiliates
and associates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934), may be deemed to beneficially own pursuant to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as all shares as to which
such person, together with such person\'s affiliates and associates, has the
right to become the beneficially owner pursuant to any agreement or
understanding, or upon the exercise of warrants, options or rights to convert
or exchange (whether such rights are exercisable immediately or only after
the passage of time or the occurrence of conditions). The person presiding at
the meeting, in addition to making any other determinations that may be
appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall determine whether such
notice has been duly given and shall direct that proposals and nominees not
be considered if such notice has not been given.      ARTICLE 3 
Directors   3.1 General Powers. Except as otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, the business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. The Board may adopt
such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws or applicable laws, as it may deem proper for
the conduct of its meetings and the management of the Corporation. In
addition to the powers expressly conferred by these Bylaws, the Board may
exercise all powers and perform all acts that are not required, by these
Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation or by statute, to be exercised and
performed by the stockholders.   3.2 Number and Election. Subject to the
rights, if any, of holders of preferred stock of the Corporation, the Board
of Directors shall consist of not less than seven nor more than fourteen
members, the exact number of which shall be fixed from time to time by the
Board of Directors. Except as provided elsewhere in the Certificate of
Incorporation, Directors shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at
annual meetings of stockholders, and each Director so elected shall hold
office as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. Directors need not be
stockholders.   3.3 Vacancies and Removal. Except as otherwise provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation, any vacancy in the Board of Directors,
including newly created directorships created by an increase in the number of
Directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors or by the
sole remaining Director. The Directors of the Corporation shall be divided
into three Classes, designated "Class I", "Class II" and "Class III"
respectively. The initial term of office of Class I shall expire on the date
of the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. The initial
term of office of Class II shall expire on the date of the 2002 annual
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, and the initial term of office of
Class III shall expire on the date of the 2003 annual meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation. Commencing with the annual meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation at which the initial term of office of the Class III Directors
expires, each Director elected to succeed those Directors whose terms have
thereupon expired shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third
annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which such
Director was elected.      In the event of any increase or decrease in
the authorized number of Directors, (a) each Director then serving as such
shall nonetheless continue as a Director of the class of which he is a member
until the expiration of his current term, or his earlier death, retirement,
resignation, or removal, and (b) the newly created or eliminated
directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned
by the Board among the three classes of Directors so as to maintain such
classes as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible. If such equality is
not possible, the increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes
in such a way that the difference in the number of Directors in any two
classes shall not exceed one.   3.4 Resignation. Any Director may resign at
any time by written notice to the Corporation. Such resignation shall take
effect at the time therein specified, and, unless otherwise specified in such
resignation, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to
make it effective.   3.5 Compensation. Each Director, in consideration of
his or her service as such, shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation
such amount per annum or such fees for attendance at Directors\' meetings, or
both, as the Board may from time to time determine, together with
reimbursement for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, if any, incurred by
such Director in connection with the performance of his or her duties. Each
Director who shall serve as a member of any committee of Directors in
consideration of serving as such shall be entitled to such additional amount
per annum or such fees for attendance at committee meetings, or both, as the
Board may from time to time determine, together with reimbursement for the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, if any, incurred by such Director in the
performance of his or her duties. Nothing contained in this Section 3.5 shall
preclude any Director from serving the Corporation or its subsidiaries in any
other capacity and receiving proper compensation therefor.   3.6 Times and
Places of Meetings. The Board may hold meetings, both regular and special,
either within or without the State of Delaware. The times and places for
holding meetings of the Board may be fixed from time to time by resolution of
the Board or (unless contrary to a resolution of the Board) in the notice of
the meeting.   3.7 Annual Meetings. On the day when and at the place where
the annual meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors is held, and
as soon as practicable thereafter, the Board may hold its annual meeting,
without notice of such meeting, for the purposes of organization, the
election of officers and the transaction of other business. The annual
meeting of the Board may be held at any other time and place specified in a
notice given as provided in Section 3.10 hereof for special meetings of the
Board or in a waiver of notice thereof.      3.8 Regular Meetings.
Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such times and at
such places as shall from time to time be determined by the Board.   3.9
Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board may be called by the

given by one of the means specified in Section 3.12 hereof other than by
mail, or on at least three days\' notice if given by mail. Special meetings
shall be called by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Secretary in like
manner and on like notice on the written request of any two or more of the
Directors then serving.   3.10 Telephone Meetings. Directors or members of
any committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting of the
Board or of such committee by means of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this
Section 3.10 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.   3.11
Adjourned Meetings. A majority of the Directors present at any meeting of the
Board, including an adjourned meeting, whether or not a quorum is present,
may adjourn such meeting to another time and place. At least one
day\'s notice of any adjourned meeting of the Board shall be given to each
Director whether or not present at the time of the adjournment, if such
notice shall be given by one of the means specified in Section 3.12 hereof
other than by mail, or at least three days\' notice if by mail. Any business
may be transacted at an adjourned meeting that might have been transacted at
the meeting as originally called.   3.12 Notice Procedure. Subject to
Sections 3.9 and 3.15 hereof, whenever, under the provisions of any statute,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, notice is required to be
given to any Director, such notice shall be deemed given effectively if given
in person or by telephone, by mail addressed to such Director at such
Director\'s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid, or by telegram, telex, telecopy or similar means
addressed as aforesaid.   3.13 Waiver of Notice. Whenever the giving of any
notice is required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, a waiver thereof, in writing, signed by the person or persons
entitled to said notice, whether before or after the event as to which such
notice is required, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance by a
person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting
except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Directors or a committee of Directors need
be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.      3.14
Organization. At each meeting of the Board, the Chairman, or in the absence
of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, or in the absence of the Chief
Executive Officer, a chairman chosen by a majority of the Directors present,
shall preside. The Secretary shall act as secretary at each meeting of the
Board. In case the Secretary shall be absent from any meeting of the
Board, an Assistant Secretary shall perform the duties of secretary at such
meeting; and in the absence from any such meeting of the Secretary and all
Assistant Secretaries, the person presiding at the meeting may appoint any
person to act as secretary of the meeting.   3.15 Quorum of Directors.
Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute or the Certificate of
Incorporation, the presence in person of a majority of the entire Board shall
be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business at any meeting of the Board, but a majority of a smaller number may
adjourn any such meeting to a later date.   3.16 Action by Majority Vote.
Except as otherwise expressly required by statute, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, the act of a majority of the Directors present
at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board.  
3.17 Action Without Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be

taken without a meeting if all Directors or members of such committee, as the

Certificates Representing Shares. Certificates representing the shares of
capital stock of the Corporation shall be in such form (consistent with the
provisions of Section 158 of the General Corporation Law) as shall
be approved by the Board. Such certificates shall be signed by the Chairman,
the Chief Executive Officer or a Vice President and by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, and may be
impressed with the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof. If the
Corporation is authorized to issue direct classes of shares or different
series within a class, the designations, relative rights, preferences, and
limitations applicable to each class and the variations in rights,
preferences, and limitations determined for each series (and the authority of
the Board to determine variations for future series) shall be summarized on
the front or back of each certificate of shares of such class or series.
Alternatively, each certificate may state conspicuously on its front or back
that the Corporation will furnish the stockholder this information on request
in writing and without charge. All certificates for shares shall be
consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name and address of the
person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of
shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the
Corporation. Any signatures on the stock certificates may be facsimiles. In
case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon any certificate shall have ceased to
be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is
issued, such certificate may, unless otherwise ordered by the Board, be
issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.      8.2
Transfer of Shares. Transfers of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the holder thereof or
by the holder\'s duly authorized attorney appointed by a power of attorney
duly executed and filed with the Secretary or a transfer agent of
the Corporation, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares of capital stock properly endorsed for transfer and
upon payment of all necessary transfer taxes. Every certificate exchanged,
returned or surrendered to the Corporation shall be marked "Canceled," with
the date of cancellation, by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the
transfer agent of the Corporation.   8.3 Registered Stockholders. The
Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the person or persons shown on its
original stock transfer books as the owner of shares as the exclusive and
only owner thereof for all purposes, including without limitation the right
to (i) receive dividends and other distribution; (ii) vote (except as
otherwise provided in the General Corporation Law); and (iii) examine lists,
books, minutes or other materials relating to the Corporation. The
Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to
or interest in such shares on the part of any other person noted in its
original stock transfer books, whether or not it shall have express or other
notice thereof.   8.4 Transfer and Registry Agents. The Corporation may from
time to time maintain one or more transfer offices or agents and registry
offices or agents at such place or places as may be determined from time to
time by the Board.   8.5 Lost, Destroyed, Stolen and Mutilated Certificates.
The holder of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall
immediately notify the Corporation of any loss, destruction, theft or
mutilation of the certificate representing such shares, and the Corporation
may issue a new certificate to replace the certificate alleged to have been
lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated. The Board may, in its discretion, as a
condition to the issue of any such new certificate, require the owner of the
lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificate, or his or her legal
representatives, to make proof satisfactory to the Board of such loss,
destruction, theft or mutilation and to advertise such fact in such manner as
the Board may require, and to give the Corporation and its transfer agents
and registrars, or such of them as the Board may require, a bond in such
form, in such sums and with such surety or sureties as the Board may direct,
to indemnify the Corporation and its transfer agents and registrars against
any claim that may be made against any of them on account of the continued
existence of any such certificate so alleged to have been lost, destroyed,
stolen or mutilated and against any expense in connection with
such claim.   8.6 Rules and Regulations. The Board may make such rules
and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these Bylaws
or with the Certificate of Incorporation, concerning the issue, transfer
and registration of certificates representing shares of its capital
stock.      ARTICLE 9  INDEMNIFICATION   9.1 Indemnity Undertaking. To
the extent not prohibited by law, the Corporation shall indemnify any person
who is or was made, or threatened to be made, a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (a "Proceeding"), whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including, without
limitation, an action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of
whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer
of the Corporation, or, at the request of the Corporation, is or was serving
as a Director or officer of any other corporation or in a capacity
with comparable authority or responsibilities for any partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (an "Other
Entity"), against judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid in
settlement and costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys\' fees,
disbursements and other charges). Persons who are not Directors or officers
of the Corporation (or otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
preceding sentence) may be similarly indemnified in respect of service to the
Corporation or to an Other Entity at the request of the Corporation to the
extent the Board at any time specifies that such persons are entitled to the
benefits of this Article 9.   9.2 Advancement of Expenses. The Corporation
shall reimburse or advance to any Director or officer or other person
entitled to indemnification hereunder the funds necessary for payment of
expenses, including attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any Proceeding, in advance of the final disposition of such
Proceeding; provided, however, that, if required by the General Corporation
Law, such expenses incurred by or on behalf of any Director or officer or
other person may be paid in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding
only upon receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of
such Director or officer (or other person indemnified hereunder), to repay
any such amount so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal that such
Director, officer or other person is not entitled to be indemnified for such
expenses.   9.3 Rights Not Exclusive. The rights to indemnification
and reimbursement or advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article 9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
a person seeking indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses
may have or hereafter be entitled under any statute, the Certificate
of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders
or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.   9.4 Continuation of Benefits. The rights to indemnification
and reimbursement or advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article 9 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
Director or officer (or other person indemnified hereunder) and shall inure
to the benefit of the executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of
such person.      9.5 Insurance. The Corporation shall have power to
purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent
of an Other Entity, against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such
person\'s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power
to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Article 9, the Certificate of Incorporation or under Section 145 of the
General Corporation Law or any other provision of law.   9.6 Binding
Effect. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
conferred in this Article shall be contract rights and such rights shall
continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director, officer,
employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee\'s heirs,
executors, and administrators. No repeal or modification of this Article 9
shall affect any rights or obligations with respect to any state of facts
then or theretofore existing or thereafter arising or any proceeding
theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part
upon any such state of facts.   9.7 Procedural Rights. The rights to
indemnification and reimbursement or advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article 9 shall be enforceable by any person
entitled to such indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses
in any court of competent jurisdiction. The burden of proving that such
indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses is not
appropriate shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Directors, its independent legal counsel and its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that such indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of
expenses is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Directors, its independent legal counsel and its
stockholders) that such person is not entitled to such indemnification or
reimbursement or advancement of expenses shall constitute a defense to the
action or create a presumption that such person is not so entitled. Such a
person shall also be indemnified for any expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his or her right to such indemnification or
reimbursement or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in any such
proceeding.      9.8 Service Deemed at Corporation\'s Request. Any
Director or officer of the Corporation serving in any capacity (a) another
corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
election of its Directors is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation
or (b) any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any corporation
referred to in clause (a) shall be deemed to be doing so at the request of
the Corporation.   ARTICLE 10  BOOKS AND RECORDS   10.1 Books and
Records. There shall be kept at the principal office of the Corporation
correct and complete records and books of account recording the financial
transactions of the Corporation and minutes of the proceedings of
the stockholders, the Board and any committee of the Board. The Corporation
shall keep at its principal office, or at the office of the transfer agent
or registrar of the Corporation, a record containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders, the number and class of shares held by each and the
dates when they respectively became the owners of record thereof.   10.2
Form of Records. Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular
course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account, and
minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards,
magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs, or any other information
storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into
clearly legible written form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall
so convert any records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to
inspect the same.   10.3 Inspection of Books and Records. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Board shall determine from time to time
whether, and, if allowed, when and under what conditions and regulations, the
accounts, books, minutes and other records of the Corporation, or any of
them, shall be open to the stockholders for inspection.      ARTICLE
11  SEAL   The corporate seal, if the Board elects to adopt one, shall
have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation, the year of its
organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware." The seal may be used
by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or otherwise
reproduced.   ARTICLE 12  FISCAL YEAR   The fiscal year of the
Corporation shall be fixed, and may be changed, by resolution of the
Board.   ARTICLE 13  PROXIES AND CONSENTS   Unless otherwise directed by
the Board, the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President, the
Secretary or the Treasurer, or any one of them, may execute and deliver on
behalf of the Corporation proxies respecting any and all shares or other
ownership interests of any Other Entity owned by the Corporation appointing
such person or persons as the officer executing the same shall deem proper to
represent and vote the shares or other ownership interests so owned at any
and all meetings of holders of shares or other ownership interests, whether
general or special, and/or to execute and deliver consents respecting such
shares or other ownership interests; or any of the aforesaid officers may
attend any meeting of the holders of shares or other ownership interests of
such Other Entity and thereat vote or exercise any or all other powers of the
Corporation as the holder of such shares or other ownership interests.  
ARTICLE 14  OFFICES   14.1 Registered Office. The registered office of the
Corporation shall be at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, City of
Wilmington, County of Newcastle, State of Delaware; and its registered agent
at such address is Corporation Trust Company.   14.2 Other Offices. The
Corporation may also have offices, including its principal office, at such
other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board may
from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may
require.      ARTICLE 15  EMERGENCY BYLAWS   Unless the Certificate of
Incorporation provides otherwise, the following provisions of this Article 15
shall be effective during an emergency, which is defined as when a quorum of
the Corporation\'s Directors cannot be readily assembled because of some
catastrophic event. During such emergency:   15.1 Notice to Board Members.
Any one member of the Board or any one of the following officers: Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President, Secretary, or Treasurer, may

practical manner, including by publication and radio. Such notice shall be
given at least six hours prior to commencement of the meeting.   15.2
Temporary Directors and Quorum. One or more officers of the Corporation
present at the emergency Board meeting, as is necessary to achieve a quorum,
shall be considered to be Directors for the meeting, and shall so serve in
order of rank, and within the same rank, in order of seniority. In the
event that less than a quorum of the Directors are present (including any
officers who are to serve as Directors for the meeting), those Directors
present (including the officers serving as Directors) shall constitute a
quorum.   15.3 Actions Permitted To Be Taken. The Board as constituted in
Section 15.2, and after notice as set forth in Section 15.1 may:   15.3.1
prescribe emergency powers to any officer of the  Corporation;   15.3.2

15.3.3 designate lines of succession of officers and agents,  in the event
that any of them are unable to discharge their duties;   15.3.4 relocate the
principal place of business, or designate  successive or simultaneous

helpful or necessary action  to carry on the business of the
Corporation.      ARTICLE 16  AMENDMENTS   These Bylaws of the
Corporation may be altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted (i) at
any annual or special meeting of stockholders, by the affirmative vote of not
less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast by all of the then

Christopher L. Bennett, Esq.  Foster A. Stewart,
Jr. -------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------  To whom it may concern:   I
have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of MeriStar Hotels and Resorts, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("MeriStar"), as that term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d)
of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the "Act"). Neither my entering into this agreement,
nor anything contained herein, shall be deemed an admission on my part that I
am such an "affiliate."   Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated as of December 8, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement"), among
American Skiing Company, a Delaware corporation ("ASC"), ASC Merger Sub,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), and MeriStar providing for the
merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into MeriStar, and as a result
of the Merger, I may receive shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of ASC (the "ASC Common Stock") in exchange for the shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MeriStar owned by me at the Effective
Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger.   I represent and
warrant to ASC and Merger Sub that in such event:   A. I shall not make any
sale, transfer or other disposition of ASC Common Stock in violation of the
Act or the Rules and Regulations.   B. I have carefully read this letter and
the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable
limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of ASC
Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for
MeriStar.        C. I have been advised that the issuance of ASC Common
Stock to me pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the Commission
under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also
been advised that, since at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of
the stockholders of MeriStar I may have been deemed to have been an affiliate
of MeriStar and a distribution by me of ASC Common Stock has not been
registered under the Act, ASC Common Stock must be held by me indefinitely
unless (i) a distribution of ASC Common Stock by me has been registered under
the Act, (ii) a sale of ASC Common Stock by me is made in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under
the Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to ASC, some
other exemption from registration is available with respect to a proposed
sale, transfer or other disposition of ASC Common Stock.   D. I understand
that neither ASC nor Merger Sub is under any obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of ASC Common Stock by me or on my behalf or to
take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption
from registration available.   E. I also understand that unless the transfer
by me of my ASC Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale
made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, ASC reserves the right to
put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:   The
offer and sale of the shares represented by this  certificate have not been
registered under the Securities  Act of 1933, and these shares were acquired
from a person  who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 
promulgated under the Securities Act applies. The shares  have been acquired
by the holder not with a view to, or for  resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof within  the meaning of the Securities Act and may not be
sold,  pledged or otherwise transferred except in a transaction  registered
under the Securities Act in accordance with an  exemption from the
registration requirements of the  Securities Act.   It is understood and
agreed that the legends set forth in paragraph E and F above shall be removed
by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if the undersigned
shall have delivered to ASC a copy of a letter from the staff of
the       Commission, or an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to
ASC to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the
Act.   Very truly yours,    ------------------------
