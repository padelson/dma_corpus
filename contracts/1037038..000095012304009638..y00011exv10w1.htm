The Accrued Expenses amount shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and reflect the amounts due and outstanding as of the Closing Date for the respective categories included in Schedule 1.1 notwithstanding the Sellers historical accounting practices therefor. The Adjusted Inventory Amount shall be determined using the agreed-upon valuation assumptions set forth in Schedule 3.4(a)    #####

However, if, after 30 days following the receipt by the Buyer of the Dispute Report, the Seller and the Buyer are unable to resolve any Disputed Matter, such Disputed Matter shall be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP ("PWC"), or if PWC is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, an independent nationally recognized    ##### 

  

    

accounting firm mutually selected by Buyer and Seller (the
"Arbitrator"). Each of the Seller and the Buyer may submit such written
evidence and supporting documentation as they deem appropriate to the
Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall not hold any hearings or accept oral
testimony. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Arbitrator shall
be limited to the items in dispute that were timely and properly included in
Dispute Report and the Arbitrator is not to make any other determination. The
Arbitrator in making its determination shall not assign a value greater than
the greatest value for such item claim by either party or a smaller than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Arbitrator shall be
instructed to use every reasonable effort to make its determination with

The Buyer shall consult with the Seller in the preparation of each Earn-Out Report. Each Earn-Out Report shall be binding upon all parties hereto if the Seller delivers written notification to the Buyer of its acceptance of the statement of the portion of the Contingent Purchase Price payable with respect to such Earn-Out Eligible Period as set forth in the Earn-Out Report (the "Notice of Acceptance"), or if the Seller shall not have given to the Buyer a written notice of its disagreement with such Earn-Out Report (a "Notice of Disagreement") within 30 days after its receipt of such Earn-Out Report. During such 30-day period, upon prior notice by the Seller, the Buyer shall allow the Seller reasonable access during regular business hours to the books, records and accounts of the Buyer reasonably related to the preparation of the Earn-Out Report to allow them to examine each Earn-Out Report. Any such Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. During the 30-day period following the delivery of any Notice of Disagreement, the parties hereto will attempt to resolve in good faith any disputed items. Failing such resolution, all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and not so resolved (the "Earn-Out Disputed Matters") shall be referred to PWC, or if PWC is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, an independent nationally recognized accounting firm mutually selected by Buyer and Seller (the "Earn-Out Arbitrator") for resolution. The Earn-Out Arbitrator shall consider only the Earn-Out Disputed Matters and the Earn-Out Arbitrator is not to make any other determination. The Earn-Out Arbitrator in making its determination shall not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claim by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Earn-Out Arbitrator shall be instructed to act promptly to resolve all Earn-Out Disputed Matters and its decision with respect to all Earn-Out Disputed Matters shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto with respect to such Earn-Out Disputed Matters.

Upon resolution by the Earn-Out Arbitrator of all Earn-Out Disputed Matters, the Earn-Out Arbitrator shall cause to be prepared and shall deliver to the Seller and the Buyer a final and definitive earn-out report (the "Definitive Earn-Out Report"), which shall (i) reflect the determination of the Earn-Out Arbitrator with respect to any Earn-Out Disputed Matters and (ii) be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto with respect to such Earn-Out Disputed Matters. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall bear all costs, fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with such dispute resolution, and the Seller and Buyer shall share equally all of the costs, fees and expenses of the Earn-Out Arbitrator.   

 (b) The Annual Deferred Payments, the Supplemental Deferred Purchase Price Payments and the Contingent Purchase Price Payments payable to the Seller shall be calculated and paid as follows, subject at all times to the limitations described in Section 3.5(b)(iv) and subject to the provisions of Section 10.4:    #####

If the Indemnifying Party chooses to control the defense of any Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense (in the judgment of counsel engaged by the Indemnifying Party). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control the defense of the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election within such 30-day period, or has not otherwise satisfied the Control Conditions, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Asserted Liability; provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not have the right to control the defense of an Asserted Liability under this Article X, the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise the Asserted Liability without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Indemnified Party will have the right to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Partys expense and to control its own defense of such action or proceeding if the named parties to any such litigation include the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and, if the Indemnified Party has reasonably determined that the representation of both parties would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts between the parties.    ##### 

  

  

 (e) Obligation of the Indemnified Party. The party that controls the defenses of an Asserted Liability shall diligently defend such third party claim.   

 (f) Consent to Settlement. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of an Asserted Liability, no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law by the Indemnified Party and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (C) the Indemnified Party is released from all liability with respect to such Asserted Liability.   

 (g) Payment of the Indemnification. Subject to Section 12.13 (Late Payments), the Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified Party the indemnification due under this Article X as soon as the Asserted Liability has been settled in accordance with this Article X, or, failing such agreement, the case has been concluded by a final and binding Order by any Governmental Authority.   

 10.4 Set-Off.   

 (a) Each of the Seller and the Seller Affiliate Group agrees and acknowledges that the Buyer shall have the right in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.4, but not the obligation, to set-off against all or any portion of the Additional Purchase Price payable, pursuant to Section 3.5, (i) Losses claimed by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article X and (ii) any amounts payable by the Seller to the Buyer under Section 3.4 ("Purchase Price Adjustment"). If a Buyer Indemnified Party has previously delivered one or more Claims Notices in accordance with Section 10.3(b) of this Agreement and there exists unresolved indemnification claims as set forth in the Claims Notices or the Buyer is owed a Purchase Price Adjustment at the time that any Additional Purchase Price payment is due from Buyer, the Buyer may give written notice to Seller of its election to exercise its set-off rights under this Section 10.4, which notice shall include a calculation of the Set-Off-Amount (as defined below) (the "Set-Off Notice"). Buyer shall be entitled to set-off an amount of any Additional Purchase Price payment then due and owing in the manner set forth in Section 10.4(b) by an amount equal to the sum of (x) amount of the Losses set forth in the Claims Notices for the unresolved claims set forth therein (the "Unresolved Claim Losses") and (y) the Purchase Price Adjustment amount; provided; that if no claim amount was set forth in the Claims Note for an unresolved claim, the Buyer shall determine a reasonable damage amount for such claim for purposes of determining the set-off amount (the "Set-Off Amount"). Any portion of the Additional Purchase Price that is not set-off under this Section 10.4 shall be paid to the Seller within the time period provided in Section 3.5.   

 (b) The Set-Off Amount shall be deposited by the Buyer into an escrow account with an independent escrow agent pursuant to an escrow agreement entered into by the Buyer, Seller and such escrow agent until such time as all of the unresolved claims have been finally determined and the Purchase Price Adjustment    ##### 

  

 

amount, if any, has been paid to the Buyer; provided that in no event shall
the Set-Off Amount deposited by the Buyer in escrow exceed the sum of the
Unresolved Claim Losses and the Purchase Price Adjustment amount then due, if
any, and any excess shall be promptly paid to the Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The escrow agreement referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence shall be in the form reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and shall provide that all fees, expenses and costs of
the escrow agent shall be paid by the Buyer. If the Buyer is owed a Purchase
Price Adjustment or any unresolved claims are finally determined in favor of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Buyer shall be entitled to instruct the
escrow agent to pay Buyer the portion of the Set-Off Amount being held in
escrow equal to the sum of (x) the Purchase Price Adjustment amount then
payable to Buyer, if any, and (y) amount of the Losses payable to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in respect of such finally determined claim. If, after
the final determination of an unresolved claim, the Set-Off Amount (as
reduced for amounts paid to Buyer in accordance with the prior sentence) is
greater than the amount of Losses claimed in the Claims Notice for all then
unresolved claims, the escrow agent shall promptly pay to Seller such excess
amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds.    

 10.5 Limitations on Indemnification.   

 (a) Except in the case of fraud, the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties under Section 10.1(a), other than those based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of Section 4.5 (Tax Matters), Section 4.7 (Authority to Execute and Perform), Section 4.12 (a) (Title to Assets) and Section 4.15 (Environmental, Health and Safety Matters) (the "Basket Exclusions"), until the aggregate amount of indemnification therefor under Section 10.1(a), exclusive of those based on the Basket Exclusions, equals Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (such amount the "Basket Amount"), whereupon the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts for indemnification under Section 10.1(a).   

 (b) The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall be obligated, to pay any amounts for indemnification based on the Basket Exclusions without regard to the individual or aggregate amounts thereof and without regard to whether all other indemnification payments shall have exceeded, in the aggregate, the Basket Amount.   

 (c) Except in the case of fraud, the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification for breaches of representations and warranties under Section 10.1(a) (other than the Basket Exclusions) in excess of Fifty-Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in the aggregate for all such claims thereunder.   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud, none of Seller Indemnifying Parties shall have any obligation to indemnify any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for breaches of representations and warranties under Section 10.1(a) for incidental, consequential,    ##### 

  

 

exemplary, special or punitive damages or any lost profits;
provided, however, that any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover any such damages from any of the Seller Indemnifying
Parties to the extent that such damages are actually assessed against such
Buyer Indemnified Parties as a result of a third party proceeding in a court
of competent jurisdiction for which such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification under this Article X.    

 10.6 Sole Remedy. Except for fraud and any equitable remedy that may be available to a party under this Agreement in respect of a breach of a covenant hereunder or in any Transaction Agreement or for a breach of the Non-Compete Agreements or the non-compete provisions contained in the Employment Agreements, an Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification as provided for in this Article X shall constitute such Indemnified Partys sole remedy for a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement or in a certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and an Indemnifying Party shall have no other liability to an Indemnified Party resulting from such breach.   

ARTICLE XI

 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as follows:

 (b) at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by mutual written consent of the Seller and the Buyer;   

 (c) at the election of the Seller or the Buyer by written notice to the other parties hereto after 5:00 p.m., New York time, on July 31, 2004, if the Closing shall not have occurred, unless such date is extended by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the Buyer; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;   

 (d) at the election of the Seller, if there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days of notice to the Buyer of such breach; or    ##### 

  

  

 (e) at the election of the Buyer, if there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Seller contained in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days notice to the Seller of such breach.   

 If this Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and void and have no further force or effect, except as provided in Section 11.2.   

 11.2 Survival. If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated as described above, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of Article I, Section 6.7 (Expenses), this Section 11.2, Section 12.6 (Governing Law), Section 12.7 (Submission to Jurisdiction) and 12.8 (Waiver of Jury Trial) which shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that (x) none of the parties hereto shall have any liability in respect of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(b) or Section 11.1(c) and (y) nothing shall relieve any of the parties from liability for actual damages resulting from a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(e).
