a Claims Notice so long as (i)&nbsp;the Asserted Liability is not, in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to result in an amount of Losses

asserted against the Indemnifying Party that are then pending or have been
previously resolved) that will exceed the Indemnifying Party&#146;s maximum

Asserted Liability (collectively, the &#147;<B>Control Conditions</B>&#148;). If the
Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, it
shall, within 30&nbsp;days of its receipt of a Claims Notice (or sooner, if the
nature of the Asserted Liability so requires), notify the Indemnified Party of
its intent to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, in the defense against, or compromise of, such
Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to control the defense
of any Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any
books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or
appropriate for such defense (in the judgment of counsel engaged by the
Indemnifying Party). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control the
defense of the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election within such 30-day period, or has not otherwise satisfied the Control
Conditions, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, such Asserted Liability; provided that if the
Indemnifying Party does not have the right to control the defense of an
Asserted Liability under this Article&nbsp;X, the Indemnified Party shall not settle
or compromise the Asserted Liability without the consent of the Indemnifying
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Indemnified
Party will have the right to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying
Party&#146;s expense and to control its own defense of such action or proceeding if
the named parties to any such litigation include the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party and, if the Indemnified Party has reasonably determined that
the representation of both parties would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential conflicts between the parties.
